Title: Virtual Memory Mapped Network Interface for the SHRIMP Multicomputer
Abstract: The network interfaces of existing multicomputersrequire a significant amount of software overheadat the operating system and user levels to provideprotection and to implement message passing protocols.This paper describes the design of a low-latency,high-bandwidth, virtual memory-mapped network interfacefor the SHRIMP multicomputer project atPrinceton University. Without sacrificing protection,the network interface achieves low latency by usingvirtual memory mapping and write-latency hidingtechniques, and obtains high bandwidth by providinga user-level block data transfer mechanism. We haveimplemented several message passing primitives in anexperimental environment, demonstrating that ourapproach can reduce the message passing overheadto a few user-level instructions.1 IntroductionThe new trend of constructing parallel systems fromcommodity, off-the-shelf components offers a greatcost/performance advantage over traditional customdesignedparallel systems.

Title: Intelligent Agents: Theory and Practice
Abstract: The concept of an agent has become important in both ArtificialIntelligence (AI) and mainstream computer science. Our aim in thispaper is to point the reader at what we perceive to be the mostimportant theoretical and practical issues associated with the designand construction of intelligent agents. For convenience, we dividethese issues into three areas (though as the reader will see, thedivisions are at times somewhat arbitrary). Agent theory is concernedwith the question of what an agent is, and the use of mathematicalformalisms for representing and reasoning about the properties ofagents. Agent architectures can be thought of as software engineeringmodels of agents

Title: Visual Information Seeking: Tight Coupling of Dynamic Query Filters with Starfield Displays
Abstract: This paper offers new principles for visual information seeking(VIS). A key concept is to support browsing, which is distinguishedfrom familiar query composition and information retrieval because ofits emphasis on rapid filtering to reduce result sets, progressiverefinement of search parameters, continuous reformulation of goals,and visual scanning to identify results. VIS principles developedinclude: dynamic query filters (query parameters are rapidly adjustedwith sliders, buttons, maps, etc.), starfield displays(two-dimensional scatterplots to structure result sets and zooming toreduce clutter), and tight coupling (interrelating query componentsto preserve display invariants and support progressive refinementcombined with an emphasis on using search output to foster searchinput).

Title: Implementing network protocols at user level
Abstract: Traditionally, network software has been structured in a monolithicfashion with all protocol stacksexecuting either within the kernel or in a single trusted user-levelserver. This organization is motivatedby performance and security concerns. However, considerations of codemaintenance, ease ofdebugging, customization, and the simultaneous existence of multipleprotocols argue for separating theimplementations into more manageable user-level libraries ofprotocols. This paper describes the designand implementation of transport protocols as user-level libraries.We begin by motivating the need for protocol implementations asuser-level libraries and placingour approach in the context of previous work. We then describe ouralternative to monolithic protocolorganization, which has been implemented on Mach workstationsconnected not only to traditionalEthernet, but also to a more modern network, the DEC SRC AN1.

Title: Hints for Computer System Design
Abstract: Studying the design and implementation of a number of computer hasled to some general hints for system design. They are described hereand illustrated by many examples, ranging from hardware such as theAlto and the Dorado to application programs such as Bravo and Star.1. Introduction Designing a computer system is very different fromdesigning an algorithm: The external interface (that is, therequirement) is less precisely defined, more complex, and moresubject to change. The system has much more internal structure, andhence many internal interfaces. The measure of success is much lessclear. The designer usually finds himself floundering in a sea ofpossibilities, unclear about how one choice will limit his freedom tomake other choices, or affect the size and performance of the entiresystem. There probably isn't a `best' way to build the system, oreven any major part of it; much more important is to avoid choosing aterrible way, and to have clear division of responsibiliti...

Title: An Implementation of the Hamlyn Sender-Managed Interface Architecture
Abstract: IntroductionProcessors are rapidly getting faster, and message-passingmulticomputer interconnections are doing the same,thanks to recent developments in Gb/s links and lowlatencypacket switches. But the cost of passing messagesbetween applications also includes the overhead ofcrossing interfaces between the operating system (OS), adevice driver, and the hardware, which can be orders ofmagnitude more than the cost of moving a message's bitsacross the wires.Hamlyn is an architecture for processor-interconnectioninterfaces that addresses this difficulty. It achieves bothlow latency and high bandwidth, isolates applicationsfrom each other's mistakes, and supplies a rich set ofmessage-delivery semantics. It does so by exploitingseveral techniques:. Sender-based memory management. Senders, notreceivers, choose the destination memory address atwhich messages are deposited. This means thatmessages are sent only when the sender knows th

Title: Real Time Groupware as a Distributed System: Concurrency Control and Its Effect on the Interface
Abstract: This paper exposes the concurrency control problem ingroupware when it is implemented as a distributed system.Traditional concurrency control methods cannot be applieddirectly to groupware because system interactions includespeople as well as computers. Methods, such as locking,serialization, and their degree of optimism, are shown tohave quite different impacts on the interface and howoperations are displayed and perceived by group members.The paper considers both human and technicalconsiderations that designers should ponder before choosinga particular concurrency control method. It also reviews ourwork-in-progress designing and implementing a library ofconcurrency schemes in GROUPKIT, a groupware toolkit.KEYWORDS: Real time groupware, computer supportedcooperative work, distributed systems, concurrency controlalgorithms.INTRODUCTIONReal time distributed groupware allows two or moregeographically-separated people to work together at thesame time through a comput...

Title: Constraint Hierarchies and Logic Programming
Abstract: Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) is a general scheme for extendinglogic programming to include constraints. It is parameterized by D,the domain of the constraints. However, CLP(D) languages, as well asmost other constraint systems, only allow the programmer to specifyconstraints that must hold. In many applications, such as interactivegraphics, page layout, and decision support, one needs to expresspreferences as well as strict requirements. If we wish to make fulluse of the constraint paradigm, we need ways to represent thesedefaults and preferences declaratively, as constraints, rather thanencoding them in the procedural parts of the language. We describe ascheme for extending CLP(D) to include both required and preferentialconstraints, with an arbitrary number of strengths of preference. Wepresent some of the theory of such languages, and an algorithm forexecuting them. To test our ideas, we have implemented an interpreterfor an instance of this language scheme with D equal to the reals. Wedescribe our interpreter, and outline some examples of using thislanguage.

Title: Measured capacity of an Ethernet: myths and reality
Abstract: Ethernet, a 10 Mbit/sec CSMA/CD network, is one of the mostsuccessfulLAN technologies. Considerable confusion exists as to the actualcapacity ofan Ethernet, especially since some theoretical studies have examinedoperatingregimes that are not characteristic of actual networks. Based onmeasurements of an actual implementation, we show that for a wideclass ofapplications, Ethernet is capable of carrying its nominal bandwidthof usefultraffic, and allocates the bandwidth fairly. We discuss howimplementationscan achieve this performance, describe some problems that have ariseninexisting implementations, and suggest ways to avoid future problems.This paper was originally published in Proceedings of the SIGCOMM '88Symposium onCommunications Architectures and Protocols, ACM SIGCOMM, Stanford,California, August1988.Copyright Ó 1988 Association for Computing MachineryPermission to copy without fee all or part of this material isgranted provided that the copiesare not made ...

Further, there are no toolkits for building3D user interfaces. We present a system which allows experimentationwith 3D widgets, encapsulated 3D geometry and behavior. Ourwidgets are first-class objects in the same 3D environment used todevelop the application. This integration of widgets and applicationobjects provides a higher bandwidth between interface and applicationthan exists in more traditional UI toolkit-based interfaces.

Title: Pad: An Alternative Approach to the Computer Interface
Abstract: We believe that navigation in information spaces is bestsupported by tapping into our natural spatial and geographicways of thinking. To this end, we are developinga new computer interface model called Pad.The ongoing Pad project uses a spatial metaphorfor computer interface design. It provides an intuitivebase for the support of such applications as electronicmarketplaces, information services, and on-line collaboration.Pad is an infinite two dimensional informationplane that is shared among users, much as a network filesystem is shared. Objects are organized geographically;every object occupies a well defined region on the Padsurface.For navigation, Pad uses "portals" - magnifying glassesthat can peer into and roam over different parts of thissingle infinite shared desktop; links to specific itemsare established and broken continually as the portal'sview changes. Portals can recursively look onto otherportals. This paradigm enables the sort of peripheralactivity ge...

Abstract: Interface builders only support the construction of the menus anddialogue boxes of an application. They do not support theconstruction of interfaces of many application classes(visualization, simulation, command and control, domain-specificeditors) because of the dynamic and complex information that theseapplications process. HUMANOID is a model-based interface design andconstruction tool where interfaces are specified by building adeclarative description (model) of their presentation and behavior.HUMANOID' s modeling language provides simple abstraction, iterationand conditional constructs to model the interface features of theseapplication classes. HUMANOID provides an easy-touse designer'sinterface that lets designers build complex interfaces withoutprogramming.

Abstract: The vnode interface has succeeded in supporting a wide range of filesystem implementations over its 6-year history. During that time ithas also had to accommodate evolution in file system semantics, andin the relationship between the file system and the virtual memorysystem. The effects of this evolution have been less than elegant,and pressures for further evolution are mounting. The evolution ofthe interface is reviewed in order to identify the problems it hascaused, and a more robust revision of the interface design proposed.This design also permits new file systems to be implemented in termsof pre-existing file system implementations; it is more like theStreams interface in this respect.

Abstract: Synthesis of systems containing application-specific as well asreprogrammable components, such as off-the-shelf microprocessors,provides a promising approach to realization of complex systems usinga minimal amount of application-specific hardware while still meetingthe required performance constraints.

The input system model ispartitioned into hardware and software components based on imposedperformance constraints. Synchronization between various elements ofa mixed system design is one of the key issues that any synthesissystem must address. In this paper, we consider software andinterface synchronization schemes that facilitate communicationbetween system components.

Title: Survey on User Interface Programming
Abstract: This paper reports on the results of a survey of user interfaceprogramming. The survey was widely distributed, andwe received 74 responses. The results show that in today'sapplications, an average of 48% of the code is devoted tothe user interface portion. The average time spent on theuser interface portion is 45% during the design phase, 50%during the implementation phase, and 37% during themaintenance phase. 34% of the systems were implementedusing a toolkit, 27% used a UIMS, 14% used an interfacebuilder, and 26% used no tools. The projects using onlytoolkits spent the largest percentage of the time and codeon the user interface (around 60%) compared to around45% for those with no tools. This appears to be becausethe toolkit systems had more sophisticated user interfaces.The projects using UIMSs or interface builders spent theleast percent of time and code on the user interface (around41%) suggesting that these tools are effective. In general,people were happy with the tools they used, especially thegraphical interface builders. The most common problemspeople reported when developing a user interface includedgetting users' requirements, writing help text, achievingconsistency, learning how to use the tools, getting acceptableperformance, and communicating among various partsof the program.

Title: Adaptive Web Sites: an AI Challenge
Abstract: The creation of a complex web site is a thorny problem in userinterface design. First, different visitors have distinct goals.Second, even a single visitor may have different needs at differenttimes. Much of the information at the site may also be dynamic ortime-dependent. Third, as the site grows and evolves, its originaldesign may no longer be appropriate. Finally, a site may be designedfor a particular purpose but used in unexpected ways. Web serversrecord data about user interactions and accumulate this data overtime. We believe that AI techniques can be used to examine useraccess logs in order to automatically improve the site. We challengethe AI community to create adaptive web sites: sites thatautomatically improve their organization and presentation based onuser access data. Several unrelated research projects in planrecognition, machine learning, knowledge representation, and usermodeling have begun to explore aspects of this problem. We hope thatposing this cha...

Title: The Amulet Environment: New Models for Effective User Interface Software Development
Abstract: The Amulet user interface development environment makes it easier forprogrammers tocreate highly-interactive, graphical user interface software forUnix, Windows orMacintosh. Amulet uses new models for objects, constraints,animation, input, output,commands, and undo. The object system is a prototype-instance modelin which there isno distinction between classes and instances or between methods anddata. The constraintsystem allows any value of any object to be computed by arbitrarycode and supportsmultiple constraint solvers. Animations can be attached to existingobjects with a singleline of code. Input from the user is handled by"Interactor" objects which support reuse ofbehavior objects. The output model provides a declarative definitionof the graphics, andsupports automatic refresh. Command objects encapsulate all of theinformation neededabout operations, including support for various ways to undo them. Ankey feature of theAmulet design is that all graphical objec...

Title: Dynamic Queries for Visual Information Seeking
Abstract: Dynamic queries are a novel approach to information seeking that mayenable users to cope withinformation overload. They allow users to see an overview of thedatabase, rapidly (100 msecupdates) explore and conveniently filter out unwanted information.Users fly through informationspaces by incrementally adjusting a query (with sliders, buttons, andother filters) whilecontinuously viewing the changing results. Dynamic queries on thechemical table of elements,computer directories, and a real estate database were built andtested in three separate exploratoryexperiments.

Title: A High-Level and Flexible Framework for Implementing Multiuser User Interfaces
Abstract: We have developed a high-level and flexible framework for supportingthe construction of multi-user user-interfaces. The framework isbased on a generalized editing interaction model, which allows usersto view programs as active data that can be concurrently edited bymultiple users. It consists of several novel components including arefinement of both the Seeheim UIMS architecture and the distributedgraphics architecture that explicitly addresses multi-userinteraction; the abstractions of shared active variables andinteraction variables, which allow users and applications to exchangeinformation; a set of default collaboration rules designed to keepthe collaboration-awareness low in multi- user programs; and a smallbut powerful set of primitives for overriding these rules. Theframework allows users to be dynamically added and removed from amulti-user session, different users to use different user interfacesto interact with an application, the modules interacting with aparticular user to execute on the local workstation, and program-mers to incrementally trade automation for flexibility. We haveimplemented the framework as part of a system called Suite. Thispaper motivates, describes, and illustrates the framework using theconcrete example of Suite, discusses how it can be implemented inother kinds of systems, compares it with related work, discusses itsshortcom- ings, and suggests directions for future work.

Title: PIOUS: A Scalable Parallel I/O System for Distributed Computing Environments
Abstract: PIOUS is a parallel file system architecture that providescost-effective, scalable bandwidth in a network computingenvironment. PIOUS employs data declustering, to exploit the combinedfile I/O and buffer cache capacities of networked computingresources, and transaction-based concurrency control, to guaranteeaccess consistency without explicit synchronization. This paperpresents preliminary results from a prototype PIOUS implementation. 1Introduction Parallel programming environments that exploit networkedcomputing resources offer a costeffective alternative to traditionalparallel machines. Environments such as PVM [Sun90] and Linda [ABC +90], among others [Tur93], enable parallel-distributed applicationdevelopment by providing mechanisms for interprocess communication,synchronization and concurrency control, fault tolerance, and processmanagement. However, many parallel applications require or couldbenefit from a unified parallel I/O system that such environmentsgener...

Title: Adaptive Web Sites: Automatically Synthesizing Web Pages
Abstract: The creation of a complex web site is a thorny problem in userinterface design. In IJCAI '97, we challenged the AI community toaddress this problem by creating adaptive web sites: sites thatautomatically improve their organization and presentation by miningvisitor access data collected in Web server logs. In this paper weintroduce our own approach to this broad challenge. Specifically, weinvestigate the problem of index page synthesis --- the automaticcreation of pages that facilitate a visitor's navigation of a Website. First, we formalize this problem as a clustering problem andintroduce a novel approach to clustering, which we call clustermining: Instead of attempting to partition the entire data space intodisjoint clusters, we search for a small number of cohesive (andpossibly overlapping) clusters. Next, we present PageGather, acluster mining algorithm that takes Web server logs as input andoutputs the contents of candidate index pages. Finally, we showexperimental...

Messaging costsare strongly influenced by a machine's network interfacearchitecture.We examine the impact of architectural support for messagingin two machines -- the TMC CM-5 and the Cray T3D -- by exploringthe design and performance of several messaging implementations.The additional features in the T3D support remote operations: memoryaccess, fetch-and-increment, atomic swaps, and prefetch.Experiments on the CM-5 show that requiring processor involvementfor message reception can increase the communicationoverheads from 60% to 300% for moderate variations in computationgrain size at the destination. In contrast, the T3D hardwarefor remote operations decouples message reception from processoractivity, producing high-performance messaging independentof computation grain size or variability.In addition, hardware support for a shared address space in theT3D can be us...

Title: Interactive Sketching for the Early Stages of User Interface Design
Abstract: Current interactive user interface construction tools are often moreof a hindrance thana benefit during the early stages of interface design. These toolsare hard to use andthey encourage designers and evaluators to focus on the wrong issues,such as color,fonts, and alignment, at this early stage. Most designers preferinstead to sketch earlyinterface ideas on paper. However, designing on paper also has manydrawbacks.Paper-based designs are hard to edit and cannot easily be tested withusers. This dissertationdescribes the design, implementation, and evaluation of aninteractive sketchingtool called SILK that overcomes these problems and combines many ofthe benefits ofpaper-based sketching with current electronic tools.SILK allows designers to quickly sketch an interface using anelectronic pad andstylus.

Title: Open Implementation Design Guidelines
Abstract: Designing reusable software modules can be extremely difficult. Thedesign must be balanced between being general enough to address theneeds of a wide range of clients and being focused enough to trulysatisfy the requirements of each specific client. One area where itcan be particularly difficult to strike this balance is in theimplementation strategy of the module. The problem is thatgeneralpurpose implementation strategies, tuned for a wide range ofclients, aren't necessarily optimal for each specific client ---thisis especially an issue for modules that are intended to be reusableand yet provide high-performance. An examination of existing softwaresystems shows that an increasingly important technique for handlingthis problem is to design the module's interface in such a way thatthe client can assist or participate in the selection of the module's implementation strategy. We call this approach openimplementation. When designing the interface to a module that allowsit...

VMMC has beendesigned and implemented for the SHRIMP multicomputerwhere it delivers user-to-user latency and bandwidth closeto the limits imposed by the underlying hardware. Thegoal of this work is to provide an implementation ofVMMC on a commercially available hardware platform;to determine whether the benefits of VMMC can be realizedon the new hardware; and to investigate network interfacedesign tradeoffs by comparing SHRIMP with Myrinet andits respective VMMC implementation.Our Myrinet implementation of VMMC achieves 9.8microseconds one-way latency and provides 108.4 MBytesper second user-to-user bandwidth. Compared to SHRIMP,the Myrinet implementation of VMMC incurs relativelyhigher overhead and demands more network interfaceresources (LANai processor, on-board SRAM) but requiresless operating system support.1.

Title: Extending Hierarchical Constraint Logic Programming: Nonmonotonicity and Inter-Hierarchy Comparison
Abstract: Hierarchical Constraint Logic Programming languages extend ConstraintLogic Programming toinclude constraint hierarchies. These languages provide both requiredconstraints and default constraintsof various strengths. In the original definition of HCLP, alternatesolutions to a givenconstraint hierarchy were compared, and only the "best"solutions were returned. However, therewas no attempt to compare solutions arising from different choices ofrules in the logic program. Inmany practical applications of HCLP, to rule out unintuitivesolutions we do need to make such interhierarchy comparisons. Such comparisons introduce nonmonotonic behavior inHCLP programs. Wedefine two related nonmonotonicity properties of HCLP languages, andcompare these propertieswith those of standard nonmonotonic logics. The nonmonotonicityproperties create novel implementationproblems, which we discuss, while at the same time extending theusefulness of HCLPlanguages.Authors' addresses:Departmen...

The proposedframework has been incorporated intoDistEdit, a toolkit for building group text-editors. Based on ourexperience with DistEdit's undo facilities,we discuss several issues that need to be taken into account in usingthe framework, in order to ensure that areasonable undo behavior is provided to users. We show that theframework is also applicable to single-usersystems, since the operations to undo can be selected not just on thebasis of who performed them, but byany appropriate criterion, such as the document region in which theoperations occurred or the time intervalin which the operations were carried out.Categories and Subject Descriptors: D.2.2 [Software Engineering]:Tools and Techniques -- User Interfaces;H.1.2 [Models and Principles]: User/Machine Systems -- Human Factors;H.2.2 [Database

These systems and theirinterfaces are generally tightly-coupled and well-defined. Forlarge-scale humanrobot applications, the systems may be unknown priorto designing the interface for potential human interaction. Thispresents a difficult goal for allowing multiple users to interactwith many possibly unknown systems. In this paper, we present aninteraction infrastructure aligned with providing this interface. Itoperates in two phases that accommodate both many-to-many interactionand generalized, one-to-one interaction between users and roboticsystems.

Title: Where should the person stop and the information search interface start
Abstract: Many users of online and other automated information systems want totake advantage ofthe speed and power of automated retrieval, while still controllingand directing the steps of thesearch themselves. They do not want the system to take over and carryout the search entirelyfor them. Yet the objective of much of current theory andexperimentation in informationretrieval systems and interfaces is to design systems in which theuser has either no or onlyreactive involvement with the search process. It is argued here thatthe advanced informationretrieval research community is missing an opportunity to designsystems that are in betterharmony with the actual preferences of many users--sophisticatedsystems that provide anoptimal combination of searcher control and system retrieval power.The user may be provided effective means of directing the search ifcapabilities specific tothe information retrieval process, that is, strategic behaviorsnormally associated withinformation searching, are incorporated into the interface. There aremany questions concerning1) the degree of user vs. system involvement in the search, and 2)the size, or chunking, ofactivities, that is, how much and what type of activity the usershould be able to direct thesystem to do at once. These two dimensions are analyzed and a numberof configurations ofsystem capability that combine user and system control are presentedand discussed. In theprocess, the concept of the information search stratagem isintroduced, and particular attentionis paid to the provision of strategic, as opposed to purelyprocedural capabilities for thesearcher.

Title: Developing a reflective model of collaborative systems
Abstract: Recent years have seen a shift in perception of the nature of HCI andinteractive systems. As interface workhas increasingly become a focus of attention for the social sciences,we have expanded our appreciation ofthe importance of issues such as work practice, adaptation andevolution in interactive systems.The reorientation in our view of interactive systems has beenaccompanied by a call for a new model ofdesign centred around user needs and participation. This paper arguesthat a new process of design is notenough, and that the new view necessitates a similar reorientation inthe structure of the systems we build.It outlines some requirements for systems which support a deeperconception of interaction, and argues thatthe traditional system design techniques are not suited to creatingsuch systems. Finally, using examplesfrom ongoing work in the design of an open toolkit for collaborativeapplications, it illustrates how the principlesof computational reflection and metaob...

Title: Design for Privacy in Ubiquitous Computing Environments
Abstract: : Current developments in information technology are leading toincreasing captureand storage of information about people and their activities. Thisraises serious issuesabout the preservation of privacy. In this paper we examine why theseissues are particularlyimportant in the introduction of ubiquitous computing technology intothe workingenvironment. Certain problems with privacy are closely related to theways in which thetechnology attenuates natural mechanisms of feedback and control overinformationreleased. We describe a framework for design for privacy inubiquitous computing environmentsand conclude with an example of its application.IntroductionInformation technology can store, transmit and manipulate vastquantities and varietiesof information. Whilst this is critical to government, publicservices, businessand many individuals, it may also facilitate unobtrusive access,manipulation andpresentation of personal data (Parker et al., 1990; Dunlop &Kling, 1991)....

Abstract: o spent a great deal of time as his first reader/tutor.Three years later, in 1982, he learned Braille. No Braille textbookswere available,however, so the only source of reading material was his own classnotes andnotes prepared from recordings made by his readers. He developed hisown systemfor writing math in Braille, since he could not locate the standardBraillemath-codes in India.One of his first uses of Braille was to mark a Rubik's cube. He hadsolved thefirst two layers of the cube by pointing to each square and havingsomeone tell himthe color, but the last layer was too difficult to solve in thismanner. So his brothercoded the cube colors in Braille. It took him four days to solve thecube the firsttime; later, he could solve it in under 30 seconds. Working with theBraille cubeyielded interesting insights. For example, he soon realized that onecolor shouldstay unmarked, since that was easiest to identify.

Title: Usability Analysis of Visual Programming Environments: A 'Cognitive Dimensions' Framework
Abstract: this paper we shall describe a less detailed approach, specificallyintended to be useful outside the specialist world of HCI. We haveapplied this `cognitive dimensions' framework to a selection ofdifferent enduser programming environments [1]. The frameworkdescribes about a dozen dimensions, or cognitivelyrelevant aspects,of a programming environment (or of any other kind of system). Formost people the concepts employed will be immediately recognizablebut will not have been named before; explicitly listing and namingthe dimensions gives designers a better chance to avoid oversightsand can improve the level of critical discourse by providing a sharedvocabulary. What determines usability? Glinert ([2], p. 170 ff) haselegantly stated the need for investigation of cognitive issuesrelated to programming environment design for non-textual languages.However, he distinguished only two cognitive aspects: ease oflearning and system understandability. These are important but quiteinsufficient. A programming language may be easy to learn and easy tounderstand, but its environment may make it unusable. Usability isdetermined by a whole complex of cognitive factors. Each of thevarious tasks that make up programming must be easy enough to do,including learning the language, creating the design, coding it,checking, modification, comprehension, and explanation. (There arealso many non-cognitive issues, some inter-personal and somearchitectural, that we shall not discuss.) Moreover, the particularcontext deter- 2

A HMD places the user inthe modeling space, making three dimensional relationshipsmore understandable. As a result, 3dm is easy to learn how touse and encourages experimentation with model shapes.1 IntroductionThe use of interactive 3D environments hasincreased the demand for complex 3D models.[9] The 3Denvironments that provide a sense of telepresence or "virtualreality" require a large number of models in order to give theuser the illusion of being in a specific place.

Title: Two-Handed Direct Manipulation on the Responsive Workbench
Abstract: We have built a system that allows users to naturally manipulatevirtual 3D models with both hands on the Responsive Workbench, atabletop VR device. Our design is largely based upon Guiard'sobservations of how humans distribute work between the two hands inthe real world. We show how to apply these principles for theworkbenchenvironment and describe many issues encountered during thedesign. We first develop a framework for two-handed interaction andthen explore a variety of two-handed 3D tools and interactivetechniques. Related issues include how constraints are implementedand controlled by the two hands and how transitions betweenone-handedandtwo-handed tasks occur seemlessly. Informal observationsof the system in practice show that users can perform navigation andmanipulation tasks easily and with little training using thetwo-handed environment. One of our interesting findings was thatusers often performed two-handed manipulations by combining twootherwise independent o...

Title: Declarative interface models for user interface construction tools: the MASTERMIND approach
Abstract: Currently, building a user interface involves creating a largeprocedural program. Modelbasedprogramming provides an alternative new paradigm. In the model-basedparadigm,developers create a declarative model that describes the tasks thatusers are expected toaccomplish with a system, the functional capabilities of a system,the style andrequirements of the interface, the characteristics and preferences ofthe users, and the I/Otechniques supported by the delivery platform. Based on the model, amuch smallerprocedural program then determines the behavior of the system.There are several advantages to this approach. The declarative modelis a commonrepresentation that tools can reason about, enabling the constructionof tools that automatevarious aspects of interface design, that assist system builders inthe creation of themodel, that automatically provide context sensitive help and otherrun-time assistance tousers.

Abstract: The creation of a complex web site is a thorny problem in userinterface design. In this paper we explore the notion of adaptive websites: sites that semi-automatically improve their organization andpresentation by learning from visitor access patterns. It is easy toimagine and implement web sites that offer shortcuts to popularpages. Are more sophisticated adaptive web sites feasible? Whatdegree of automation can we achieve? To address the questions above,we describe the design space of adaptive web sites and consider acase study: the problem of synthesizing new index pages thatfacilitate navigation of a web site. We present the PageGatheralgorithm, which automatically identifies candidate link sets toinclude in index pages based on user access logs.

Title: Eye tracking in advanced interface design
Abstract: INTRODUCTION The problem of human-computer interaction can be viewedas two powerful information processors (human and computer)attempting to communicate with each other via a narrowbandwidth,highly constrained interface [23]. To address it, we seek faster,more natural, and more convenient means for users and computers toexchange information. The user's side is constrained by the nature ofhuman communication organs and abilities; the computer's isconstrained only by input/output devices and interaction techniquesthat we can invent. Current technology has been stronger in thecomputer-to-user direction than user-to-computer, hence today'suser-computer dialogues are rather one-sided, with the bandwidth fromthe computer to the user far greater than that from user to computer.Using eye movements as a user-tocomputer communication medium canhelp redress this imbalance.

Abstract: A fundamental issue in user interface design is the effectiveuse of available screen space, commonly referred to asthe screen real estate problem. This paper presents a newdistortion-based viewing tool for exploring large informationspaces through the use of a three-dimensional pliable surface.Arbitrarily-shaped regions (foci) on the surface may be selectedand pulled towards or pushed away from the viewerthereby increasing or decreasing the level of detail containedwithin each region. Furthermore, multiple foci are smoothlyblended together such that there is no loss of context. Themanipulation and blending of foci is accomplished using afairly simple mathematical model based on gaussian curves.The significance of this approach is that it utilizes precognitiveperceptual cues about the three-dimensional surface tomake the distortions comprehensible, and allows the user tointeractively control the location, shape, and extent of thedistortion in very large graphs or maps....

From a game description, Gala creates anaugmented game tree with information sets whichcan be used by various algorithms in order to findoptimal strategies for that game. In particular, Galaimplements the first practical algorithm for findingoptimal randomized strategies in two-player imperfectinformation competitive games [Koller et al.,1994] .

These tasksappear frequently in 3D applications and are commonly broken downinto a series of sequential operations, each controlling fewerdegrees of freedom -- even though this may dramatically change thecharacter of the task. However, two-handed interaction, in theory,makes it possible to perform the same tasks using half the number ofsequential steps since two previously sequential operations can beperformed simultaneously. In addition, many forms of two-handedinteraction may be simpler to use and to understand since theycorrespond to common interactions in the physical world. It issignificant when ta...

Title: Hierarchically classifying documents using very few words
Abstract: The proliferation of topic hierarchies for text documents hasresulted in a need for tools that automatically classify newdocuments within such hierarchies. Existing classification schemeswhich ignore the hierarchical structure and treat the topics asseparate classes are often inadequate in text classification wherethe there is a large number of classes and a huge number of relevantfeatures needed to distinguish between them. We propose an approachthat utilizes the hierarchical topic structure to decompose theclassification task into a set of simpler problems, one at each nodein the classification tree. As we show, each of these smallerproblems can be solved accurately by focusing only on a very smallset of features, those relevant to the task at hand. This set ofrelevant features varies widely throughout the hierarchy, so that,while the overall relevant feature set may be large, each classifieronly examines a small subset. The use of reduced feature sets allowsus to util...

Links clearly contain highqualitysemantic clues that are lost upon a purely termbasedclassifier, but exploiting link information is non-trivialbecause it is noisy. Naive use of terms in the link neighborhoodof a document can even degrade accuracy. Ourcontribution is to propose robust statistical models and arelaxation labeling technique for better classification by exploitinglink information in a small neighborhood arounddocuments. Our technique also adapts gracefully to thefraction of neighboring documents having known topics. Weexperimented ...

Title: Information extraction as a basis for high-precision text classification
Abstract: this article.For the purpose of text classification, the answer keys serve only asa set ofcorrect classifications for each text. If a text has instantiated keytemplatesassociated with it in the corpus, then it should be classified as arelevant text.If a text has no instantiated key templates associated with it (i.e.,only adummy template) then it should be classified as an irrelevant text.This is abinary classification problem: a text is either relevant to theterrorismdomain or irrelevant. The texts were selected by keyword search fromadatabase of newswire articles 2 because they contained wordsassociated withterrorism. However, many of them did not mention any relevantterroristincidents. Of the 1700 texts in the MUC4 corpus, only 53% described arelevant terrorist event. Because many of the texts in the corpus were irrelevant, the MUC-4systems had to distinguish the relevant from the irrelevant texts.Althoughthe MUC-4 task was information extraction, information detection 4(i.e, textclassification) was an implicit subtask. To be successful in MUC-4,theinformation extraction systems also had to be good at detection. OurMUC-4system did not use a separate text classification module. Instead, weextractedinformation from every text and relied on a discourse analysis moduleto discard irrelevant templates. This strategy was very effective, 5but it wasexpensive.

Title: Information Extraction from HTML: Application of a General Machine Learning Approach
Abstract: Because the World Wide Web consists primarily oftext, information extraction is central to any effort thatwould use the Web as a resource for knowledge discovery.We show how information extraction can be castas a standard machine learning problem, and argue forthe suitability of relational learning in solving it. Theimplementation of a general-purpose relational learnerfor information extraction, SRV, is described. In contrastwith earlier learning systems for information extraction, SRV makes no assumptions about documentstructure and the kinds of information available for usein learning extraction patterns. Instead, structural andother information is supplied as input in the form of anextensible token-oriented feature set. We demonstratethe effectiveness of this approach by adapting SRV foruse in learning extraction rules for a domain consistingof university course and research project pages sampledfrom the Web. Making SRV Web-ready only involvesadding several simple...

Title: Feature Subset Selection Using A Genetic Algorithm
Abstract: : Practical pattern classification and knowledge discovery problemsrequire selection of a subset of attributes or features (from a muchlarger set) to represent the patterns to be classified. This is dueto the fact that the performance of the classifier (usually inducedby some learning algorithm) and the cost of classification aresensitive to the choice of the features used to construct theclassifier. Exhaustive evaluation of possible feature subsets isusually infeasible in practice because of the large amount ofcomputational effort required. Genetic algorithms, which belong to aclass of randomized heuristic search techniques, offer an attractiveapproach to find near-optimal solutions to such optimizationproblems. This paper presents an approach to feature subset selectionusing a genetic algorithm. Some advantages of this approach includethe ability to accommodate multiple criteria such as accuracy andcost of classification into the feature selection process and to findfe...

We present a theoreticalargument showing that, under common assumptions, unlabeled datacontain information about the target function. We then introduce analgorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled text based on thecombination of Expectation-Maximization with a naive Bayesclassifier.

We first show that AdaBoostsignificantly outperforms another highly effective text filteringalgorithm. We then compare AdaBoost and Rocchio over threelarge text filtering tasks. Overall both algorithms are comparableand are quite effective. AdaBoost produces better classifiersthan Rocchio when the training collection contains a very largenumber of relevant documents. However, on these tasks, Rocchioruns much faster than AdaBoost.1 IntroductionWith the explosion in the amount of information availableelectronically,information filtering systems that automatically sendarticles of potential interest to a user are becoming increasinglyimportant.

This paper shows that the accuracy of learned text classifiers canbe improved byaugmenting a small number of labeled training documents with a largepool of unlabeled documents.This is important because in many text classification problemsobtaining training labelsis expensive, while large quantities of unlabeled documents arereadily available.We introduce an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeleddocuments based on thecombination of Expectation-Maximization (EM) and a naive Bayesclassifier.

It then trains a new classifier using the labels for allthe documents, and iteratesto convergence. This basic EM procedure works well when the dataconform to the generativeassumptions of the model. However these assumptions are oftenviolated in practice, and poorperformance can result. We present two extensions to the algorithmthat improve ...

Abstract: Query expansion methods have been studied for a longtime - with debatable success in many instances. In thispaper we present a probabilistic query expansion modelbased on a similarity thesaurus which was constructedautomatically. A similarity thesaurus reflects domainknowledge about the particular collection from which itis constructed. We address the two important issueswith query expansion: the selection and the weighting ofadditional search terms. In contrast to earlier methods,our queries are expanded by adding those terms that aremost similar to the concept of the query, rather thanselecting terms that are similar to the query terms. Ourexperiments show that this kind of query expansionresults in a notable improvement in the retrievaleffectiveness when measured using both recall-precisionand usefulness.1.

In particular, for large learning tasks with manytraining examples, off-the-shelf optimization techniques for generalquadratic programs quickly become intractable in their memory andtime requirements.

We also demonstrate methods that reducethe amount of information archived from past judged documentswithout adversely affecting effectiveness. A novel simulationshows that such techniques are useful for handlinglong-standing queries with drifting notions of relevance.1 IntroductionAn information filter monitors a stream of documents andselects those that match a query.

However, we have foundthat recognizing singular and plural nouns, verb forms,negation, and prepositions can produce dramaticallydifferent text classification results. We present resultsfrom text classification experiments that compare relevancy signatures, which use local linguistic context,with corresponding indexing terms that do not. In twodifferent domains, relevancy signatures produced betterresults than the simple indexing terms. These experimentssuggest that stopword lists and stemming algorithmsmay remove or conflate many words that couldbe used to create more effective indexing terms.IntroductionMost information retrieval systems use a stopword list toprevent common words from being used as indexing terms.Highly frequent words, such as determiners and prepositions,are not considered to be content words because theyappear in virtually every document.

Title: Evaluating and Optimizing Autonomous Text Classification Systems
Abstract: Text retrieval systems typically produce a ranking of documents andlet a user decide how far down that ranking to go. In contrast,programs that filter text streams, software that categorizesdocuments, agents which alert users, and many other IR systems mustmake decisions without human input or supervision. It is important todefine what constitutes good effectiveness for these autonomoussystems, tune the systems to achieve the highest possibleeffectiveness, and estimate how the effectiveness changes as new datais processed. We show how to do this for binary text classificationsystems, emphasizing that different goals for the system lead todifferent optimal behaviors. Optimizing and estimating effectivenessis greatly aided if classifiers that explicitly estimate theprobability of class membership are used. 1 Introduction Rankedretrieval is the information retrieval (IR) researcher's favoritetool for dealing with information overload.

Abstract: In addressing the growing problem of junk E-mail onthe Internet, we examine methods for the automatedconstruction of filters to eliminate such unwanted messagesfrom a user's mail stream. By casting this problemin a decision theoretic framework, we are able tomake use of probabilistic learning methods in conjunctionwith a notion of differential misclassification costto produce filters which are especially appropriate forthe nuances of this task. While this may appear, atfirst, to be a straight-forward text classification problem,we show that by considering domain-specific featuresof this problem in addition to the raw text ofE-mail messages, we can produce much more accuratefilters. Finally, we show the efficacy of such filters in areal world usage scenario, arguing that this technologyis mature enough for deployment.IntroductionAs the number of users connected to the Internet continuesto skyrocket, electronic mail (E-mail) is quicklybecoming one of the fastest and m...

Title: Building and Maintaining Analysis-Level Class Hierarchies Using Galois Lattices
Abstract: Software reuse is one of the most advertised advantages ofobject-orientation. Inheritance, in all its forms, playsan important part in achieving greater reuse, at all stages ofdevelopment. Class hierarchies start taking shape at theanalysis level, where classes that share application-significant dataand application-meaningful external behavior aregrouped under more general classes. At the design level, suchhierarchies are augmented with implementation classes,and possibly reorganized to take into account implementation factorssuch as performance or code reuse [22]. Gettingthe analysis-level hierarchy "right" is very important forthe understandability and traceability of the models and thereusability of the resulting code [22]. In this paper, we propose aformal method that organizes a set of class interfacesinto a lattice structure called Galois Lattice [10].

Title: Automating the Construction of Internet Portals with Machine Learning
Abstract: . Internet portals are growing in popularity because they gathercontent from the Web and organize it for easy access, retrieval andsearch. For example, www.campsearch.com allows complex queries byage-group, size, location and cost over summer camps. Thisfunctionality is not possible with general, Web-wide search engines.Unfortunately these portals are difficult and time-consuming tomaintain. This paper proposes the use of machine learning techniquesto greatly automate the creation and maintenance of Internet portals.We describe new research in reinforcement learning, informationextraction and text classification that enables efficient spidering,the identification of informative text segments, and the populationof topic hierarchies. Using these techniques, we have built ademonstration system: a portal for computer science research papers.It already contains over 50,000 papers and is publicly available atwww.cora.justresearch.com.

Title: Concept indexing: A fast dimensionality reduction           algorithm with applications to document retrieval and             categorization
Abstract: In recent years, we have seen a tremendous growth in the volume oftext documents available on the Internet, digital libraries, newssources, and company-wide intranets. This has led to an increasedinterest in developing methods that can efficiently categorize andretrieve relevant information. Retrieval techniques based ondimensionality reduction, such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI),have been shown to improve the quality of the information beingretrieved by capturing the latent meaning of the words present in thedocuments. Unfortunately, the high computational requirements of LSIand its inability to compute an effective dimensionality reduction ina supervised setting limits its applicability. In this paper wepresent a fast dimensionality reduction algorithm, called conceptindexing (CI) that is equally effective for unsupervised andsupervised dimensionality reduction. CI computes a k-dimensionalrepresentation of a collection of documents by first clustering thedo...

Title: On the Learnability and Design of Output Codes for Multiclass Problems
Abstract: . Output coding is a general framework for solving multiclasscategorization problems. Previous research on output codes hasfocused on building multiclass machines given predefined outputcodes. In this paper we discuss for the first time the problem ofdesigning output codes for multiclass problems. For the designproblem of discrete codes, which have been used extensively inprevious works, we present mostly negative results. We then introducethe notion of continuous codes and cast the design problem ofcontinuous codes as a constrained optimization problem. We describethree optimization problems corresponding to three different norms ofthe code matrix. Interestingly, for the l 2 norm our formalismresults in a quadratic program whose dual does not depend on thelength of the code. A special case of our formalism provides amulticlass scheme for building support vector machines which can besolved efficiently. We give a time and space efficient algorithm forsolving the quadratic program. We describe preliminary experimentswith synthetic data show that our algorithm is often two orders ofmagnitude faster than standard quadratic programming packages. Weconclude with the generalization properties of the algorithm.Keywords: Multiclass categorization,output coding, SVM 1.

Title: Using Machine Learning to Improve Information Access
Abstract: The explosion of on-line information has given rise to manyquery-based search engines (such as Alta Vista) and manuallyconstructed topic hierarchies (such as Yahoo! ). But with the currentgrowth rate in the amount of information, query results growincomprehensibly large and manual classification in topic hierarchiescreates an immense information bottleneck. Therefore, these tools arerapidly becoming inadequate for addressing users' information needs.In this dissertation, we address these problems with a system fortopical information space navigation that combines the query-basedand taxonomic approaches. Our system, named SONIA (Service forOrganizing Networked Information Au- tonomously), is implemented aspart of the Stanford Digital Libraries testbed. It enables thecreation of dynamic hierarchical document categorizations based onthe full-text of articles. Using probability theory as a formalfoundation, we develop several Machine Learning methods to allowdocument collections to be automatically organized at a topicallevel. First, to generate such topical hierarchies, we employ a novelprobabilistic clustering scheme that outperforms traditional methodsused in both Information Retrieval and Probabilistic Reasoning.Furthermore, we develop methods for classifying new articles intosuch automatically generated, or existing manually generated,hierarchies. In contrast to standard classification approaches whichdo not make use of the taxonomic relations in a topic hierarchy, ourmethod explicitly uses the existing hierarchical relationshipsbetween topics, leading to improvements in classification accuracy.Much of this improvement is derived from the fact that theclassification decisions in such a hierarchy can be made byconsidering only the presence (o...

Title: Evaluating Text Categorization
Abstract: While certain standard procedures are widely used for evaluating textretrieval systems and algorithms, the same is not true for textcategorization. Omission of important data from reports is common andmethods of measuring effectiveness vary widely. This has made judgingthe relative merits of techniques for text categorization difficultand has disguised important research issues. In this paper I discussa variety of ways of evaluating the effectiveness of textcategorization systems, drawing both on reported categorizationexperiments and on methods used in evaluating query-driven retrieval.I also consider the extent to which the same evaluation methods maybe used with systems for text extraction, a more complex task. Inevaluating either kind of system, the purpose for which the output isto be used is crucial in choosing appropriate evaluation methods.INTRODUCTION Text classification systems, i.e. systems which can makedistinctions between meaningful classes of texts, have ...

Title: Combining Statistical and Relational Methods for Learning in Hypertext Domains
Abstract: . We present a new approach to learning hypertext classifiers thatcombines a statistical text-learning method with a relational rulelearner. This approach is well suited to learning in hypertextdomains because its statistical component allows it to characterizetext in terms of word frequencies, whereas its relational componentis able to describe how neighboring documents are related to eachother by hyperlinks that connect them. We evaluate our approach byapplying it to tasks that involve learning definitions for (i)classes of pages, (ii) particular relations that exist between pairsof pages, and (iii) locating a particular class of information in theinternal structure of pages. Our experiments demonstrate that thisnew approach is able to learn more accurate classifiers than eitherof its constituent methods alone. 1 Introduction In recent yearsthere has been a great deal of interest in applying machinelearningmethods to a variety of problems in classifying and extracting ...

Unlike techniques that rely on OCR output, our method isregion-based: segmentation qualityis assessed by comparing the segmentation output, described as a setof regions, to the correspondingground-truth. Error maps are used to keep track of all the errorsassociated with each pixel, regardless ofthe document complexity. Misclassifications, splitting, and mergingof regions are among the errorsdetected by the system. Each error can be weighted individually andthe system can be customized tobenchmark virtually any type of segmentation task. # 1998 PatternRecognition Society. Published byElsevier Science Ltd.

Title: Employing EM and pool-based active learning for text classification
Abstract: This paper shows how a text classifier's need for labeled trainingdocuments can be reduced by taking advantage of a large pool ofunlabeled documents. We modify the Query-by-Committee (QBC) method ofactive learning to use the unlabeled pool for explicitly estimatingdocument density when selecting examples for labeling. Then activelearning is combined with ExpectationMaximization in order to"fill in" the class labels of those documents that remainunlabeled. Experimental results show that the improvements to activelearning require less than two-thirds as many labeled trainingexamples as previous QBC approaches, and that the combination of EMand active learning requires only slightly more than half as manylabeled training examples to achieve the same accuracy as either theimproved active learning or EM alone.

Title: Joins that generalize: text classification using \sc Whirl
Abstract: WHIRL is an extension of relational databases that can perform"soft joins" based on the similarity of textualidentifiers; these soft joins extend the traditional operation ofjoining tables based on the equivalence of atomic values. This paperevaluates WHIRL on a number of inductive classification tasks usingdata from the World Wide Web. We show that although WHIRL is designedfor more general similaritybased reasoning tasks, it is competitivewith mature inductive classification systems on these classificationtasks. In particular, WHIRL generally achieves lower generalizationerror than C4.5, RIPPER, and several nearest-neighbor methods. WHIRLis also fast---up to 500 times faster than C4.5 on some benchmarkproblems. We also show that WHIRL can be efficiently used to selectfrom a large pool of unlabeled items those that can be classifiedcorrectly with high confidence.

Title: SPIRIT: Sequential Pattern Mining with Regular Expression Constraints
Abstract: Discovering sequential patterns is an important problem in datamining with a host of application domains including medicine,telecommunications, and the World Wide Web. Conventional miningsystems provide users with only a very restricted mechanism (based onminimum support) for specifying patterns of interest. In this paper,we propose the use of Regular Expressions (REs) as a flexibleconstraint specification tool that enables user-controlled focus tobe incorporated into the pattern mining process. We develop a familyof novel algorithms (termed SPIRIT -- Sequential Pattern mIning withRegular expressIon consTraints) for mining frequent sequentialpatterns that also satisfy user-specified RE constraints. The maindistinguishing factor among the proposed schemes is the degree towhich the RE constraints are enforced to prune the search space ofpatterns during computation. Our solutions provide valuable insightsinto the tradeoffs that arise when constraints that do not subscribeto...

Title: Estimating the Generalization Performance of a SVM Efficiently
Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes an approach to estimating thegeneralization performance of a support vector machine (SVM) for textclassification. Without any computation intensive resampling, the newestimators are computationally much more efficient thancross-validation or bootstrap, since they can be computed immediatelyfrom the form of the hypothesis returned by the SVM. Moreover, theestimators delevoped here address the special performance measuresneeded for text classification. While they can be used to estimateerror rate, one can also estimate the recall, the precision, and theF 1 . A theoretical analysis and experiments on three textclassification collections show that the new method can effectivelyestimate the performance of SVM text classifiers in a very efficientway.

Abstract: There is strong empirical and theoretic evidence that combination ofretrieval methods can improve performance. In this paper, wesystematically compare combination strategies in the context ofdocument filtering, using queries from the Tipster reference corpus.We find that simple averaging strategies do indeed improveperformance, but that direct averaging of probability estimates isnot the correct approach. Instead, the probability estimates must berenormalized using logistic regression on the known relevancejudgements. We examine more complex combination strategies but findthem less successful due to the high correlations among our filteringmethods which are optimized over the same training data and employsimilar document representations. 1 Introduction A text filteringsystem monitors an incoming document stream and selects documentsidentified as relevant to one or more of its query profiles.

Title: Role of Verbs in Document Analysis
Abstract: We present results of two methods for assessingthe event profile of news articles as a functionof verb type. The unique contribution of thisresearch is the focus on the role of verbs, ratherthan nouns. Two algorithms are presented andevaluated, one of which is shown to accuratelydiscriminate documents by type and semanticproperties, i.e. the event profile. The initialmethod, using WordNet (Miller et al. 1990),produced multiple cross-classification of articles,primarily due to the bushy nature of theverb tree coupled with the sense disambiguationproblem. Our second approach using EnglishVerb Classes and Alternations (EVCA) Levin(1993) showed that monosemous categorizationof the frequent verbs in WSJ made it possible tousefully discriminate documents. For example,our results show that articles in which communicationverbs predominate tend to be opinionpieces, whereas articles with a high percentageof agreement verbs tend to be about mergers orlegal cases.

Title: A Comparison of Classifiers and Document Representations for the Routing Problem
Abstract: In this paper, we compare learning techniques based on statisticalclassification to traditional methods of relevance feedback for thedocument routing problem. We consider three classification techniqueswhich have decision rules that are derived via explicit errorminimization: linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, andneural networks. We demonstrate that the classifiers perform 1015 %better than relevance feedback via Rocchio expansion for the TREC-2and TREC-3 routing tasks. Error minimization is difficult inhigh-dimensional feature spaces because the convergence process isslow and the models are prone to overfitting. We use two differentstrategies, latent semantic indexing and optimal term selection, toreduce the number of features. Our results indicate that featuresbased on latent semantic indexing are more effective for techniquessuch as linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression, whichhave no way to protect against overfitting.

In this paper weshow the results from using a hierarchy of self-organizingmaps to perform the text classification task. Each of the individualself-organizing maps is trained independently andgets specialized to a subset of the input data. As a consequence,the choice of this particular artificial neural networkmodel enables the true establishment of a document taxonomy.The benefit of this approach is a straightforward representationof document similarities combined with dramaticallyreduced training time. In particular, the hierarchicalrepresentation of document collections is appealing becauseit is the underlying organizational principle in use by librariansproviding the necessary familiarity...

Title: Text Categorization Using Weight Adjusted k -Nearest Neighbor Classification
Abstract: Text categorization is the task of deciding whether a documentbelongs to a set of prespecified classes of documents.Automatic classification schemes can greatly facilitate the processof categorization. Categorization ofdocuments is challenging, as the number of discriminating words canbe very large. Many existing algorithms simplywould not work with these many number of features. k-nearest neighbor(k-NN) classification is an instance-basedlearning algorithm that has shown to be very effective for a varietyof problem domains including documents. Thekey element of this scheme is the availability of a similaritymeasure that is capable of identifying neighbors of a particulardocument. A major drawback of the similarity measure used in k-NN isthat it uses all features in computingdistances. In many document data sets, only smaller number of thetotal vocabulary may be useful in categorizingdocuments. A possible approach to overcome this problem is to learnweights for differe...

Afiltering system, SIFTER, has been implemented based on the model,using established techniques in information retrieval and artificialintelligence. These techniques include document representation by avector-space model, document classification by unsupervised learning,and user modeling by reinforcement learning. The system can filterinformation based on content and a user's specific interests. Theuser's interests are automatically learned with only limited userintervention in the form of optional relevance feedback fordocuments.

The only requirementour co-training strategy places on each supervisedlearning algorithm is that its hypothesispartitions the example space into a set ofequivalence classes (e.g. for a decision treeeach leaf defines an equivalence class).

Title: Document clustering using word clusters via the information bottleneck method
Abstract: We present a novel implementation of the recently introducedinformation bottleneck method for unsupervised document clustering.Given a joint empirical distribution of words and documents, p(x; y),we first cluster the words, Y , so that the obtained word clusters,Y_hat , maximally preserve the information on the documents. Theresulting joint distribution, p(X; Y_hat ), contains most of theoriginal information about the documents, I(X; Y_hat ) ~= I(X;Y ),but it is much less sparse and noisy. Using the same procedure wethen cluster the documents, X , so that the information about theword-clusters is preserved. Thus, we first find word-clusters thatcapture most of the mutual information about the set of documents,and then find document clusters, that preserve the information aboutthe word clusters. We tested this procedure over several documentcollections based on subsets taken from the standard 20Newsgroupscorpus. The results were assessed by calculating the correlationbetween the document clusters and the correct labels for thesedocuments. Finding from our experiments show that this doubleclustering procedure, which uses the information bottleneck method,yields significantly superior performance compared to other commondocument distributional clustering algorithms. Moreover, the doubleclustering procedure improves all the distributional clusteringmethods examined here.

Abstract: Hypertext poses new research challenges for text classification.Hyperlinks, HTMLtags, category labels distributed over linked documents, and metadata extractedfrom related Web sites all provide rich information for classifyinghypertext documents.How to appropriately represent that information and automaticallylearnstatistical patterns for solving hypertext classification problems isan open question.This paper seeks a principled approach to providing the answers.Specifically, wedefine five hypertext regularities which may (or may not) hold in aparticular applicationdomain, and whose presence (or absence) may significantly influencetheoptimal design of a classifier. Using three hypertext datasets andthree well-knownlearning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbor, and First OrderInductiveLearner), we examine these regularities in different domains, andcompare alternativeways to exploit them. Our results show that the identification ofhypertextregularities in the data and the selection of appropriaterepresentations for hypertextin particular domains are crucial, but seldom obvious, in real-worldproblems.We find that adding the words in the linked neighborhood to the pagehaving thoselinks (both inlinks and outlinks) were helpful for all ourclassifiers on one data set,but more harmful than helpful for two out of the three classifiers onthe remainingdatasets. We also observed that extracting meta data from related Websites wasextremely useful for improving classification accuracy in some ofthose domains. Finally,the relative performance of the classifiers being tested providedinsights intotheir strengths and limitations for solving classification problemsinvolving diverseand often noisy Web pages.

Title: An Environment for Morphosyntactic Processing of Unrestricted Spanish Text
Abstract: We present in this paper a fast, broad-coverage, accuratemorphological analyzer for Spanish words, MACO+, which is an extendedand improved version of that described in (Acebo et al., 1994). Theearlier version had two main flaws: it was not transportable, and itwas too slow to enable massive text processing. The presented systemnot only overcomes those two flaws, but also offers improved coverageand accuracy. We also present two general part-of-speech taggers,which can be used to disambiguate the output of the morphologicalanalyzer. All modules run in any Unix/Linux machine as a pipelineprocess and they may also be used inside the GATE environment for NLP(Cunningham et al., 1996). The system is currently being used toannotate the LexEsp corpus, a 5.5 million word corpus of Spanish, ina bootstrapping refining procedure. Initial evaluation and resultsare reported.

Abstract: With the proliferation of electronic mail in the modern era, itbecomes ever moreimportant to devise methods for the organization, categorization andsearching of suchmail. Mail filtering is such a method for the organization ofincoming e-mail. In thispaper, we critique modern mail filters and describe how MachineLearning techniquescould improve upon them without eliminating the benefits theyprovide. We thenpresent ifile, a mail filter which makes use of the textclassification algorithm naiveBayes. Furthermore, we present experiments showing its classificationperformance onsets of private e-mail and point out some of the issues involved withcreating a MachineLearning based mail filter. We conclude that ifile eliminates some ofthe problems withmodern mail filters while still maintaining high classificationaccuracy.1 IntroductionMost modern mail clients allow the user to organize his or her mailinto what are called foldersor mailboxes.

In this paper weformalize feature selection specifically from adiscriminative perspective of improving classification/regression accuracy. The featureselection method is developed as an extensionto the recently proposed maximum entropydiscrimination (MED) framework. We describeMED as a flexible (Bayesian) regularization approach that subsumes, e.g., supportvector classification, regression and exponentialfamily models. For brevity, we restrictourselves primarily to feature selection inthe context of linear classification/regressionmethods and demonstrate that the proposedapproach indeed carries substantial improvementsin practice. Moreover, we discuss anddevelop various extensions of feature selection,including the problem of dealing withexample specific but unobserved degrees offreedom -- alignments or invariants.1 IntroductionRob...

Title: The Well-Founded Semantics for General Logic Programs
Abstract: A general logic program (abbreviated to "program"hereafter) is a set of rules that have both positive and negativesubgoals. It is common to view a deductive database as a generallogic program consisting of rules (IDB) sitting above elementaryrelations (EDB, facts). It is desirable to associate one Herbrandmodel with a program and think of that model as the "meaning ofthe program," or its "declarative semantics." Ideally,queries directed to the program would be answered in accordance withthis model. Recent research indicates that some programs do not havea "satisfactory" total model; for such programs, thequestion of an appropriate partial model arises. We introduceunfounded sets and well-founded partial models, and define thewell-founded semantics of a program to be its well-founded partialmodel. If the well-founded partial model is in fact a total model, wecall it the well-founded model. We show that the class of programspossessing a total well-founded model properly in...

Title: A Framework for Defining Logics
Abstract: The Edinburgh Logical Framework (LF) provides a means to define (orpresent) logics. It is based on a general treatment of syntax, rules,and proofs by means of a typed -calculus with dependent types. Syntaxis treated in a style similar to, but more general than, Martin-Löf'ssystem of arities. The treatment of rules and proofs focuses on hisnotion of a judgement. Logics are represented in LF via a newprinciple, the judgements as types principle, whereby each judgementis identified with the type of its proofs. This allows for a smoothtreatment of discharge and variable occurrence conditions and leadsto a uniform treatment of rules and proofs whereby rules are viewedas proofs of higher-order judgements and proof checking is reduced totype checking. The practical benefit of our treatment of formalsystems is that logic-indep endent tools such as proof editors andproof checkers can be constructed.

In a sense, F-logic stands in the samerelationship to the objectorientedparadigm as classical predicate calculus stands to relationalprogramming. F-logic has amodel-theoretic semantics and a sound and complete resolution-basedproof theory. A small numberof fundamental concepts that come from object-oriented programminghave direct representation inF-logic; other, secondary aspects of this paradigm are easily modeledas well.

Title: Radiosity and Realistic Image Synthesis
Abstract: this paper, such as the global distribution of radiative energy inthe tree crowns, which affects the amount of light reaching theleaves and the local temperature of plant organs. The presentedframework itself is also open to further research. To begin, theprecise functional specification of the environment, implied by thedesign of the modeling framework, is suitable for a formal analysisof algorithms that capture various environmental processes. Thisanalysis may highlight tradeoffs between time, memory, andcommunication complexity, and lead to programs matching the needs ofthe model to available system resources in an optimal manner. Adeeper understanding of the spectrum of processes taking place in theenvironment may lead to the design of a mini-language for environmentspecification. Analogous to the language of L-systems for plantspecification, this mini-language would simplify the modeling ofvarious environments, relieving the modeler from the burden oflow-level programming in a general-purpose language. Fleischer andBarr's work on the specification of environments supportingcollisions and reaction-diffusion processes [20] is an inspiring stepin this direction. Complexity issues are not limited to theenvironment, but also arise in plant models. They become particularlyrelevant as the scope of modeling increases from individual plants togroups of plants and, eventually, entire plant communities. Thisraises the problem of selecting the proper level of abstraction fordesigning plant models, including careful selection of physiologicalprocesses incorporated into the model and the spatial resolution ofthe resulting structures. The complexity of the modeling task can bealso addressed at the level of system design, by assigning variouscomponents o...

Title: A Calculus for Access Control in Distributed Systems
Abstract: This paper is a study of some of the concepts, protocols, andalgorithms for security in distributed systems, with a focus onaccess control. Our treatment is fairly formal, as it is based onlogics. Our main goal is to isolate some useful and mathematicallytractable concepts. We account for how a principal may come tobelieve that another principal is making a request, either on his ownor on someone else's behalf. We also provide a logical language foraccess control lists (ACLs) and theories for deciding whetherrequests should be granted. The logic enables us to explain a varietyof protocols which can differ from one another in subtle butimportant ways. On occasion, the formal analysis has suggested ideasfor implementations, for example that some digital signatures couldbe saved. Moreover, logics make it possible to describe protocols andpolicies at a reasonable level of abstraction; we avoid the need forad hoc arguments about particular implementations. This abstractionis important in the context of heterogeneous distributedenvironments, where several implementations of a design may coexist.Our study is intended as a formal basis for parts of a securityarchitecture, and for the Digital Distributed Systems SecurityArchitecture (DSSA) in particular [11]; this architecture iscurrently under implementation. Other formal explanations of securityare conceivable. We hope that this work clarifies some of the issuesthat these alternative accounts may address. The next section is anoverview. We describe the basic logical framework in Section 3.Sections 4 and 5 extend the treatment with roles and delegation.Then, in Section 6, we consider delegation schemes and algorithms formaking access control decisions.

Its design andimplementation are tailored towards the language designer who wantsto develop new languages as well as implement existing ones in ahighly interactive manner. It emphasizes compactness of syntaxdefinitions by offering (a) a standard interface between lexical andcontext-free syntax; (b) a standard correspondence betweencontext-free and abstract syntax; (c) powerful disambiguation andlist constructs; and (d) an efficient incremental implementationwhich accepts arbitrary context-free syntax definitions.

Title: A Needed Narrowing Strategy
Abstract: The narrowing relation over terms constitutes the basis of the mostimportant operational semantics of languages that integratefunctional and logic programming paradigms. It also plays animportant role in the definition of some algorithms of unificationmodulo equational theories which are defined by confluent termrewriting systems. Due to the inefficiency of simple narrowing, manyrefined narrowing strategies have been proposed in the last decade.This paper presents a new narrowing strategy which is optimal inseveral respects. For this purpose we propose a notion of a needednarrowing step that, for inductively sequential rewrite systems,extends the Huet and Lévy notion of a needed reduction step. Wedefine a strategy, based on this notion, that computes only needednarrowing steps. Our strategy is sound and complete for a large classof rewrite systems, is optimal w.r.t. the cost measure that countsthe number of distinct steps of a derivation, computes onlyincomparable and disjoint unifiers, and is efficiently implemented byunification.

Title: Modelling concurrency with partial orders
Abstract: Concurrency has been expressed variously in terms of formal languages(typically viathe shuffle operator), partial orders, and temporal logic, interalia. In this paper we extractfrom these three approaches a single hybrid approach having a richlanguage that mixesalgebra and logic and having a natural class of models of concurrentprocesses. The heartof the approach is a notion of partial string derived from the viewof a string as a linearlyordered multiset by relaxing the linearity constraint, therebypermitting partially orderedmultisets or pomsets. Just as sets of strings form languages, so dosets of pomsets formprocesses. We introduce a number of operations useful for specifyingconcurrent processesand demonstrate their utility on some basic examples. Although noneof the operationsis particularly oriented to nets it is nevertheless possible to usethem to express processesconstructed as a net of subprocesses, and more generally as a systemconsisting of components.Th...

Furthermore, noting thatrelational queries exhibit severalforms of genericity, we establish a number of collapse results of thefollowing form: The classof generic boolean queries expressible in the relational calculusaugmented with a given class ofconstraints coincides with the class of queries expressible in therelational calculus (with or withoutan order relation). We prove such results for both the natural andactive-domain semantics. Asa consequence, the relational calculus augmented with polynomialinequalities expresses the sameclasses of generic boolean queries under both the natural andactive-domain semantics.

Formalisms forrepresenting topological and other spatial information (e.g. [2] [10][11]) have generally employed the 1st-order predicate calculus.Whilst this language is much more expressive than 0-order(propositional) calculi it is correspondingly harder to reason with.Hence, by encoding spatial relationships in a propositionalrepresentation automated reasoning becomes more effective. I specifyrepresentations in both classical and intuitionistic propositionallogic, which --- together with well-defined meta-level reasoningalgorithms --- provide for efficient reasoning about a large class ofspatial relations. 1 INTRODUCTION This work has developed out ofresearch done by Randell, Cui and Cohn (henceforth RCC) onformalising spatial and temporal concepts used in describing physicalsituations [11].

In particular, weshow that with the most basic forms of abduction the relevantdecision problems are complete for complexity classes at the secondlevel of the polynomial hierarchy, while the use of prioritizationraises the complexity to the third level in certain cases.

We show how these rules can be incorporatedinto an anytime deduction procedure that proceeds by computingincreasingly narrow probability intervals that contain the tightestentailed probability interval. Since the procedure can be stopped atany time to yield partial information concerning the probabilityrange of any entailed sentence, one can make a tradeoff betweenprecision and computation time.

They range from resolution in Cstyle to originalkinds of resolution suggested by the declarative natureof the language. We show connections to view specificationand a further extension allowing runtime derivation of theclass hierarchy.

Title: A Schema Theorem for Context-Free Grammars
Abstract: The basic Schema Theorem for genetic algorithms is modified for agrammatically-basedlearning system. A context-free grammar is used to define a languagein which each sentenceis mapped to a fitness value. The derivation trees associated withthese sentences are used todefine the structure of schemata. The effect of crossover andmutation on schemata is described.A schema theorem is developed which describes how sentences of alanguage are propagatedduring evolution.1. IntroductionThe Schema Theorem for genetic algorithms (GA)[3] defines how useful structures in a populationof strings are propagated during the evolution of asolution. It gives a lower bound on the propagationof schemata from one generation to the next. AGA uses a fitness function to evaluate the population,and the genetic operations of crossover andmutation to search for new strings.The fixed-length nature of GA's has been extendedwith genetic programming (GP) [4], whichuses a tree-based representati...

Title: Mellin transforms and asymptotics: Harmonic sums
Abstract: . This survey presents a unified and essentially self-containedapproach to the asymptotic analysis of a large class of sums thatarise in combinatorial mathematics, discrete probabilistic models,and the average-case analysis of algorithms. It relies on the Mellintransform, a close relative of the integral transforms of Laplace andFourier. The method applies to harmonic sums that are superpositionsof rather arbitrary "harmonics" of a common base function.Its principle is a precise correspondence between individual terms inthe asymptotic expansion of an original function and singularities ofthe transformed function. The main applications are in the area ofdigital data structures, probabilistic algorithms, and communicationtheory. Die Theorie der reziproken Funktionen und Integrale ist eincentrales Gebiet, welches manche anderen Gebiete der Analysismiteinander verbindet. --- Hjalmar Mellin Introduction Hjalmar Mellin(1854--1933, see [59] for a summary of his works) gave his ...

Title: Parametric Shape Analysis via 3--Valued Logic
Abstract: We present a family of abstract-interpretation algorithms that arecapable of determining "shape invariants" of programs thatperform destructive updating on dynamically allocated storage. Themain idea is to represent the stores that can possibly arise duringexecution using three-valued logical structures. Questions aboutproperties of stores can be answered by evaluating predicate-logicformulae using Kleene's semantics of three-valued logic: -- If aformula evaluates to true, then the formula holds in every storerepresented by the three-valued structure. -- If a formula evaluatesto false, then the formula does not hold in any store represented bythe three-valued structure. -- If a formula evaluates to unknown,then we do not know if this formula holds in every store, in somestore, or in no store represented by the three-valued structure.Three-valued logical structures are thus a conservativerepresentation of memory stores. The approach described is aparametric framework...

Title: Extraction of Rules from Discrete-Time Recurrent Neural Networks
Abstract: The extraction of symbolic knowledge from trained neural networks andthe direct encoding of (partial) knowledge into networks prior totraining are important issues. They allow the exchange of informationbetween symbolic and connectionist knowledge representations. Thefocus of this paper is on the quality of the rules that are extractedfrom recurrent neural networks. Discrete-time recurrent neuralnetworks can be trained to correctly classify strings of a regularlanguage. Rules defining the learned grammar can be extracted fromnetworks in the form of deterministic finite-state automata (DFA's)by applying clustering algorithms in the output space of recurrentstate neurons. Our algorithm can extract different finite-stateautomata that are consistent with a training set from the samenetwork. We compare the generalization performances of thesedifferent models and the trained network and we introduce a heuristicthat permits us to choose among the consistent DFA's the modelwhich...

Title: Process and Policy: Resource-Bounded Nondemonstrative Reasoning
Abstract: This paper investigates the appropriateness of formal dialectics as abasis for non-monotonic reasoning and defeasible reasoning that takescomputational limits seriously. Rules that can come into conflictshould be regarded as policies, which are inputs to deliberativeprocesses. Dialectical protocols are appropriate for suchdeliberations when resources are bounded and search is serial. AI, itis claimed here, is now perfectly positioned to correct manymisconceptions about reasoning that have resulted from mathematicallogic's enormous success in this century: among them, (1) that allreasons are demonstrative, (2) that rational belief is constrained,not constructed, (3) that process and disputation are not essentialto reasoning. AI mainly provides new impetus to formalize thealternative (but older) conception of reasoning, and AI providesmechanisms with which to create compelling formalism that describesthe control of processes. The technical contributions here are: thepartial justification of dialectic based on controlling search; theobservation that non-monotonic reasoning can be subsumed undercertain kinds of dialectics; the portrayal of inference in knowledgebases as policy reasoning; the review of logics of dialogue andproposed extensions; and the pre-formal and initial formal discussionof aspects and variations of dialectical systems withnon-demonstrative reasons. 1.

Title: Constructing deterministic finite-state automata in sparse recurrent neural networks
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks that are trained to behave likedeterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) can show deterioratingperformance when tested on long strings. This deterioratingperformance can be attributed to the instability of the internalrepresentation of the learned DFA states. The use of a sigmoidaldiscriminant function together with the recurrent structurecontribute to this instability. We prove that a simple algorithm canconstruct second-order recurrent neural networks with a sparseinterconnection topology and sigmoidal discriminant function suchthat the internal DFA state representations are stable, i.e. theconstructed network correctly classifies strings of arbitrary length.The algorithm is based on encoding strengths of weights directly intothe neural network. We derive a relationship between the weightstrength and the number of DFA states for robust stringclassification. For a DFA with n states and m input alphabet symbols,the constructive algorithm genera...

Title: Action logic and pure induction
Abstract: In Floyd-Hoare logic, programs are dynamic while assertions arestatic (hold at states). In actionlogic the two notions become one, with programs viewed as on-the-flyassertions whose truth is evaluatedalong intervals instead of at states. Action logic is an equationaltheory ACT conservatively extendingthe equational theory REG of regular expressions with operationspreimplication a!b (had a then b) andpostimplication b/a (b if-ever a). Unlike REG, ACT is finitely based,makes areflexive transitive closure,and has an equivalent Hilbert system. The crucial axiom is that ofpure induction, (a!a)= a!a.This work was supported by the National Science Foundation undergrant number CCR-8814921.1 IntroductionMany logics of action have been proposed, most of them in the pasttwo decades.

Title: A multiple-method knowledge-acquisition shell for the automatic generation    of knowledge-acquisition tools
Abstract: The use of predefined models of problem-solving methods is receivingconsiderable attention from researchers in thearea of knowledge acquisition. Using these models, developers ofknowledge-acquisition tools are able to prescribe theroles in which knowledge is used in completing a given task. A numberof method-oriented architectures based on asingle problem-solving method have been developed by various researchgroups. Because the methods aredomain-independent, method-oriented architectures are limited by thefact that knowledge roles that depend ondomain-specific considerations cannot be represented using the modelof problem solving. In addition, the interfacebetween the knowledge-acquisition tool and the application expertcannot adequately convey the role of eachknowledge type in the task model. PROTG-II is a knowledge-acquisitionshell that we are building to generateknowledge-acquisition tools automatically without presupposing aspecific model of problem-solving. The sh...

Title: Two-Dimensional Languages
Abstract: this paper, much work have been done in studying properties ofpicture languages recognizedby finite-state machines and several other models have been designed.A survey on this subject canbe found in [21]. An intersting model of two-dimensional tapeacceptor is the two-dimensional on-linetessellation automaton introduced by K. Inoue and A. Nakamura in[18]. This is defined as an infinitetwo-dimensional array of identical conventional finite-state automataand it is a special type of cellularautomaton. Despite it is not evident that it is a generalization of aone-dimensional model, it can be easily2identified to a conventional automaton when restricted to one-row (orone-column) pictures. Moreover,the family of picture languages recognized by this model of automatonsatisfy many important properties.Different systems to generate pictures using grammars have been alsoexplored (cf. [31, 32, 33, 35, 34,36, 29, 30, 39]). However, in the finite state case, this approach isshown to be less powerful than others.Another possible generalization is to describe picture languages bylogic formulas. Recently, W. Thomasgave a general formalism to describe graphs (and, in particular,pictures) as model theoretical structuresand showed as "recognizability" corresponds to the notionsof definability on existential monadic secondorder logic (cf. [38]). This is coherent with the string languagerecognizability theory where Buchi'sTheorem holds.In a recent proposal (cf. [13, 14]) a notion of recognizability of aset of pictures in terms of tilingsystems is introduced. The underlying idea is to definerecognizability by "projection of local properties".Informally, recognition in a tiling system is defined in terms of afinite set of square pictures of side twowhich c...

Title: An algorithm for approximate tandem repeats
Abstract: A perfect single tandem repeat is de#ned as a nonempty string thatcan be divided into twoidentical substrings, e.g., abcabc. An approximate single tandemrepeat is one in which thesubstrings are similar, but not identical, e.g., abcdaacd. In thispaper we consider two criterionsof similarity: the Hamming distance (k mismatches) and the editdistance (k differences). For a string S of length n and an integer k our algorithm reportsall locally optimalapproximate repeats, r uu, for which the Hamming distance of u and uis at most k, inO (nk log(n/ k)) time, or all those for which the edit distance of uand u is at most k , inO (nk log k log(n/ k)) time. This paper concentrates on a moregeneral type of repeat calledmultiple tandem repeats. A multiple tandem repeat in a sequence S isa (periodic) substringr of S of the form r uu , where u is a pre#x of r and u is a pre#x of u. An approximate multiple tandem repeat is a multiple repeat with errors; therepeated subsequencesare similar but not identical. We precisely de#ne approximatemultiple repeats, and presentan algorithm that #nds all repeats that concur with our de#nition.The time complexity ofthe algorithm, when searching for repeats with up to k errors in astring S of length n,is O (nka log(n/ k)) where a is the maximum number of periods in anyreported repeat.We present some experimental results concerning the performance andsensitivity of ouralgorithm. The problem of #nding repeats within a string is acomputational problem withimportant applications in the #eld of molecular biology. Both exactand inexact repeats occurfrequently in the genome, and certain repeats occurring in the genomeare known to berelated to diseases in the human.

Furthermore, general but efficientalgorithms can used for combining information sources in actualrecognizers and for optimizing their application. In particular, asingle composition algorithm is used both to combine in advanceinformation sources such as language models and dictionaries, and tocombine acoustic observations and information sources dynamicallyduring recognition. 1 Introduction Many problems in speech processingcan be usefully analyzed in terms of the "noisy channel"metaphor: given an observation sequence o, find which intendedmessage w is most likely to generate that observation sequence bymaximizing P (w; ...

We also reason about the implementation itself,say to know itis correct; this is done in a programming logic. How do all theselogics relate? Thispaper considers that question and more.We show that by taking the view that the metalogic is primary, theseother partsare related in standard ways. The metalogic should be suitably richso that the objectlogic can be presented as an abstract data type, and it must besuitably computational(or constructive) so that an instance of that type is animplementation.

Title: Continuation-Based Partial Evaluation
Abstract: Partial evaluation aims at specializing programs; it is based on callunfolding, constant propagation, and constant folding along thecontrol and data flows of a source program. A continuation representscontrol during the execution of a program. Continuation-based partialevaluation improves partial evaluation by enhancing the staticcontrol flow of the source program. An offline partial evaluator isstaged into binding-time analysis and program specialization. Thebinding-time analysis classifies source expressions to be static ordynamic. Program specialization amounts to reducing the staticexpressions and reconstructing the dynamic expressions to form theresidual program. In this context, a control-based binding-timeimprovement affects both the binding-time analysis and thecorresponding specializer. We address continuation-basedspecialization for Gomard and Jones's offline partial evaluator -Mix. We integrate a control-based binding-time improvement into-Mix's binding-time ...

Abstract: Object-oriented computing is influencing many areas of computerscience, including database systems. Despite many advances,object-oriented computing is still in its infancy and a universallyaccepted definition of an object-oriented model is virtuallynonexistent. In this thesis, the object model, meta-model, querymodel, dynamic schema evolution policies, and version control of theTIGUKAT objectbase management system are presented. An identifyingcharacteristic of this system is that all components are uniformlymodeled as objects with well-defined behavior. This is an importantachievement towards advancing database technology because it unifiesthe components of a database within a single, clean, underlyingsemantics that can be easily extended to support other databaseservices. The TIGUKAT object model is purely behavioral , supportsfull encapsulation of objects, defines a clear separation betweenprimitive components, and incorporates a uniform semantics overobjects.

Title: Probabilistic Predicate Transformers
Abstract: this paper is to link Kozen's and He's models --- we show that therelations of He provide a more general operational semanticsunderlying the predicate transformers of Kozen, leading in particularto a simple treatment of non-determinism and probability together. Inthe standard case such a link generates `healthiness'(well-formedness) conditions for predicate transformers --- theycharacterise collectively the images of relational programs in thericher predicate-transformer space: strictness, monotonicity,positive conjunctivity and continuity. In the probabilistic case, weare able to to formulate and prove probabilistic healthinessconditions that generalise the standard ones. The presentation is asfollows: in Section 6 we introduce the correspondence between He'sand Kozen's models; in Section 7 we propose probabilistic healthinessconditions; in Section 8 we show that those conditions characterise`real' programs exactly; and in Section 9 we extend Kozen's work toinclude non-determinism. Section 10 discusses probabilistictermination, and recursion. Earlier sections summarise He's andKozen's approaches, on which our work is based; and example programsare given in Sections 2, 4, 9, 10 and 11.

Title: Revisiting the Edge of Chaos: Evolving Cellular Automata to Perform Computations
Abstract: We present results from an experiment similar to one performed byPackard [24], in which a genetic algorithm is used to evolve cellularautomata (CA) to perform a particular computational task. Packardexamined the frequency of evolved CA rules as a function of Langton'sparameter [17], and interpreted the results of his experiment asgiving evidence for the following two hypotheses: (1) CA rules ableto perform complex computations are most likely to be found near"critical" values, which have been claimed to correlatewith a phase transition between ordered and chaotic behavioralregimes for CA; (2) When CA rules are evolved to perform a complexcomputation, evolution will tend to select rules with values close tothe critical values. Our experiment produced very different results,and we suggest that the interpretation of the original results is notcorrect. We also review and discuss issues related to ,dynamical-behavior classes, and computation in CA. The mainconstructive re...

We then extend this result in two directions,by incorporating circular strings and by using infinite, but regular,sets of splicing rules. Section 1. Introduction In [3] and [4] TomHead introduced an operation on strings called splicing,. The basicidea is that two strings are cut at specified substrings, calledsites, and the first segment of one is reattached to the secondsegment of the other with the sites suitably modified.

To support this, we used classicallogic to represent partial specifications and to identifyinconsistenciesbetween them. We now present an adaptation of classical logic, whichwe term quasi-classical (QC) logic, that allows continued reasoningin thepresence of inconsistency. The adaptation is a weakening of classicallogicthat prohibits all trivial derivations, but still allows allresolvants ofthe assumptions to be derived. Furthermore, the connectives behave inaclassical manner. We then present a development called labelled QClogicthat records and tracks assumptions used in reasoning. Thisfacilitates alogical analysis of inconsistent information. We discuss theapplication oflabelled QC logic in the analysis of multi-perspectivespecifications.

Title: A comparison of languages which operationalize and formalize KADS models of expertise
Abstract: In the field of Knowledge Engineering, dissatisfaction with therapid­prototyping approach has led to a number of more principledmethodologies for the construction of knowledge­ based systems.Instead of immediately implementing the gathered and interpretedknowledge in a given implementation formalism according to therapid­prototyping approach, many such methodologies centre around thenotion of a conceptual model: an abstract, implementation independentdescription of the relevant problem solving expertise. A conceptualmodel should describe the task which is solved by the system and theknowledge which is required by it. Although such conceptual modelshave often been formulated in an informal way, recent years have seenthe advent of formal and operational languages to describe suchconceptual models more precisely, and operationally as a means formodel evaluation. In this paper, we study a number of such formal andoperational languages for specifying conceptual models. In order toenable a meaningful comparison of such languages, we focus onlanguages which are all aimed at the same underlying conceptualmodel, namely that from the KADS method for building KBS. We describeeight formal languages for KADS models of expertise, and comparethese languages with respect to their modelling primitives, theirsemantics, their implementations and their applications. Futureresearch issues in the area of formal and operational specificationlanguages for KBS are identified as the result of studying theselanguages. The paper also contains an extensive bibliography ofresearch in this area.

We show how thedevelopment and implementation of an explicit account of a sharedunderstanding (i.e. an `ontology') in a given subject area, canimprove such communication, which in turn, can give rise to greaterreuse and sharing, inter-operability, and more reliable software.After motivating their need, we clarify just what ontologies are andwhat purposes they serve. We outline a methodology for developing andevaluating ontologies, first discussing informal techniques,concerning such issues as scoping, handling ambiguity, reachingagreement and producing definitions. We then consider the benefits ofand describe, a more formal approach. We re-visit the scoping phase,and discuss the role of formal languages and techniques in thespecification, implementation and evaluation of ontologies. Finally,we review the state of the art and practice in this emerging field,considering various case studies, software tools for ontologydevelopment, key reearch issues and future prospects.

In recent years, a number of differentsemantics for defaults have been proposed, such as preferentialstructures, ffl-semantics, possibilistic structures, and -rankings,that have been shown to be characterized by the same set of axioms,known as the KLM properties. While this was viewed as a surprise, weshow here that it is almost inevitable. In the framework ofplausibility measures, we can give a necessary condition for the KLMaxioms to be sound, and an additional condition necessary andsufficient to ensure that the KLM axioms are complete. Thisadditional condition is so weak that it is almost always met wheneverthe axioms are sound. In particular, it is easily seen to hold forall the proposals made in the literature.

Title: Polymorphism and Type Inference in Database Programming
Abstract: In order to find a static type system that adequately supportsdatabase languages, we need to express the most general type of aprogram that involves database operations. This can be achievedthrough an extension to the type system of ML that captures thepolymorphic nature of field selection, together with a technique thatgeneralizes relational operators to arbitrary data structures. Thecombination provides a statically typed language in which generalizedrelational databases may be cleanly represented as typed structures.As in ML types are inferred, which relieves the programmer of makingthe type assertions that may be required in a complex databaseenvironment. These extensions may also be used to provide staticpolymorphic typechecking in object-oriented languages and databases.A problem that arises with object-oriented databases is the apparentneed for dynamic typechecking when dealing with queries onheterogeneous collections of objects. An extension of the type systemneeded for generalized relational operations can also be used formanipulating collections of dynamically typed values in a staticallytyped language. A prototype language based on these ideas has beenimplemented. While it lacks a proper treatment of persistent data, itdemonstrates that a wide variety of database structures can becleanly represented in a polymorphic programming language.

The class ofevent-recording automata is, on one hand, expressive enough to model(finite) timed transition systems and, on the other hand,determinizable and closed under all boolean operations. As a result,the language inclusion problem is decidable for event-recordingautomata. We present a translation from timed transition systems toevent-recording automata, which leads to an algorithm for checking iftwo timed transition systems have the same set of timed behaviors. Wealso consider event-predicting automata, which contain clocks thatpredict the time of the next occurrence of an event. The class ofevent-clock automata, which contain both event-recording andevent-predicting clocks, is a suitable specification language forreal-time properties.

Title: Asymptotic Properties of Data Compression and Suffix Trees
Abstract: Recently, Wyner and Ziv have proved that the typical length of arepeated subword found within the first n positions of a stationaryergodic sequence is (1=h) log n in probability where h is the entropyof the alphabet. This finding was used to obtain several insightsinto certain universal data compression schemes, most notably theLempel-Ziv data compression algorithm. Wyner and Ziv have alsoconjectured that their result can be extended to a stronger almostsure convergence. In this paper, we settle this conjecture in thenegative in the so called right domain asymptotic, that is, during adynamic phase of expanding the data base. We prove -- under anadditional assumption involving mixing conditions -- that the lengthof a typical repeated subword oscillates almost surely (a.s.) between(1=h 1 ) log n and (1=h 2 ) log n where 0 ! h 2 ! h h 1 ! 1. We alsoshow that the length of the nth block in the Lempel-Ziv parsingalgorithm reveals a similar behavior. We relate our findings to...

Title: A compendium of problems complete for P
Abstract: This paper serves two purposes. Firstly, it is an elementaryintroduction to thetheory of P-completeness --- the branch of complexity theory thatfocuses on identifyingthe problems in the class P that are "hardest," in thesense that they appear tolack highly parallel solutions. That is, they do not have parallelsolutions using timepolynomial in the logarithm of the problem size and a polynomialnumber of processorsunless all problem in P have such solutions, or equivalently, unlessP = NC . Secondly,this paper is a reference work of P-complete problems. We present acompilation ofthe known P-complete problems, including several unpublished or newP-completenessresults, and many open problems.This is a preliminary version, mainly containing the problem list.Thelatest version of this document is available in electronic form byanonymousftp from thorhild.cs.ualberta.ca (129.128.4.53) as either acompresseddvi file (TR91-11.dvi.Z) or as a compressed postscript file(TR91-11...

Abstract: We outline some requirements for a comprehensive methodology forbuilding ontologies, and review some important work that has beendone in the area which could contribute to this goal. We describe ourown experiences in constructing a significant ontology, emphasisingthe ontology capture phase. We first consider the very general issueof categorisation in modelling, and relate it to the process ofontology capture. We then describe the procedure that we used toidentify the terms and produce definitions. We describe a successfulway to handle ambiguous terms, which can be an enormous obstacle toreaching a shared understanding. Other important findings include: itmay not be necessary to identify competency questions before buildingthe ontology; the meta-ontology can be chosen after detailed textdefinitions are produced; defining terms which are 'cognitivelybasic' first can lead to less re-work.

Title: On the Interleaving Semantics of Transformation Units---A Step into GRACE
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to introduce the notion of a transformationunit together with its interleaving semantics and to study it as ameans of constructing large graph transformation systems from smallones in a structured and systematic way. A transformation unitcomprises a set of rules, descriptions of initial and terminalgraphs, and a control condition. Moreover, it may import othertransformation units for structuring purposes. Its semantics is abinary relation between initial and terminal graphs which is given byinterleaving sequences. As a generalization of ordinary derivations,an interleaving sequence consists of direct derivation stepsinterleaved with calls of imported transformation units. It must obeythe control condition and may be seen as a kind of structuredderivation. The introduced framework is independent of a particulargraph transformation approach and, therefore, it may enhance theusefulness of graph transformations in many contexts.

Next we conducted a usability study, in anindustrial setting, to determine whether it would be effective inpractice. The case study illustrates that technology transfer effortscan benefit from a greater focus on practitioners' needs, and thatthis focus helps identify some of the open problems that limit formalmethods technology transfer. We also found that there is often atension between the scope of the problem to be solved and thespecificity of the solution. The greater the scope of the problem,the more general the formal method solution and, thus, the morecustomization that must be done to use it in a particularenvironment.

With theemergence of languages like C and LISP, Static Analysis of programswith dynamicstorage and recursive data structures has become a field of activeresearch. Such analysisis difficult, and the Static Analysis community has recognized theneed for simplifyingassumptions and approximate solutions. However, even under the commonsimplifyingassumptions, such analyses are harder than previously recognized. TwofundamentalStatic Analysis problems are May Alias and Must Alias. The former isnot recursive(i.e., is undecidable) and the latter is not recursively enumerable(i.e., is uncomputable),even when all paths are executable in the program being analyzed forlanguages withif-statements, loops, dynamic storage, and recursive data structures.Categories and Subject Descriptors: D.3.1 [Programming Languages...

Title: An action-based framework for verifying logical and behavioural properties of concurrent systems
Abstract: A system is described which supports proving both behavioural andlogical properties of concurrent systems; these are specified bymeans of a process algebra and its associated logic. The logic is anaction based version of the branching time logic CTL, which we callACTL. It is interpreted over transition labelled structures while CTLis interpreted over state labelled ones. The core of the system aretwo existing tools, AUTO and EMC. The first builds the labelledtransition system corresponding to a term of a process algebra andpermits proof of equivalence and simplification of terms, while thesecond checks the validity of CTL logical formulae. The integrationis realized by means of two translation functions from the actionbased branching time logic ACTL to CTL and from transition-labelledto state-labelled structures. The correctness of the integration isguaranteed by the proof that the two translation functions whencoupled preserve satisfiability of logical formulae. 1. Intro...

Onthe other hand, there may be a significant overhead in creating theinfrastructure needed to support a DSL. To solve this problem, amethodology is described for building domain specific embeddedlanguages (DSELs), in which a DSL is designed within an existing,higher-order and typed, programming language such as Haskell or ML.In addition, techniques are described for building modularinterpreters and tools for DSELs. The resulting methodologyfacilitates reuse of syntax, semantics, implementation code, softwaretools, as well as look-and-feel.

Title: Two Components of an Action Language
Abstract: Some of the recent work on representing action makes use ofhigh-level action languages.In this paper we show that an action language can be represented asthe sum of two distinctparts: an "action description language" and an "actionquery language." A set of propositionsin an action description language describes the effects of actions onstates. Mathematically, itdefines a transition system of the kind familiar from the theory offinite automata. An actionquery language serves for expressing properties of paths in a giventransition system. We definethe general concepts of a transition system, of an action descriptionlanguage and of an actionquery language, give a series of examples of languages of both kinds,and show how to combinea description language and a query language into one. Thisconstruction makes it possible todesign the two components of an action language independently, whichleads to the simplificationand clarification of the theory of actions.1 Introducti...

Title: Gates Accept Concurrent Behavior
Abstract: We represent concurrent processes as Boolean propositions or gates,cast in the role of acceptors of concurrent behavior. This properlyextends other mainstream representations of concurrent behavior suchas event structures, yet is defined more simply. It admits anintrinsic notion of duality that permits processes to be viewed aseither schedules or automata. Its algebraic structure is essentiallythat of linear logic, with its morphisms being consequence-preservingrenamings of propositions, and with its operations forming the coreof a natural concurrent programming language. 1 Introduction Weunderstand sequential behavior very well today, namely in terms ofacceptance of such behavior by sequential automata, e.g. a pushdownautomaton accepting an English sentence. We propose to understandconcurrent behavior via acceptance by concurrent automata of aparticularly simple kind, namely Boolean gates as devicesimplementing Boolean propositions.

Title: A Control-Theoretic Approach to Flow Control
Abstract: This paper presents a control-theoretic approach to reactive flowcontrol in networks that do not reserve bandwidth. We assume around-robin-like queue service discipline in the output queues ofthe network's switches, and propose deterministic and stochasticmodels for a single conversation in a network of such switches.These models motivate the Packet-Pair rate probing technique,and a provably stable rate-based flow control scheme. A Kalmanstate estimator is derived from discrete-time state space analysis,but there are difficulties in using the estimator in practice. Thesedifficulties are overcome by a novel estimation scheme based onfuzzy logic. We then present a technique to extract and useadditionalinformation from the system to develop a continuous-timesystem model. This is used to design a variant of the control lawthat is also provably stable, and, in addition, takes control actionas rapidly as possible. Finally, practical issues such as correctingparameter drift an...

Title: Combining fuzzy information from multiple systems (extended abstract)
Abstract: : In a traditional database system, the result of a query is a set ofvalues (thosevalues that satisfy the query). In other data servers, such as asystem with queries based onimage content, or many text retrieval systems, the result of a queryis a sorted list. For example,in the case of a system with queries based on image content, thequery might ask for objectsthat are a particular shade of red, and the result of the query wouldbe a sorted list of objectsin the database, sorted by how well the color of the object matchesthat given in the query.A multimedia system must somehow synthesize both types of queries(those whose result is aset, and those whose result is a sorted list) in a consistent manner.In this paper we discussthe solution adopted by Garlic, a multimedia information system beingdeveloped at the IBMAlmaden Research Center. This solution is based on "graded"(or "fuzzy") sets.Issues of efficient query evaluation in a multimedia system are verydifferent fro...

Title: Possibilistic Logic
Abstract: This paper is organized as follows : Section 2 pursues the overviewby introducing background material on fuzzy set and possibilitytheory, including comparative possibility relations that underliepossibility and necessity measures. Section 3 forms the main body ofthe paper and presents formal aspects of a fragment of possibilisticlogic where formulas are valued by a lower bound on their degree ofnecessity. It includes an axiomatization and a refutation methodbased on extended resolution that is liable of implementation on acomputer and supports partial inconsistency. The remainder of Section3 lays bare the existing links between possibilistic logic andnon-monotonic logics on the one hand, and belief revision on theother hand. It is indicated that possibilistic logic can be cast inthe frameworks of preference logics after Shoham (1988),counterfactual logics after Lewis (1973) and epistemic entrenchmenttheory after Gärdenfors (1988). In the presence of partialinconsistency, possibilistic logic behaves as a cumulativenon-monotonic logic whose properties have been suggested by Gabbay(1985), and studied by Makinson (1989) and Kraus et al. (1990).Section 4 considers a richer possibilistic logic where formulas canbe weighted by a lower bound on possibility or necessity degrees.Then it briefly sketches some other potentially interestingextensions of possibilistic logic, whereby the valuation set maybecome partially ordered, the weights may become variable or conveythe interpretation of costs, and the predicates may become vague.Section 5 describes some applications of possibilistic logic totruth-maintenance systems, inconsistency handling in logical databases, discrete optimization and logic programming. 5 2.

Abstract: Knowledge-base (KB) systems must typically deal with imperfection inknowledge, e.g. in the form of imcompleteness, inconsistency,uncertainty, to name a few. Currently KB system development is mainlybased on the expert system technology. Expert systems, through theirsupport for rule-based programming, uncertainty, etc., offer aconvenient framework for KB system development. But they require theuser to be well versed with the low level details of systemimplementation. The manner in which uncertainty is handled has littlemathematical basis. There is no decent notion of query optimization,forcing the user to take the responsibility for an efficientimplementation of the KB system. We contend KB system development canand should take advantage of the deductive database technology, whichovercomes most of the above limitations. An important problem here isto extend deductive databases into providing a systematic basis forrule-based programming with imperfect knowledge.

Title: Stability and robustness for hybrid systems
Abstract: Stability and robustness issues for hybrid systems are considered inthis paper. General stability results that areextensions of classical Lyapunov theory have recently beenformulated. However, these results are in general notstraightforward to apply due to the following reasons. First, asearch for multiple Lyapunov functions must beperformed. However, existing theory does not unveil how to find suchfunctions. Secondly, if the most generalstability result is applied, knowledge about the continuoustrajectory is required, at least at some time instants.Because of these drawbacks stronger conditions for stability aresuggested, in which case it is shown that thesearch for Lyapunov functions can be formulated as a linear matrixinequality (LMI) problem for hybrid systemsconsisting of linear subsystems. Additionally, it is shown howrobustness properties can be achieved when theLyapunov functions are given. Specifically, it is described how todetermine permitted switch regions ...

Thus the merits of doingconsistent judgements in uncertain domains and theadvantages of modularity and incrementality of rulebasedapplication development come together. We alsocan offer mechanisms to trace down inconsistencies thatmay be hidden in very large collections of uncertainrules. As next-generation applications will have to handlevast amounts of uncertain data, an integration intodatabases is mandatory. We give a direct implementationof our calculus on top of a database system with aDATALOG-interface. In this way we extend currentdatabase technology towards providing new applicationswith new suitable primitives and with a databaseplatform for coping with uncertainty.1. Intro...

Title: Generating Fuzzy Rules from Examples Using Genetic Algorithms
Abstract: The problem of generation desirable fuzzy rulesis very important in the development of fuzzysystems. The purpose of this paper is topresent a generation method of fuzzy controlrules by learning from examples using geneticalgorithms. We propose a real coded geneticalgorithm for learning fuzzy rules, and an iterativeprocess for obtaining a set of rules whichcovers the examples set with a covering valuepreviously defined.Keywords: Fuzzy rules, learning, genetic algorithms.1. IntroductionFuzzy rules based systems have been shownto be an important tool for modeling complexsystems, where due to the complexity or theimprecision, classical tools are unsuccessful.In [19, 5] it was proved that fuzzy systemsare universal approximators in the sense thatfor any continuous systems is possible to find aset of fuzzy rules able of approximating it witharbitrary accuracy. The problem is how to findthe rules.There are different modes to derive them:- Based on Expert Experience ...

Title: Fast-Learning VIEWNET Architectures for Recognizing Three-dimensional Objects from Multiple Two-dimensional Views
Abstract: The recognition of 3-D objects from sequences of their 2-D views ismodeled by a family of self-organizing neural architectures, calledVIEWNET, that use View Information Encoded With NETworks. VIEWNETincorporates a preprocessor that generates a compressed but 2-Dinvariant representation of an image, a supervised incrementallearning system that classifies the preprocessed representations into2-D view categories whose outputs are combined into 3-D invariantobject categories, and a working memory that makes a 3-D objectprediction by accumulating evidence from 3-D object category nodes asmultiple 2-D views are experienced. The simplest VIEWNET achieveshigh recognition scores without the need to explicitly code thetemporal order of 2-D views in working memory. Working memories arealso discussed that save memory resources by implicitly codingtemporal order in terms of the relative activity of 2-D view categorynodes, rather than as explicit 2-D view transitions.

Title: Incorporating Advice into Agents that Learn from Reinforcements
Abstract: Learning from reinforcements is a promising approachfor creating intelligent agents. However, reinforcementlearning usually requires a large number of trainingepisodes. We present an approach that addresses thisshortcoming by allowing a connectionist Q-learner toaccept advice given, at any time and in a naturalmanner, by an external observer. In our approach,the advice-giver watches the learner and occasionallymakes suggestions, expressed as instructions in a simpleprogramming language. Based on techniques fromknowledge-based neural networks, these programs areinserted directly into the agent's utility function. Subsequentreinforcement learning further integrates andrefines the advice. We present empirical evidence thatshows our approach leads to statistically-significantgains in expected reward. Importantly, the advice improvesthe expected reward regardless of the stage oftraining at which it is given.IntroductionA successful and increasingly popular method for cr...

Title: Blending Reactivity and Goal-Directedness in a Fuzzy Controller
Abstract: Controlling the movement of an autonomousmobile robot requires the ability to pursuestrategic goals in a highly reactive way. Wedescribe a fuzzy controller for such a mobile robotthat can take abstract goals into consideration.Through the use of fuzzy logic, reactive behavior(e.g., avoiding obstacles on the way) and goalorientedbehavior (e.g., trying to reach a given location)are smoothly blended into one sequenceof control actions. The fuzzy controller has beenimplemented on the SRI robot Flakey.I. IntroductionAutonomous operation of a mobile robot in a real environmentposes a series of problems. In the general case,knowledge of the environment is partial and approximate;sensing is noisy; the dynamics of the environment can onlybe partially predicted; and robot's hardware execution isnot completely reliable. Though, the robot must take decisionsand execute actions at the time-scale of the environment.Classical planning approaches have been criticizedfor not being...

Title: Building Probabilistic Models for Natural Language
Abstract: Building models of language is a central task in natural languageprocessing. Traditionally,language has been modeled with manually-constructed grammars thatdescribe whichstrings are grammatical and which are not; however, with the recentavailability of massiveamounts of on-line text, statistically-trained models are anattractive alternative. Thesemodels are generally probabilistic, yielding a score reflectingsentence frequency instead ofa binary grammaticality judgement. Probabilistic models of languageare a fundamentaltool in speech recognition for resolving acoustically ambiguousutterances. For example,we prefer the transcription forbear to four bear as the former stringis far more frequentin English text. Probabilistic models also have application inoptical character recognition,handwriting recognition, spelling correction, part-of-speech tagging,and machine translation.In this thesis, we investigate three problems involving theprobabilistic modeling of languag...

Genetic algorithms play a significant role, as search techniquesfor handlingcomplex spaces, in many fields such as artificial intelligence,engineering, robotic,etc. Genetic algorithms are based on the underlying genetic processin biologicalorganisms and on the natural evolution principles of populations.These algorithmsprocess a population of chromosomes, which represent search spacesolutions, withthree operations: selection, crossover and mutation.Under its initial formulation, the search space solutions are codedusing thebinary alphabet. However, the good properties related with thesealgorithms do notstem from the use of this alphabet; other coding types have beenconsidered forthe representation issue, such as real coding, which would seemparticularly naturalwhen tackling optimization problems of parameters with variables incontinuousdomains.

Title: Packet-pair flow control
Abstract: This paper presents the packet-pair rate-based feedback flow controlscheme. This scheme is designed fornetworks where individual connections do not reserve bandwidth andfor the available bitrate (best-effort)component of integrated networks. We assume a round-robin-like queueservice discipline in the outputqueues of the network's switches, and propose a linear stochasticmodel for a single conversation in a networkof such switches. These model motivates the Packet-Pair rate probingtechnique, which forms the basisfor provably stable discrete and continuous time rate-based flowcontrol schemes. We present a novelstate estimation scheme based on fuzzy logic. We then address severalpractical concerns: dealing withsystem startup, retransmission and timeout strategy, and dynamicsetpoint probing.

Title: Imprecision in Finite Resolution Spatial Data
Abstract: An important component of spatial data quality is the imprecisionresulting from the resolution at which data are represented. Currentresearch on topics such as spatial data integration andgeneralisation needs to be well-founded on a theory ofmulti-resolution. This paper provides a formal framework for treatingthe notion of resolution and multi-resolution in geographic spaces.It goes further to develop an approach to reasoning with imprecisionabout spatial entities and relationships resulting from finiteresolution representations. The approach is similar to aspects ofrough and fuzzy set theories. The paper concludes by providing thebeginnings of a geometry of vague spatial entities and relationships.Keywords: uncertainty, vagueness, rough set, fuzzy set, resolution,spatial reasoning, data quality 1.

This paperdescribes PRSLite, a task-level controller grounded in a proceduralknowledge approach to action description. The controller embodiesmuch of the philosophy that underlies the Procedural Reasoning System(PRS) but in a minimalist fashion.

Both of these featuresare critical for supporting the management of continuous processesemployed in current-generation robots.

Title: Genetic design of fuzzy controllers
Abstract: This paper considers the application of genetic algorithms as ageneral methodology for automatically generating fuzzy processcontrollers. In contrast to prior genetic-fuzzy systems whichrequire that every input-output combination be enumerated, wepropose a novel encoding scheme which maintains only those rulesnecessary to control the target system. The key to our method,demonstrated on the classic cart-pole problem, is to represent eachfuzzy system as an unordered list of an arbitrary number of rules.Both the composition and size of the rule base evolve from an initialrandom state. By using a compact rule base representation,successful systems evolve quickly, increasing the likelihood ofsuccess when applied to more complex problems.1.

Abstract: We examine several formulations of the common practice of jumping toconclusions when actions demanddecisions but solid knowledge fails. This practice permeatesartificial intelligence, where systems assumemany conclusions automatically as defaults simply because thequestions they decide are known to occurfrequently, and where other assumptions are formulated and adoptedonly when ignorance stalls action.After developing the motivations and general nature of theseinferences, we introduce a formal basis for describingthem. This formulation allows separate introduction of the severalideas involved, and so facilitatescharacterization of some important combinations and some previousproposals. Initial results are provedabout these theories, including the aptness of the formal notionswith respect to the intuitive motivations.Benefits of this formulation include an indication of the waysnotions from logic and metamathematicscan enter into psychologies without subscribing to all...

Title: A General Framework for Adaptive Processing of Data Structures
Abstract: A structured organization of information is typically required bysymbolic processing. On the other hand, most connectionist modelsassume that data are organized according to relatively poorstructures, like arrays or sequences. The framework described in thispaper is an attempt to unify adaptive models like artificial neuralnets and belief nets for the problem of processing structuredinformation. In particular, relations between data variables areexpressed by directed acyclic graphs, where both numerical andcategorical values coexist. The general framework proposed in thispaper can be regarded as an extension of both recurrent neuralnetworks and hidden Markov models to the case of acyclic graphs. Inparticular we study the supervised learning problem as the problem oflearning transductions from an input structured space to an outputstructured space, where transductions are assumed to admit arecursive hidden state space representation.

In particular, we examine topologies forachieving continuity of maps from a set of measurementsof continuous dynamics to a finite set of inputsymbols and from a finite set of output symbols intothe control space for those continuous dynamics.Finding some anomalies in completing this loop,we discuss a new view of hybrid systems that maybroach them and is more in line with traditional controlsystems. In fact, the most widely used fuzzycontrol system is related to this new view and doesnot possess these anomalies. Indeed, we show thatfuzzy control leads to continuous maps (from measurementsto controls) and that all such continuousmaps may be implemented via fuzzy control.1 IntroductionIn traditional feedback control systems---continuoustime,discrete-time, and sampled-data---the mapsfrom output measurements to control inputs are continuous(in the usual met...

In the former, range measuresare collected through the robot exteroceptive sensors and processedin order to build a local representation of the surrounding area.This representation is then integrated in the global map so farreconstructed by filtering out insufficient or conflictinginformation. In the navigation phase, an A*-based planner generates alocal path from the current robot position to the goal. Such path issafe inside the explored area and provides a direction for furtherexploration. The robot follows the path up to the boundary of theexplored area, terminating its motion if unexpected obstacles areencountered.

Title: Genetic algorithms in control systems engineering: A brief introduction
Abstract: Genetic algorithms (GAs) are global, parallel, stochastic searchmethods, founded onDarwinian evolutionary principles. Many variations exist, includinggenetic programming andmultiobj ective algorithms. During the last decade GAs have beenapplied in a variety of areas,with varying degrees of success within each. A significantcontribution has been made withincontrol systems engineering. GAs exhibit considerable robustness inproblem domains thatare not conducive to formal, rigorous, classical analysis. They arenot limited by typicalcontrol problem attributes such as ill-behaved objective functions,the existence ofconstraints, and variations in the nature of control variables. GAsoftware tools are available,but there is no 'industry standard'. The computational complexity ofthe GA has proved to bethe chief impediment to real-time application of the technique.Hence, the majority ofapplications that use GAs are, by nature, off-line. GAs have beenused to optimise bothstructure and parameter values for both controllers and plant models.They have also beenapplied to fault diagnosis, stability analysis, robot path-planning,and combinatorial problems(such as scheduling and bin-packing). Hybrid approaches have provedpopular, with GAsbeing integrated in fuzzy logic and neural computing schemes. The GAhas been used as thepopulation-based engine for multiobjective optimisers. Multiple,Pareto-optimal, solutionscan be represented simultaneously. In such schemes, a decision-makercan lead the directionof future search. Interesting future developments are anticipated inon-line applications andmultiobjective search and decision-making.

Title: Timed Possibilistic Logic
Abstract: . This paper is an attempt to cast both uncertainty and time in alogicalframework. It generalizes possibilistic logic, previously developedby the authors,where each classical formula is associated with a weight which obeysthe laws ofpossibility theory. In the possibilistic temporal logic we presenthere, each formulais associated with a time set (a fuzzy set in the more general case)which representsthe set of instants where the formula is certainly true (more or lesscertainly true inthe general case). When a particular instant is fixed we recoverpossibilistic logic.Timed possibilistic logic generalizes possibilistic logic also in thesense that wesubstitute the lattice structure of the set of the (fuzzy) subsets ofthe temporal scaleto the lattice structure underlying the certainty weights inpossibilistic logic. Thusmany results from possibilistic logic can be straightforwardlygeneralized to timedpossibilistic logic. Illustrative examples are given.1. Introduction...

Title: Fuzzy Logic in Artificial Intelligence
Abstract: After a basic introduction of fuzzy logic, we discuss its role inartificial and computational intelligence. Then we present innovativeapplications of fuzzy logic, focusing on fuzzy expert systems, withone typical example explored in some detail. The article concludeswith suggestions how artificial intelligence and fuzzy logic canbenefit from each other. I. Introduction In 1948, Alan Turing wrote apaper [1] marking the begin of a new era, the era of the intelligentmachine, which raised questions that still remain unanswered today.This era was heavily influenced by the appearance of the computer, amachine that allowed humans to automate their way of thinking.However, human thinking is not exact. If you had to park your carprecisely in one place, you would have extreme difficulties. To allowcomputers to really mimic the way humans think, the theories of fuzzysets and fuzzy logic were created. They should be viewed as formalmathematical theories for the representation of un...

Title: The Composition and Validation of Heterogeneous Control Laws
Abstract: We present a method for creating and validating a nonlinearcontroller by the compositionof heterogeneous local control laws appropriate to differentoperating regions. Like fuzzy logiccontrol, these methods apply even in the presence of incompleteknowledge of the structure ofthe system, the boundaries of the operating regions, or even thecontrol action to take. Unlikefuzzy logic control, these methods can be analyzed by a combinationof classical and qualitativemethods. Each operating region of the system has a classical controllaw, which provides highresolutioncontrol and can be analyzed by classical methods. Operating regionsare defined byfuzzy set membership functions. The global control law is theweighted average of the localcontrol laws, where the weights are provided by the operating regionmembership functions. Aheterogeneous control law can be analyzed, even in the presence ofincomplete knowledge, byrepresenting it as a qualitative differential equation and usingqualitative simulation to predictthe set of possible behaviors of the system. By expressing thedesired guarantee as a statementin a modal temporal logic, the validity of the guarantee can beautomatically checked againstthe set of possible behaviors. We demonstrate heterogeneouscontrollers and our qualitativemethods for proving their properties, first for a simple levelcontroller for a water tank, andsecond for a highly nonlinear chemical reactor.

Abstract: Chu spaces have found applications in computer science, mathematics,and physics. Theyenjoy a useful categorical duality analogous to that of latticetheory and projective geometry. Asnatural mathematics Chu spaces borrow ideas from the naturalsciences, particularly physics,while as rational mechanics they cast Hamiltonian mechanics in termsof the interaction of bodyand mind.This paper addresses the chief stumbling block for Descartes'17th-century philosophy ofmind-body dualism, how can the fundamentally dissimilar mental andphysical planes causallyinteract with each other? We apply Cartesian logic to reject not onlydivine intervention,preordained synchronization, and the eventual mass retreat to monism,but also an assumptionDescartes himself somehow neglected to reject, that causalinteraction within these planes is aneasier problem than between. We use Chu spaces and residuation toderive all causal interaction,both between and within the two planes, from a uniform a...

Abstract: We describe the design and tuning of a controllerfor enforcing compliance with a prescribed velocityprofile for a rail-based transportation system. Thisrequires following a trajectory, rather than fixed setpoints(as in automobiles). We synthesize a fuzzycontroller for tracking the velocity profile, while providinga smooth ride and staying within the prescribedspeed limits. We use a genetic algorithm totune the fuzzy controller's performance by adjustingits parameters (the scaling factors and the membershipfunctions) in a sequential order of significance.We show that this approach results in a controllerthat is superior to the manually designed one, andwith only modest computational effort. This makesit possible to customize automated tuning to a varietyof different configurations of the route, the terrain,the power configuration, and the cargo.1. Introduction1.1.

Abstract: Hybrid Intelligent Systems that combine knowledge based andartificial neural network systems typically have four phasesinvolving domain knowledge representation, mapping of this knowledgeinto an initial connectionist architecture, network training, andrule extraction respectively. The final phase is important because itcan provide a trained connectionist architecture with explanationpower and validate its output decisions. Moreover, it can be used torefine and maintain the initial knowledge acquired from domainexperts. In this paper, we introduce three new rule extractiontechniques.

Thesecond technique extracts partial rules that represent the mostimportant embedded knowledge in a trained network. The fidelity ofthe second technique is adjustable to the desired level of knowledgeextraction. The third technique is a comprehensive and universalapproach. A ru...

Heyting algebras, co-Heytingalgebras, and bi-Heyting algebras are structures having considerablepotential for the theoretical basis of these ontologies. This papergives an introduction to these Heyting structures, and providesevidence of their importance as algebraic theories of sets ofregions. The main evidence is a proof that elements of certainHeyting algebras provide models of the Region-Connection Calculusdeveloped by Cohn et al. By using the mathematically well knowntechniques of "pointless topology", it is straightforwardto conduct this proof without any need to assume that regions consistof sets of points. Further evidence is provided by a new qualitativetheory of regions with indeterminate boundaries. This theory usesmodal operators which are related to the algebraic operations presentin a bi-Heyting algebra.

Abstract: The process of learning is not always as simple asmapping inputs to the best outputs. Often internalstate is needed to distinguish between observablyidentical states of the world. Genetic programminghas concentrated on solving problems in thefunctional/reactive arena, in part because of theabsence of a natural way to incorporate memory intothe paradigm. This paper presents a simple additionto the genetic programming paradigm that seamlesslyincorporates the evolution of the effective gathering,storage, and retrieval of arbitrarily complicated stateinformation. Experimental results show that theeffective production and use of complex statestructures can be evolved and that agents evolvingthe use of memory quickly and permanently displacepurely reactive and non-deterministic functions.These results may not only aid future research intothe causes and constituents of mental models but mayexpand the types of problems that can be practicallytackled by gen...

Title: Mobile Network Estimation
Abstract: Mobile systems must adapt their behavior to changing networkconditions. To do this, they must accurately estimate availablenetwork capacity. Producing quality estimates is challenging becausenetwork observations are noisy, particularly in mobile, ad hocnetworks. Current systems depend on simple, exponentially-weightedmoving average (EWMA) filters. These filters are either able todetect true changes quickly or to mask observed noise and transients,but cannot do both. In this paper, we present four filters designedto react quickly to persistent changes while tolerating transientnoise. Such filters are agile when possible, but stable whennecessary, adapting their behavior to prevailing conditions. Thesefilters are evaluated in a variety of networking situations,including persistent and transient change, congestion, and topologychanges. We find that one filter, based on techniques fromstatistical process control, provides performance superior to theother three. Compared to two EWMA filters, one agile and the otherstable, it is able to offer the agility of the former in four of fivescenarios and the stability of the latter in three of four scenarios.Keywords mobile network estimation, filtering, adaptive systems 1

Title: The Interpretation of Fuzziness
Abstract: Without a clear interpretation of fuzziness, it is hard for fuzzylogic to justify its rules, to get initial data from users, or tomake its results understandable. It is possible to interpret grade ofmembership, at least in some cases, as the proportion of positiveevidence. In this way, fuzziness and randomness can be uniformlytreated. 1 Zadeh on Fuzziness Zadeh's idea of "fuzzy set"came from an observation: classes of objects in everyday thinkingusually have no well-defined boundary ([29]). More concretely, hemade the following claims: 1. For these classes, no two-valuedmembership function can be defined on instances, and there are alwaysinstances that standing on the boundary, such as (his example)"animal", "beautiful women", "tallmen", and "real numbers which are much greater than1". 2. The above fact doesn't mean there is nothing we can sayabout the membership relation between a class (or a set, a concept)and an object (or an instance). On the contrary, such a relati...

It is possible to show thatthis representation is assoziative. Moreoverthis connectionist strategy allows to use semantics and contextduring the unification. The network is ableto learn context sensitive strategies and unification with extensionslike E-unification (unification under acertain equational-theory E). So unification by a network becomes notonly very cheap cause of the constantpropagation-time of the bp-net but it gives also the ability tointerpret its output as a mechanism for uncertainty.1 Introduction Unification in general is a technique which utilizessubstitutions of variables with adequateterms to make term...

Title: A Fuzzy Perceptron as a Generic Model for Neuro--Fuzzy Approaches
Abstract: This paper presents a fuzzy perceptron as a generic model ofmultilayer fuzzy neuralnetworks, or neural fuzzy systems, respectively. This model issuggested to ease thecomparision of different neuro--fuzzy approaches that are known fromthe literature. Afuzzy perceptron is not a fuzzification of a common neural networkarchitecture, andit is not our intention to enhance neural learning algorithms byfuzzy methods.The idea of the fuzzy perceptron is to provide an architecture thatcan be initializedwith prior knowledge, and that can be trained using neural learningmethods. Thetraining is carried out in such a way that the learning result isinterpretable in theform of linguistic fuzzy if--then rules. Next to the advantage ofhaving a generic modelto compare neuro--fuzzy models, the fuzzy perceptron can bespecialized e.g. for dataanalysis and control tasks.1 IntroductionCombinations of neural networks and fuzzy systems have become verypopular during thelast two years [Be...

Abstract: The need for fast and accurate text entry on small handheld computershas led to a resurgence of interest in on-line word recognition usingartificial neural networks. Classical methods have been combined andimproved to produce robust recognition of hand-printed English text.The central concept of a neural net as a character classifierprovides a good base for a recognition system; long-standing issuesrelative to training, generalization, segmentation, probabilisticformalisms, etc., need to resolved, however, to get excellentperformance. A number of innovations in how to use a neural net as aclassifier in a word recognizer are presented: negative training,stroke warping, balancing, normalized output error, error emphasis,multiple representations, quantized weights, and integrated wordsegmentation all contribute to efficient and robust performance.

Title: Identification of Roads in Satellite Imagery Using Artificial Neural Networks: A Contextual Approach
Abstract: Humans can fairly easily identify roads in remotesensing images, but this has turned out to be a difficult task forcomputers. Most previous work in this area has utilized statisticaland rule-based techniques, which depended primarily upon spectralinformation. However, it appears that spectral information alone isinsufficient to identify roads in Landsat Thematic Mapper satelliteimagery, since soils have the same spectral signature in the data asroads, and that contextual information is required. In thisapplication, artificial neural networks are found to be superior toseveral previous techniques due in part to their ability toincorporateboth spectral and contextual information. However, a number offactors cause problems for the network, and further work must bedone to include additional information; it is suggested that a hybridsystem might alleviate most of these difficulties.Key words: Artificial neural networks, Satellite imageryclassification, Artificial intelligenc...

Title: Dynamic Source Routing in Ad Hoc Wireless Networks
Abstract: An ad hoc network is a collection of wireless mobile hosts forming atemporary network without theaid of any established infrastructure or centralized administration.In such an environment, it may benecessary for one mobile host to enlist the aid of other hosts inforwarding a packet to its destination,due to the limited range of each mobile host's wirelesstransmissions. This paper presents a protocolfor routing in ad hoc networks that uses dynamic source routing. Theprotocol adapts quickly to routingchanges when host movement is frequent, yet requires little or nooverhead during periods in whichhosts move less frequently. Based on results from a packet-levelsimulation of mobile hosts operating inan ad hoc network, the protocol performs well over a variety ofenvironmental conditions such as hostdensity and movement rates. For all but the highest rates of hostmovement simulated, the overhead ofthe protocol is quite low, falling to just 1% of total data packetstransmitte...

Title: A comparison of mechanisms for improving TCP performance over wireless links
Abstract: Reliable transport protocols such as TCP are tuned toperform well in traditional networks where packetlosses occur mostly because of congestion. However,networks with wireless and other lossy links also sufferfrom significant losses due to bit errors and handoffs.TCP responds to all losses by invokingcongestion control and avoidance algorithms, resultingin degraded end-to-end performance in wireless andlossy systems. In this paper, we compare severalschemes designed to improve the performance of TCPin such networks. These schemes are classified intothree broad categories: end-to-end protocols, whereloss recovery is performed by the sender; link-layerprotocols, that provide local reliability; and split-connectionprotocols, that break the end-to-end connectioninto two parts at the base station. We present theresults of several experiments performed in both LANand WAN environments, using throughput and goodputas the metrics for comparison.1. Web page URL http://daedalus...

Abstract: An ad hoc network is a collection of wireless mobile nodesdynamically forming a temporary network without the use of anyexisting network infrastructure or centralized administration. Due tothe limited transmission range of wireless network interfaces,multiple network "hops" may be needed for one node toexchange data with another across the network. In recent years, avariety of new routing protocols targeted specifically at thisenvironment have been developed, but little performance informationon each protocol and no realistic performance comparison between themis available.

Such hosts cannot depend on traditional forms of networkconnectivity and routingbecause their location, and hence the route to reach them, cannot bededuced from their IPaddress. We present protocols that seamlessly integrate mobile hostsinto the current IP networkinginfrastructure. They are primarily targeted at supporting a campusenvironment withmobile computers, but also extend gracefully to accomodate hostsmoving between differentnetworks. The key feature is the dependence on ancillary machines totrack the location of themobile hosts.

Title: I-TCP: indirect TCP for mobile hosts
Abstract: IP based solutions to accommodate mobile hosts within existinginternetworks do not address the distinctive features of wirelessmobile computing. IP-based transport protocols thus suffer from poorperformance when a mobile host communicates with a host on the fixednetwork. This is caused by frequent disruptions in network layerconnectivity due to - i) mobility and ii) unreliable nature of thewireless link. We describe I-TCP, which is an indirect transportlayer protocol for mobile hosts. I-TCP utilizes the resources ofMobility Support Routers (MSRs) to provide transport layercommunication between mobile hosts and hosts on the fixed network.With I-TCP, the problems related to mobility and unreliability ofwireless link are handled entirely within the wireless link; theTCP/IP software on the fixed hosts is not modified. Using I-TCP onour testbed, the throughput between a fixed host and a mobile hostimproved substantially in comparison to regular TCP

Title: A Highly Adaptive Distributed Routing Algorithm for Mobile Wireless Networks
Abstract: We present a new distributed routing protocol formobile, multihop, wireless networks. The protocol is oneof a family of protocols which we term "link reversal"algorithms. The protocol's reaction is structured as atemporally-ordered sequence of diffusing computations;each computation consisting of a sequence of directed linkreversals. The protocol is highly adaptive, efficient andscalable; being best-suited for use in large, dense, mobilenetworks. In these networks, the protocol's reaction tolink failures typically involves only a localized "singlepass" of the distributed algorithm. This capability isunique among protocols which are stable in the face ofnetwork partitions, and results in the protocol's highdegree of adaptivity . This desirable behavior is achievedthrough the novel use of a "physical or logical clock" toestablish the "temporal order" of topological changeevents which is used to structure (or order) thealgorithm's reaction to topological changes.

Ournew routing algorithm is quite suitable for a dynamic selfstartingnetwork, as required by users wishing to utilize ad-hoc networks.AODV provides loop-free routes even while repairing broken links.Because the protocol does not require global periodic routingadvertisements, the demand on the overall bandwidth available to themobile nodes is substantially less than in those protocols that donecessitate such advertisements.

Abstract: Active networks allow their users to inject customized programs intothe nodes of the network. An extreme case, in which we are mostinterested, replaces packets with "capsules" -- programfragments that are executed at each network router/switch theytraverse. Active architectures permit a massive increase in thesophistication of the computation that is performed within thenetwork. They will enable new applications, especially those based onapplication-specific multicast, information fusion, and otherservices that leverage network-based computation and storage.Furthermore, they will accelerate the pace of innovation bydecoupling network services from the underlying hardware and allowingnew services to be loaded into the infrastructure on demand. In thispaper, we describe our vision of an active network architecture,outline our approach to its design, and survey the technologies thatcan be brought to bear on its implementation.

Title: Effective erasure codes for reliable computer communication protocols
Abstract: Reliable communication protocols require that all the intendedrecipients of a message receive the message intact. Automatic RepeatreQuest (ARQ) techniques are used in unicast protocols, but they donot scale well to multicast protocols with large groups of receivers,since segment losses tend to become uncorrelated thus greatlyreducing the effectiveness of retransmissions. In such cases, ForwardError Correction (FEC) techniques can be used, consisting in thetransmission of redundant packets (based on error correcting codes)to allow the receivers to recover from independent packet losses.Despite the widespread use of error correcting codes in many fieldsof information processing, and a general consensus on the usefulnessof FEC techniques within some of the Internet protocols, very fewactual implementations exist of the latter. This probably derivesfrom the different types of applications, and from concerns relatedto the complexity of implementing such codes in software. To f...

Abstract: We explore the performance of reliable data communication in mobilecomputing environments. Motion across wireless cell boundaries causesincreased delays and packet losses while the network learns how toroute data to a host's new location. Reliable transport protocolslike TCP interpret these delays and losses as signs of networkcongestion. They consequently throttle their transmissions, furtherdegrading performance. We quantify this degradation throughmeasurements of protocol behavior in a wireless networking testbed.We show how current TCP implementations introduce unacceptably longpauses in communication during cellular handoffs (800 millisecondsand longer), and propose an end-to-end fast retransmission schemethat can reduce these pauses to levels more suitable for humaninteraction (200 milliseconds).

Abstract: TCP is a reliable transport protocol tuned to perform well intraditional networks where congestion is the primarycause of packet loss. However, networks with wireless links andmobile hosts incur significant losses due to biterrorsand handoff.

Title: Energy efficient indexing on air
Abstract: We consider wireless broadcasting of data as a way of disseminatinginformation to a massive number of users. Organizingand accessing information on wireless communicationchannels is different from the problem of organizing and accessingdata on the disk. We describe two methods, (1; m)Indexing and Distributed Indexing, for organizing and accessingbroadcast data. We demonstrate that the proposedalgorithms lead to significant improvement of battery life,while retaining a low access time.1 IntroductionThe physical requirements of wireless communicationchannels, make the problem of organizing wirelessbroadcast data different from data organization on thedisk. Index based organization of data transmitted overwireless channels, is very important from the power conservationpoint of view and can result in significant improvementin battery utilization. New technology canutilize and build upon some well known techniques forfile organization and access. These traditional solutio...

Title: MACAW: A Media Access Protocol for Wireless LAN's
Abstract: In recent years, a wide variety of mobile computing deviceshas emerged, including portables, palmtops, and personaldigital assistants. Providing adequate network connectivityfor these devices will require a new generation of wirelessLAN technology. In this paper we study media access protocolsfor a single channel wireless LAN being developed atXerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center. We startwith the MACA media access protocol first proposed byKarn [9] and later refined by Biba [3] which uses an RTSCTS-DATA packet exchange and binary exponential backoff.Using packet-level simulations, we examine various performanceand design issues in such protocols. Our analysisleads to a new protocol, MACAW, which uses an RTS-CTSDS-DATA-ACK message exchange and includes a significantlydifferent backoff algorithm.1 IntroductionIn recent years, a wide variety of mobile computing deviceshave emerged, including palmtops, personal digital assistants,and portable computers.

Title: Topology Control of Multihop Wireless Networks Using Transmit Power Adjustment
Abstract: We consider the problem of adjusting the transmitpowers of nodes in a multihop wireless network (alsocalled an ad hoc network) to create a desired topology. Weformulate it as a constrained optimization problem with twoconstraints - connectivity and biconnectivity, and one optimizationobjective - maximum power used. We presenttwo centralized algorithms for use in static networks, andprove their optimality. For mobile networks, we present twodistributed heuristics that adaptively adjust node transmitpowers in response to topological changes and attempt tomaintain a connected topology using minimum power. Weanalyze the throughput, delay, and power consumption ofour algorithms using a prototype software implementation,an emulation of a power-controllable radio, and a detailedchannel model. Our results show that the performance ofmultihop wireless networks in practice can be substantiallyincreased with topology control.I. IntroductionA multihop wireless network is one in...

Title: Dissemination-based data delivery using broadcast disks
Abstract: Mobile computers and wireless networks are emerging technologieswhich promise to make ubiquitous computing a reality. One challengethat must be met in order to truly realize this potential is that ofproviding mobile clients with ubiquitous access to data. Mobileclients may often be disconnected from stationary server machines ormay have only a low-bandwidth channel for sending messages toservers. Such an environment raises difficulties for supportingdata-intensive applications for three reasons: 1) the inability topredict, with 100% accuracy, the future data needs of manyapplications, 2) limits on storage capacities of mobile machines, and3) the need to provide clients with new or updated data values. One(and perhaps the only) way to address these challenges is to providestationary server machines with a relatively high-bandwidth channelover which to broadcast data to a client population in anticipationof the need for that data at the clients. Such a system can be saidto...

Title: An Efficient Routing Protocol for Wireless Networks
Abstract: this paper describes a wireless routing protocol (WRP) for a packetradio network based on PFA, illustrating the key aspects of theprotocol's operation.The following sections show that the protocol is correct (i.e., thatit producescorrect routing tables within a finite time after topology changes)and comparesits performance with that of DBF, DUAL and an ideal link statealgorithm (ILS)which uses Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.ILS consists of ideal flooding of link-state updates in order toreplicate thetopology of the network at each router; ideal flooding means thatinfinite sequencenumbers can be used to validate link-state updates, and that all suchupdates aresuccessfully delivered at every router.2 -- Wireless Routing Protocol

Title: Balancing push and pull for data broadcast
Abstract: The increasing ability to interconnect computers throughinternetworking, wireless networks, high-bandwidth satellite, andcable networks has spawned a new class of information-centeredapplications based on data dissemination. These applications employbroadcast to deliver data to very large client populations. We haveproposed the Broadcast Disks paradigm [Zdon94, Acha95b] fororganizing the contents of a data broadcast program and for managingclient resources in response to such a program. Our previous work onBroadcast Disks focused exclusively on the "push-based"approach, where data is sent out on the broadcast channel accordingto a periodic schedule, in anticipation of client requests. In thispaper, we study how to augment the push-only model with a"pull-based" approach of using a backchannel to allowclients to send explicit requests for data to the server. We analyzethe scalability and performance of a broadcast-based system thatintegrates push and pull and study the imp...

Title: Adaptive protocols for information dissemination in wireless sensor networks
Abstract: In this paper, we present a family of adaptive protocols,called SPIN (Sensor Protocols for Information via Negotiation), that efficiently disseminates information amongsensors in an energy-constrained wireless sensor network.Nodes running a SPIN communication protocol nametheir data using high-level data descriptors, called metadata.They use meta-data negotiations to eliminate thetransmission of redundant data throughout the network. Inaddition, SPIN nodes can base their communication decisionsboth upon application-specific knowledge of thedata and upon knowledge of the resources that are availableto them. This allows the sensors to efficiently distributedata given a limited energy supply. We simulateand analyze the performance of two specific SPIN protocols,comparing them to other possible approaches and atheoretically optimal protocol. We find that the SPIN protocolscan deliver 60% more data for a given amount ofenergy than conventional approaches. We also find that,in terms of dissemination rate and energy usage, the SPINprotocols perform close to the theoretical optimum.

Abstract: IntroductionIn this work (see full report in [3]), we develop models and analysesfor studying the bulk throughputof four versions of TCP; namely, OldTahoe (the original protocol),Tahoe, Reno, and NewReno [2].We assume a local network scenario, in which a host on a local areanetwork (LAN) is transmittingbulk data to a mobile host connected to the LAN by a wireless link.Our models incorporateimportant aspects, such as, slow-start and congestion avoidance,coarse timers, fast-retransmit,and fast recovery. Assuming an uncorrelated random packet loss modelon the wireless link, weobtain the data throughput as a function of the packet errorprobability. Our results show howthe throughput degrades, for each version, with increasing packetloss probability. For a given lossprobability, our results quantify the performance improvementprovided by each version.As in [5] and [4], our analysis is also based on

Title: Comparative performance analysis of versions of TCP in a local network with a lossy link
Abstract: The scenario is that a bulk data transfer is being performed overa TCP connection, from a host on a local area network (LAN) to amobile host attached to the LAN by a radio link. In earlier work[10] we had assumed that packet losses in a TCP connection overa radio link are statistically independent. In this paper, we extendthis analysis to a Rayleigh fading link, which we model by a twostate Markov model. The bulk throughputs of TCP-OldTahoe andTCP-Tahoe are compared with and without fading, for various averagesignal-to-noise ratios. We also study the performance with a linkprotocol on the wireless link, and study the effect of varying thelinkpacket size, the number of link packet attempts, and the vehiclespeed.For the parameters of the BSD UNIX implementation, over a 1.5Mbpswireless link, we find that, with fading, a signal-to-noise ratio ofatleast 30dB is required to get reasonable throughput with TCP Tahoeor OldTahoe; this corresponds to at least 100 ti...

We compare the performance of twoprominent on-demand routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks --Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance VectorRouting (AODV). A detailed simulation model with MAC and physicallayer models is used to study inter-layer interactions and theirperformance implications. We demonstrate that even though DSR andAODV share a similar on-demand behavior, the differences in theprotocol mechanics can lead to significant performance differentials.The performance differentials are analyzed using varying networkload, mobility and network size. Based on the observations, we makerecommendations about how the performance of either protocol can beimproved.

Title: Fair scheduling in wireless packet networks
Abstract: Fair scheduling of delay and rate-sensitive packet flows overa wireless channel is not addressed effectively by most contemporarywireline fair scheduling algorithms because of twounique characteristics of wireless media: (a) bursty channelerrors, and (b) location-dependent channel capacity and errors.Besides, in packet cellular networks, the base stationtypically performs the task of packet scheduling for bothdownlink and uplink flows in a cell; however a base stationhas only a limited knowledge of the arrival processes of uplinkflows.In this paper, we propose a new model for wireless fairscheduling based on an adaptation of fluid fair queueing tohandle location-dependent error bursts. We describe anideal wireless fair scheduling algorithm which provides apacketized implementation of the fluid model while assumingfull knowledge of the current channel conditions. For thisalgorithm, we derive the worst-case throughput and delaybounds. Finally, we describe a practical wir...

Title: A Reliable Multicast data Distribution Protocol based on software FEC techniques
Abstract: Applications requiring the reliable distribution of data to groups ofclients would be supported perfectly by reliable multicast protocols.In many cases, the problem of congestion control (a major researchissue otherwise) does not exist because downlink bandwidth is"owned" or can be preallocated to a particular server byindependent means, but the problems of insuring reliable datadelivery to large groups, and adaptability to heterogeneous clients,still remain. These problems can be solved at once with the use ofFEC techniques. In this paper we show the design of a ReliableMulticast data Distribution Protocol (RMDP) that we have built usingthese techniques, and discuss the implementation tradeoffs.Experimental results show that, albeit somewhat expensive, doingencoding/decoding in software is affordable for speeds in the Mbit/srange even on low-end PCs. Slower machines can still receive at highspeed, thus optimizing network usage, by taking advantage of the factthat decodi...

Title: The Effects of Asymmetry on TCP Performance
Abstract: In this paper, we study the effects of network asymmetry on endto-end TCP performance and suggest techniques to improve it. Thenetworks investigated in this study include a wireless cable modemnetwork and a packet radio network. In recent literature (e.g.,[16]), asymmetry has been considered in terms of a mismatch inbandwidths in the two directions of a data transfer. We generalizethis notion of bandwidth asymmetry to other aspects of asymmetry,such as latency and media-access, and packet error rate, which arecommon in wide-area wireless networks. Using a combination ofexperiments on real networks and simulation, we analyze TCPperformance in such networks where the throughput achieved is notsolely a function of the link and traffic characteristics in thedirection of data transfer (the forward direction) , but dependssignificantly on the reverse direction as well. We focus on bandwidthand latency asymmetries, and propose and evaluate several schemes toimprove end-to-end p...

Title: The Effects of Mobility on Reliable Transport Protocols
Abstract: We explore the effects of host motion on the performance of activetransport-level connections. Motion causes increased delays andpacket losses while the network learns how to route data to a host'snew location. Reliable transport protocols interpret these delays andlosses as signs of network congestion. They consequently throttletheir transmissions, further degrading performance. We quantify thisdegradation through measurements of protocol behavior in a wirelessnetworking testbed. We show how current retransmission policiesintroduce unacceptably long pauses in communication (800 millisecondsand longer), and propose an end-to-end fast retransmission schemethat can reduce these pauses to levels more suitable for humaninteraction (200 milliseconds). Our work demonstrates that reliabletransport protocols must be made aware of mobility, and suggests howto adapt these protocols to mobile computing environments. 1Introduction Reliable transport protocols have been tuned for ne...

Title: Power-Aware Routing in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks
Abstract: In this paper we present a case for using new power-awaremetrics for determining routes in wireless ad hoc networks.We present five different metrics based on battery powerconsumption at nodes. We show that using these metricsin a shortest-cost routing algorithm reduces the cost/packetof routing packets by 5-30% over shortest-hop routing (thiscost reduction is on top of a 40-70% reduction in energy consumptionobtained by using PAMAS, our MAClayer protocol). Furthermore, using these new metrics ensures thatthe mean time to node failure is increased significantly. Aninteresting property of using shortest-cost routing is thatpacket delays do not increase. Finally,we note that our newmetrics can be used in most traditional routing protocols forad hoc networks.1 IntroductionAdHoc networks are multi-hop wireless networks where allnodes cooperatively maintain network connectivity.

Abstract: An ad hoc network is a collection of wireless mobile hostsforming a temporary network withoutthe aid of any centralizedadministration or standard support services. In suchan environment, it may be necessary for one mobile host toenlist the aid of others in forwarding a packet to its destination,due to the limited propagation range of each mobilehost's wireless transmissions. Some previous attempts havebeen made to use conventional routing protocols for routingin ad hoc networks, treating each mobile host as a router.This position paper points out a number of problems withthis design and suggests a new approach based on separateroute discovery and route maintenance protocols.1.

Abstract: Networking protocols are being modified to handle mobility of hosts.This paper argues that there is a need to make mobility explicit atevery level of the OSI model --- even above the network level throughuser or application level. Further, it is proposed that the mobilehost and the first hop (wireless link) of communication be handleddifferently than the rest of the network. Hence, in networks withmobile hosts, we propose a radical approach of indirect interactionbetween clients and servers. 1 Introduction The client-serverparadigm has served well for structuring applications in distributedsystems. The paradigm is implicitly based on two assumptions: 1) theend points of the communication link are fixed and 2) the underlyingnetwork infrastructure is to a large extent homogeneous (highbandwidth, reliable, and low latency). However, mobile hosts havedifferent characteristics from fixed hosts. Mobility implies thathosts will connect from different access points and ma...

Title: Packet Fair Queueing Algorithms for Wireless Networks with Location-Dependent Errors
Abstract: While Packet Fair Queueing (PFQ) algorithms provide both boundeddelay and fairness in wired networks, they cannot be applied directlyto wireless networks. The key difficulty is that in wireless networkssessions can experience location-dependent channel errors. This maylead to situations in which a session receives significantly lessservice than it is supposed to, while another receives more. Thisresults in large discrepancies between the sessions' virtual times,making it difficult to provide both delay-guarantees and fairnesssimultaneously. Our contribution is twofold. First, we identify a setof properties, called Channel-condition Independent Fair (CIF), thata Packet Fair Queueing algorithm should have in a wirelessenvironment: (1) delay and throughput guarantees for error-freesessions, (2) long term fairness for error sessions, (3) short termfairness for error-free sessions, and (4) graceful degradation forsessions that have received excess service.

Abstract: We present Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR), a novelrouting protocol for wireless datagram networks that uses thepositions of routers and a packet's destination to make packet forwardingdecisions. GPSR makes greedy forwarding decisions usingonly information about a router's immediate neighbors in thenetwork topology. When a packet reaches a region where greedyforwarding is impossible, the algorithm recovers by routing aroundthe perimeter of the region. By keeping state only about the localtopology, GPSR scales better in per-router state than shortest-pathand ad-hoc routing protocols as the number of network destinationsincreases. Under mobility's frequent topology changes, GPSR canuse local topology information to find correct new routes quickly.We describe the GPSR protocol, and use extensive simulation ofmobile wireless networks to compare its performance with that ofDynamic Source Routing.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the performance of routequery control mechanisms for the Zone Routing Protocol(ZRP) for ad hoc networks. ZRP proactively maintainsrouting information for a local neighborhood (routingzone), while reactively acquiring routes to destinationsbeyond the routing zone. This hybrid routing approach canbe more efficient than traditional routing schemes.However, without proper query control techniques, ZRPcannot provide the expected reduction in the control traffic.Our proposed query control schemes exploit the structureof the routing zone to provide enhanced detection andprevention of overlapping queries. These techniques can beapplied to single-channel or multiple-channel ad hocnetworks to improve both the delay and control trafficperformance of ZRP. Our query control mechanismsallow ZRP to provide routes to all accessible network nodes,with less control traffic than purely proactive link state orpurely reactive route discovery, and with less delay thanconventional flood searching.Index Terms- ad-hoc network, routing protocol, routingzone, ZRP, zone routing protocol, proactive routing,reactive routing, hybrid routing, bordercast, query controlI.

Title: The Anatomy of a Context-Aware Application
Abstract: We describe a platform for context-aware computing whichenables applications to follow mobile users as they movearound a building. The platform is particularly suitable forrichly equipped, networked environments. The only item auser is required to carry is a small sensor tag, which identifiesthem to the system and locates them accurately in threedimensions. The platform builds a dynamic model of the environmentusing these location sensors and resource informationgathered by telemetry software, and presents it in a formsuitable for application programmers. Use of the platform isillustrated through a practical example, which allows a user'scurrent working desktop to follow them as they move aroundthe environment.IntroductionThe essence of mobile computing is that a user's applicationsare available, in a suitably adapted form, wherever thatuser goes.

Title: Measuring Bandwidth
Abstract: Accurate network bandwidth measurement is important to a variety ofnetwork applications. Unfortunately, accurate bandwidth measurementis difficult. We describe some current bandwidth measurementtechniques: using throughput, pathchar [8], and Packet Pair [2]. Weexplain some of the problems with these techniques, including pooraccuracy, poor scalability, lack of statistical robustness, pooragility in adapting to bandwidth changes, lack of flexibility indeployment, and inaccuracy when used on a variety of traffic types.Our solutions to these problems include using a packet window toadapt quickly to bandwidth changes, Receiver Only Packet Pair tocombine accuracy and ease of deployment, and Potential BandwidthFiltering to increase accuracy. Our techniques are are at least asaccurate as previously used filtering algorithms, and in somesituations, our techniques are more than 37% more accurate.

Title: Enhancing Throughput over Wireless LANs Using Channel State Dependent Packet Scheduling
Abstract: In recent years, a variety of mobile computers equipped with wirelesscommunication deviceshave become popular. These computers use applications and protocols,originally developed forwired desktop hosts, to communicate over wireless channels. Unlikewired networks, packetstransmitted on wireless channels are often subject to burst errorswhich cause back to backpacket losses. In this paper we study the effect of burst packeterrors and error recovery mechanismsemployed in wireless MAC protocols on performance of transportprotocols such as TCP.Most wireless LAN link layer protocols recover from packet losses byretransmitting lost segments.When wireless channel is in burst error state, most retransmissionattempts fail, therebycausing poor utilization of the wireless channel. Furthermore, in theevent of multiple sessionssharing a wireless link, FIFO packet scheduling can cause the HOLblocking resulting in unfairsharing of the bandwidth. This observation leads to a new clas...

Title: The Case for Wireless Overlay Networks
Abstract: Wireless data services, other than those for electronic mail orpaging, have thus far been more promising than successful. We believethat future mobile information systems must be built uponheterogeneous wireless overlay networks', extending traditional wiredandinternetworked processing "islands" to hosts on the moveover coverage areas ranging from in-room, in-building, campus,metropolitan,and wide-areas. Unfortunately, network planners continue to think interms of homogeneous wireless communications systemsand technologies. In this paper, we describe a new wireless datanetworking architecture that integrates diverse wireless technologiesinto a seamless internetwork. In addition, we describe theapplications support services needed to make it possible forapplicationsto continue to operate as mobile hosts roam across such networks. Thearchitecture described herein is being implemented in a testbedat the University of California, Berkeley under jointgovernment/industry sponsorship.

Title: A Dynamic Disk Spin-Down Technique for Mobile Computing
Abstract: We address the problem of deciding when to spin downthe disk of a mobile computer in order to extend batterylife. Since one of the most critical resources inmobile computing environments is battery life, goodenergy conservation methods can dramatically increasethe utility of mobile systems. We use a simple and efficientalgorithm based on machine learning techniquesthat has excellent performance in practice. Our experimentalresults are based on traces collected from HPC2474s disks. Using this data, the algorithm outperformsseveral algorithms that are theoretically optimalin under various worst-case assumptions, as well as thebest fixed time-out strategy. In particular, the algorithmreduces the power consumption of the disk toabout half (depending on the disk's properties) of theenergy consumed by a one minute fixed time-out. Sincethe algorithm adapts to usage patterns, it uses as littleas 88% of the energy consumed by the best fixedtime-out computed in retrospect.1 In...

Due to its localized nature, thisprotocol proves to be self-reconfiguring and staysclose to the minimum energy solution when appliedto mobile networks.

Title: Protocols for adaptive wireless and mobile networking
Abstract: this article, we give a status report of our current work in theMonarch Project, placing it in thecontext of broader efforts by the Internet mobile networkingcommunity.Our work will enable mobile hosts to communicate with each other andwith stationary or wiredhosts, transparently making the most efficient use of the bestnetwork connectivity available to the mobilehost at any time. To this end, the networking protocols must supportadaptive operation in a number ofways. For example, host mobility means that protocols must be able toadapt packet routing to reacheach mobile host in its current location. In addition, differentwireless networks, intended for examplefor local-area, metropolitan-area, and wide-area use, make differenttradeoffs in factors such as bandwidth,latency, error rate, and usage cost, providing different levels ofquality of network connection with eachwireless networking product or service. Network protocols should beable to adapt to optimize use of thebest available network connection for each mobile host at any time.Further, in order to allow higher-layerprotocols and applications to adapt to these changes in networkconnection quality, network protocols shouldbe able to provide information to higher layers when such changestake place.We are experimenting with our protocols in the context of the"Wireless Andrew" infrastructure,currentlybeing built at Carnegie Mellon [10]. The Wireless Andrewinfrastructure builds on the current wired networkinfrastructure on campus, consisting mostly of 10-megabit per secondEthernet equipment. For high-speedwireless access on campus, we are installing an AT&T WaveLANnetwork covering most of the campusbuildings [32].

Seer is a system that usessemantic information to predict which files the user islikely to work on, and arranges to transparently cachethem on the portable platform prior to disconnection.We present the overall design of the Seer system andthe algorithms used to determine semantic relationships.1 IntroductionMost modern computing environments dependheavily on resources that are retrieved via networks.However, despite recent advances in wireless networking,portable computers do not normally have accessto the same rich communication capabilities that areavailable to desktop machines. Portable computersfrequently operate without a network, or connectedonly via a low-bandwidth, high-cost link that must beused sparingly.In such situations, the portable machine must createcopies of important files in a locally persistent (ondisk)cache while it i...

Title: Adaptive Data Broadcast in Hybrid Networks
Abstract: With the immense popularity of the Web,the worldis witnessing an unprecedented demand for dataservices. At the same time, the Internet is evolvingtowards an information super-highway that incorporatesa wide mixture of existing and emergingcommunication technologies, including wireless,mobile, and hybrid networking. Taking advantageof these new technologies, we are proposing a hybridscheme which effectively combines broadcastfor massive data dissemination and unicast for individualdata delivery. In this paper, we describe atechnique that uses the broadcast medium for storageof frequently requested data, and an algorithmthat continuously adapts the broadcast content tomatch the hot-spot of the database. We show thatthe hot-spot can be accurately obtained by monitoringthe "broadcast misses" observed throughdirect requests. This is a departure from otherbroadcast-based systems which rely on efficientscheduling based on precompiled user profiles.We also show that the pro...

Abstract: this paper, the exact method by which the look-up table is generatedis not important.In this section we are interested in the updates to the routingtables at each PBS in theK. Y. Eng et al. / A Wireless Broadband Ad-Hoc ATM Local-Area Network17case of a failure. A tree and a routing table is shown in Fig. 13.First, we would like to illustrate that in the case of a linkfailure, updating the routingtables at the affected transmitter node is not sufficient. This isshown in Fig. 14 for therouting tree of Fig. 13. When the affected PBS reroutes traffic asshown, a cycle isgenerated in the tree, since the traffic is deflected to a PBS thattransmits incoming cellsback to the affected PBS in accordance with the original treedesignation. Although froma simplicity viewpoint, regular deflection networking would bedesirable in this network,it does not work since deflection routing works well only fornetworks with regulartopologies, but for networks with arbitrary topologies, such as ours,it does not work.The optimum remedy to the problem is in calculating the optimum treeas if the failedlink were disconnected, and updating the routing tables at each PBS.Various centralizedor distributed algorithms exist for this purpose. Without gettinginto algorithm specifics,we describe centralized and distributed alternatives below.The first issue is the detection of failure. In the case of fullduplex links, the failure isdetected by both ends of the link failure. However, common failuresinvolve transmitterand receiver failures in the case of optical links, and it istherefore safe to conclude thatthe failures should be detected by the receiving PBS. The secondissue is the propagationof this information to the agent that will make the reroutingdecision. In ...

Title: A Mobile Host Protocol Supporting Route Optimization and Authentication
Abstract: Host mobility is becoming an important issue due to the recentproliferation of notebook andpalmtop computers, the development of wireless network interfaces,and the growth in globalinternetworking. This paper describes the design and implementationof a mobile host protocol,called the Internet Mobile Host Protocol (IMHP), that is compatiblewith the TCP/IP protocolsuite, and allows a mobile host to move around the Internet withoutchanging its identity. Inparticular, IMHP provides host mobility over both the local and widearea, while remainingtransparent to the user and to other hosts communicating with themobile host.IMHP features route optimization and integrated authentication of allmanagement packets.Route optimization allows a node to cache the location of a mobilehost and to send futurepackets directly to that mobile host. By authenticating allmanagement packets, IMHP guardsagainst possible attacks on packet routing to mobile hosts, includingthe interception or ...

Abstract: This paper summarizes the results of the BARWAN project, whichfocused on enabling truly useful mobile networking across anextremely wide variety of real-world networks and mobile devices. Wepresent the overall architecture, summarize key results, and discussfour broad lessons learned along the way. The architecture enablesseamless roaming in a single logical overlay network composed of manyheterogeneous (mostly wireless) physical networks, and providessignificantly better TCP performance for these networks. It alsoprovides complex scalable and highly available services to enablepowerful capabilities across a very wide range of mobile devices, andmechanisms for automated discovery and configuration of localizedservices. Four broad themes arose from the project: 1) the power ofdynamic adaptation as a generic solution to heterogeneity, 2) theimportance of cross-layer information, such as the exploitation ofTCP semantics in the link layer, 3) the use of agents in theinfrastructure to enable new abilities and to hide new problems fromlegacy servers and protocol stacks, and 4) the importance of softstate for such agents for simplicity, ease of fault recovery, andscalability.

Abstract: We consider a communication network shared by several selfish users.Each userseeks to optimize its own performance by controlling the routing ofits given flow demand,giving rise to a non-cooperative game. We investigate the Nashequilibrium ofsuch systems. For a two-node multiple-links system, uniqueness of theNash equilibriumis proved under reasonable convexity conditions. It is shown thatthis Nash equilibriumpoint possesses interesting monotonicity properties. For generalnetworks, these convexityconditions are not sufficient for guaranteeing uniqueness, and acounter exampleis presented. Nonetheless, uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium forgeneral topologies isestablished under various assumptions.

Title: Measurement and Analysis of the Error Characteristics of an In-Building Wireless Network
Abstract: There is general belief that networks based on wireless technologieshave much higher error rates than those based on more traditionaltechnologies such as optical fiber, coaxial cable, or twistedpair wiring.

Abstract: A program slice consists of the parts of a program that (potentially)affect thevalues computed at some point of interest, referred to as a slicingcriterion. The taskof computing program slices is called program slicing. The originaldefinition of aprogram slice was presented by Weiser in 1979. Since then, variousslightly differentnotions of program slices have been proposed, as well as a number ofmethods tocompute them. An important distinction is that between a static and adynamic slice.The former notion is computed without making assumptions regarding aprogram'sinput, whereas the latter relies on some specific test case.Procedures, arbitrary control flow, composite datatypes and pointers,and interprocesscommunication each require a specific solution. We classify staticand dynamicslicing methods for each of these features, and compare theiraccuracy and efficiency.Moreover, the possibilities for combining solutions for differentfeatures are investigated.We discuss...

Vienna Fortranis a languageextension of Fortran which provides the user with a wide range offacilitiesfor such mapping of data structures. In contrast to currentprogramming practice,programs in Vienna Fortran are written using global data references.Thus,the user has the advantages of a shared memory programming paradigmwhile explicitlycontrolling the data distribution. In this paper, we present thelanguagefeatures of Vienna Fortran for Fortran 77, together with examplesillustrating theuse of these features.Keywords: distributed-memory multiprocessor systems, numericalcomputation,data parallel algorithms, data distribution, alignment.The work described in this paper is being carried out as part of theresearch project "Virtual SharedMemory for Multiprocessor Systems with Distributed Memory"funded by the Austrian Research Foundatio...

Title: A Metaobject Protocol for C++
Abstract: This paper presents a metaobject protocol (MOP) for C . This MOP wasdesigned to bring the power of meta-programming to C programmers. Itavoids penalties on runtime performance by adopting a newmeta-architecture in which the metaobjects control the compilation ofprograms instead of being active during program execution. Thisallows the MOP to be used to implement libraries of efficient,transparent language extensions. 1 Introduction A metaobject protocol(MOP) is an object-oriented interface for programmers to customizethe behavior and implementation of programming languages and othersystem software. The usefulness of this kind of customizability hasbeen argued elsewhere[11, 9, 10], and interesting MOPs have beenincluded in languages such as Lisp[20], ABCL[21], and, to a lesserdegree, Smalltalk[6]. The goal of our work is to bring the power ofmetaprogramming to the more mainstream language C , while respectingtheir performance concerns in that community. This paper pr...

Title: SUIF: An Infrastructure for Research on Parallelizing and Optimizing Compilers
Abstract: Compiler infrastructures that support experimental research arecrucial to the advancement of high-performance computing. Newcompiler technology must be implemented and evaluated in the contextof a complete compiler, but developing such an infrastructurerequires a huge investment in time and resources. We have spent anumber of years building the SUIF compiler into a powerful, flexiblesystem, and we would now like to share the results of our efforts.SUIF consists of a small, clearly documented kernel and a toolkit ofcompiler passes built on top of the kernel. The kernel defines theintermediate representation, provides functions to access andmanipulate the intermediate representation, and structures theinterface between compiler passes. The toolkit currently includes Cand Fortran front ends, a loop-level parallelism and localityoptimizer, an optimizing MIPS back end, a set of compiler developmenttools, and support for instructional use.

Title: MediaBench: A Tool for Evaluating and Synthesizing Multimedia and Communicatons Systems
Abstract: Over the last decade, significant advances have been made incompilation technology for capitalizing on instruction-levelparallelism (ILP). The vast majority of ILP compilation research hasbeen conducted in the context of generalpurpose computing, and morespecifically the SPEC benchmark suite. At the same time, a number ofmicroprocessor architectures have emerged which have VLIW and SIMDstructures that are well matched to the needs of the ILP compilers.Most of these processors are targeted at embedded applications suchas multimedia and communications, rather than general-purposesystems. Conventional wisdom, and a history of hand optimization ofinner-loops, suggests that ILP compilation techniques are well suitedto these applications. Unfortunately, there currently exists a gapbetween the compiler community and embedded applications developers.This paper presents MediaBench, a benchmark suite that has beendesigned to fill this gap. This suite has been constructed through a...

Title: Compiling Polymorphism Using Intensional Type Analysis
Abstract: Types have been used to describe the size and shape of datastructures at compile time. In polymorphiclanguages or languages with abstract types, this is not possiblesince the types of some objectsare not known at compile time. Consequently, most implementations ofpolymorphic languages boxdata (i.e., represent an object as a pointer), leading toinefficiencies. We introduce a new compilationmethod for polymorphic languages that avoids the problems associatedwith boxing data.The fundamental idea is to relax the requirement that code selectionfor primitive, polymorphicoperations, such as pairing and projection, must be performed atcompile time. Instead, we allowsuch operations to defer code selection until link- or even run-timewhen the types of the valuesare known.

Title: Effective compiler support for predicated execution using the hyperblock
Abstract: Predicated execution is an effective technique for dealingwith conditional branches in application programs. However,there are several problems associated with conventionalcompiler support for predicated execution. First, all pathsof control are combined into a single path regardless of theirexecution frequency and size with conventional if-conversiontechniques. Second, speculative execution is difficult to combinewith predicated execution. In this paper, we proposethe use of a new structure, referred to as the hyperblock,to overcome these problems. The hyperblock is an efficientstructure to utilize predicated execution for both compiletimeoptimization and scheduling. Preliminary experimentalresults show that the hyperblock is highly effective for awide range of superscalar and VLIW processors.1 IntroductionSuperscalar and VLIW processors can potentially providelarge performance improvements over their scalar predecessorsby providing multiple data paths and function u...

Abstract: Optimizing compilers should produce efficient code even in thepresence of high-level language constructs. However, currentprogramming support systems are significantly lacking in theirability to analyze procedure calls.

Title: Improving register allocation for subscripted variables
Abstract: INTRODUCTIONBy the late 1980s, memory system performance and CPU performancehad already begun to diverge. This trend made effective useof the register file imperative for excellent performance. Althoughmost compilers at that time allocated scalar variables to registersusing graph coloring with marked success [12, 13, 14, 6], allocationof array values to registers only occurred in rare circumstancesbecause standard data-flow analysis techniques could not uncoverthe available reuse of array memory locations. This deficiency wasespecially problematic for scientific codes since a majority of thecomputation involves array references.Our original paper addressed this problem by presenting an algorithmand experiment for a loop transformation, called scalarreplacement, that exposed the reuse available in array references inan innermost loop. It also demonstrated experimentally how anotherloop transformation, called unroll-and-jam [2], could exposemore opportunities for scalar

Title: Lifetime-Sensitive Modulo Scheduling
Abstract: This paper shows how to software pipeline a loop for minimalregister pressure without sacrificing the loop's minimumexecution time. This novel bidirectional slack-schedulingmethod has been implemented in a FORTRAN compilerand tested on many scientific benchmarks. The empiricalresults---when measured against an absolute lower bound onexecution time, and against a novel schedule-independentabsolute lower bound on register pressure---indicate nearoptimalperformance.1 IntroductionSoftware pipelining increases a loop's throughput by overlappingthe loop's iterations; that is, by initiating successiveiterations before prior iterations complete. With sufficientoverlap, a functional unit can be saturated, at which point theloop initiates iterations at the maximum possible rate.To find an overlapped schedule, a compiler must representthe complex resource constraints that can arise. Efficientlyrepresenting these constraints is especially difficult when adjacentiterations do n...

Title: Optimization of Object-Oriented Programs Using Static Class Hierarchy Analysis

Optimizing compilers for object-oriented languages apply staticclass analysis and other techniques to try to deduce preciseinformation aboutthe possible classes of the receivers of messages; if successful,dynamicallydispatchedmessages can be replaced with direct procedure calls andpotentially further optimized through inline-expansion. By examiningthecomplete inheritance graph of a program, which we call classhierarchyanalysis, the compiler can improve the quality of static classinformation andthereby improve run-time performance. In this paper we present classhierarchy analysis and describe techniques for implementing thisanalysiseffectively in both statically- and dynamically-typed languages andalso inthe presence of multi-methods. We also discuss how class hierarchyanalysiscan be supported in an interactive programming environment and, tosomeextent, in the presence of separate compilation.

Title: Compiler Optimizations for Improving Data Locality
Abstract: In the past decade, processor speed has become significantly fasterthan memory speed. Small, fast cache memories are designed toovercome this discrepancy, but they are only effective when programsexhibit data locality. In this paper, we present compileroptimizations to improve data locality basedon a simple yet accuratecost model. The model computes both temporal and spatial reuse ofcache lines to find desirable loop organizations. The cost modeldrives the application of compound transformations consisting of looppermutation, loop fusion, loop distribution, and loop reversal. Wedemonstrate that these program transformations are useful foroptimizing many programs. To validate our optimization strategy, weimplemented our algorithms and ran experiments on a large collectionof scientific programs and kernels. Experiments with kernelsillustrate that our model and algorithm can select and achieve thebest performance. For over thirty complete applications, we executedthe origin...

Title: Optimizing ML with Run-Time Code Generation
Abstract: We describe the design and implementation of a compiler thatautomatically translates ordinaryprograms written in a subset of ML into code that generates nativecode at run time. Run-timecode generation can make use of values and invariants that cannot beexploited at compile time,yielding code that is superior to statically optimal code. But thecost of optimizing and generatingcode at run time can be prohibitive. We demonstrate how compile-timespecialization can reducethe cost of run-time code generation by an order of magnitude withoutgreatly affecting codequality. Several benchmark programs are examined, which exhibit anaverage cost of six cycles perinstruction generated at run time.The authors' electronic mail addresses are Mark.Leone@cs.cmu.edu andPeter.Lee@cs.cmu.edu.This research was sponsored in part by the Advanced Research ProjectsAgency CSTO under the title "The FoxProject: Advanced Langauges for Systems Software," ARPA OrderNo. C533, issued by ESC/ENS under...

Theadvantage of this approach is that it provides improvedapplication flexibility and performance; the disadvantageis that buggy or malicious code can jeopardize theintegrity of the kernel. It has been demonstrated that it isfeasible to use safe languages, software fault isolation,or virtual memory protection to safeguard the main kernel.However, such protection mechanisms do notaddress the full range of problems, such as resourcehoarding, that can arise when application code is introducedinto the kernel.In this paper, we present an analysis of extensionmechanisms in the VINO kernel.

JavaParty transparently adds remoteobjects to Java purely by declaration while avoiding disadvantages ofexplicit socket communication, the programming overhead of RMI, andmany disadvantages of the message-passing approach in general.JavaParty is specifically targeted towards and implemented onclusters of workstations. It hence combines Java-like programming andthe concepts of distributed shared memory in heterogeneous networks.

Title: Implementation of a Portable Nested Data-Parallel Language
Abstract: This paper gives an overview of the implementation of NESL, aportable nested data-parallellanguage. This language and its implementation are the first to fullysupport nested data structuresas well as nested data-parallel function calls. These features allowthe concise description of parallelalgorithms on irregular data, such as sparse matrices and graphs. Inaddition, they maintain theadvantages of data-parallel languages: a simple programming model andportability. The currentNESL implementation is based on an intermediate language called VCODEand a library of vectorroutines called CVL. It runs on the Connection Machines CM-2 andCM-5, the Cray Y-MP C90,and serial workstations. We compare initial benchmark results of NESLwith those of machinespecificcode on these machines for three algorithms: least-squaresline-fitting, median finding,and a sparse-matrix vector product. These results show that NESL'sperformance is competitivewith that of machine-specific codes for regular dense data, and isoften superior for irregular data.

Title: Type-Directed Partial Evaluation
Abstract: We present a strikingly simple partial evaluator, that istypedirectedand reifies a compiled program into the text of a residual,specialized program. Our partial evaluator is concise(a few lines) and it handles the flagship examples of offlinemonovariant partial evaluation. Its source programs areconstrained in two ways: they must be closed and monomorphicallytypable. Thus dynamic free variables need tobe factored out in a "dynamic initial environment".Typedirectedpartial evaluation uses no symbolic evaluation forspecialization, and naturally processes static computationaleffects.Our partial evaluator is the part of an offline partial evaluatorthat residualizes static values in dynamic contexts. Itsrestriction to the simply typed lambda-calculus coincideswith Berger and Schwichtenberg's "inverse of the evaluationfunctional" (LICS'91), which is an instance of normalizationin a logical setting. As such, type-directed partial evaluationessentially achieves lambda-calculu...

Title: Reducing Indirect Function Call Overhead in C++ Programs
Abstract: Modern computer architectures increasingly depend on mechanisms thatestimate future control flow decisions to increase performance.Mechanisms such as speculative execution and prefetching are becomingstandard architectural mechanisms that rely oncontrol flow predictionto prefetch and speculatively execute future instructions. At thesame time, computer programmers are increasingly turning toobject-oriented languages to increase their productivity. Theselanguages commonly use run time dispatching to implement objectpolymorphism. Dispatching is usually implemented using an indirectfunction call, which presents challenges to existing control flowprediction techniques. We have measured the occurrence of indirectfunction calls in a collection of C++ programs. We show that,although it is more important to predict branchesaccurately, indirectcall prediction is also an important factor in some programs and willgrow in importance with the growth of object-oriented programming.We...

We havedeveloped the firstcompiler system that fully automatically parallelizes sequentialprograms and changes the original array layouts to improve memorysystem performance. Our optimization algorithm consists of two steps.The first step chooses the parallelization and computation assignmentsuch that synchronization and data sharing are minimized.

In addition to usingnatural loop analysis to predictbranches that control the iteration of loops, we focus on heuristicsfor predicting non-loopbranches, which dominate the dynamic branch count of many programs.The heuristics are simpleand require little program analysis, yet they are effective in termsof coverage and miss rate.Although program-based prediction does not equal the accuracy ofprofile-based prediction, webelieve it reaches a sufficiently high level to be useful.

Title: Reducing memory latency via non-blocking and prefetching caches
Abstract: Non-blocking caches and prefetching caches are two techniques forhiding memory latency by exploiting the overlap of processorcomputations with data accesses. A non-blocking cache allowsexecution to proceed concurrently with cache misses as long asdependency constraints are observed, thus exploiting post-missoperations. A prefetching cache generates prefetch requests to bringdata in the cache before it is actually needed, thus allowing overlapwith pre-miss computations. In this paper, we evaluate theeffectiveness of these two hardware-based schemes. We propose ahybrid design based on the combination of these approaches. We alsoconsider compiler-based optimizations to enhance the effectiveness ofnon-blocking caches. Results from instruction level simulations onthe SPEC benchmarks show that the hardware prefetching cachesgenerally outperform non-blocking caches. Also, the relativeeffectiveness of non-blocking caches is more adversely affected by anincrease in memory latency...

Abstract: We have developed a system called OM to explore the problem of codeoptimization at link-time. OM takes a collection of object modulesconstituting the entire program, and converts the object code into asymbolic Register Transfer Language (RTL) form that can be easilymanipulated. This RTL is then transformed by intermodule optimizationand finally converted back into object form. Although much high-levelinformation about the program is gone at link-time, this approachenables us to perform optimizations that a compiler looking at asingle module cannot see. Since object modules are more or lessindependent of the particular source language or compiler, this alsogives us the chance to improve the code in ways that some compilersmight simply have missed. To test the concept, we have used OM tobuild an optimizer that does interprocedural code motion. It movessimple loop-invariant code out of loops, even when the loop bodyextends across many procedures and the loop control is in a ...

Abstract: This paper presents a Parameter based Performance PredictionTool (P3T ) which is part of the Vienna Fortran CompilationSystem (VFCS), a compiler that automatically translatesFortran programs into message passing programs formassively parallel architectures.The P3T is applied to an explicitly parallel program generatedby the VFCS, which may contain synchronous aswell as asynchronous communication and is attributed withparameters computed in a previous profiling run. It staticallycomputes a set of optional parameters that characterizethe behavior of the parallel program. This includes workdistribution, the number of data transfers, the amount ofdata transferred, transfer times, network contention, andthe number of cache misses. These parameters can be selectivelydetermined for statements, loops, procedures, andthe entire program; furthermore, their effect with respect toindividual processors can be examined.The tool plays an important role in the VFCS by providin...

Title: Register Allocation with Instruction Scheduling: A New Approach
Abstract: We present a new framework in which considerations of both registerallocation and instruction scheduling can be applied uniformly andsimultaneously. In this framework an optimal coloring of a graph,called the parallelizable interference graph, provides an optimalregister allocation and preserves the property that no falsedependences are introduced, thus all the options for parallelism arekept for the scheduler to handle. For this framework we provideheuristics for trading off parallel scheduling with registerspilling.

Title: A Linear Algebra Framework for Static HPF Code Distribution
Abstract: High Performance Fortran (hpf) was developedto support data parallel programming for simdand mimd machines with distributed memory. Theprogrammer is provided a familiar uniform logic addressspace and specifies the data distribution by directives.The compiler then exploits these directivesto allocate arrays in the local memories, to assigncomputations to elementary processors and to migratedata between processors when required. Weshow here that linear algebra is a convenient frameworkto encode hpf directives and to synthesize distributedcode with space-efficient array allocation,tight loop bounds and minimal communications forINDEPENDENT loops. The systematic use of an affineframework makes it easy to prove the compilationscheme correct. The generated code includes traditionaloptimizations such as guard elimination, messagevectorization, and aggregation, overlap analysis,...1 IntroductionDistributed memory multiprocessors can be usedefficiently if each local memo...

Title: Compiler-Based Prefetching for Recursive Data Structures
Abstract: Software-controlled data prefetching offers the potential forbridging the ever-increasing speed gap between the memory subsystemand today's high-performance processors. While prefetching hasenjoyed considerable success in array-based numeric codes, itspotential in pointer-based applications has remained largelyunexplored. This paper investigates compilerbased prefetching forpointer-based applications---in particular, those containingrecursive data structures. We identify the fundamental problem inprefetching pointer-based data structures and propose a guideline fordevising successful prefetching schemes. Based on this guideline, wedesign three prefetching schemes, we automate the most widelyapplicable scheme (greedy prefetching) in an optimizing researchcompiler, and we evaluate the performance of all three schemes on amodern superscalar processor similar to the MIPS R10000. Our resultsdemonstrate that compiler-inserted prefetching can significantlyimprove the execution...

Title: Implementing Multiple Protection Domains in Java
Abstract: Safe language technology can be used for protection within a singleaddress space. This protectionis enforced by the language's type system, which ensures thatreferences to objects cannot beforged. A safe language alone, however, lacks many features taken forgranted in more traditionaloperating systems, such as rights revocation, thread protection,resource management, and supportfor domain termination. This paper describes the J-Kernel, a portableJava-based protection systemthat addresses these issues. A number of micro-benchmarks arepresented to characterize the costsof language-based protection, and an extensible web server based onthe J-Kernel demonstrates theuse of safe language techniques in a large application.1 IntroductionTraditional operating systems use virtual memory to enforceprotection between processes. A processcannot directly read and write other processes' memory, andcommunication between processes requirestraps to the kernel. In the past decade ...

Title: Generating Communication for Array Statements: Design, Implementation, and Evaluation
Abstract: Array statements as included in Fortran 90 or High PerformanceFortran (HPF) are a wellaccepted way to specify data parallelism inprograms. When generating code for such a data parallel program for aprivate memory parallel system, the compiler must determine whenarray elements must be moved from one processor to another. Thispaper describes a practical method to compute the set of arrayelements that are to be moved; it covers all the distributions thatare included in HPF: block, cyclic, and block-cyclic. This method isthe foundation for an efficient protocol for modern private memoryparallel systems: for each block of data to be sent, the senderprocessor computes the local address in the receiver's address space,and the address is then transmitted together with the data. Thisstrategy increases the communication load but reduces the overhead onthe receiving processor. We implemented this optimization in anexperimental Fortran compiler, and this paper reports an empiricalev...

It is smallerand faster than generally available alternatives, and its local codeiscomparable. This report describes the interface between thetargetindependentfront end and the target-dependent back ends. Theinterface consists of shared data structures, a few functions, and adag language.

Title: Using Profile Information to Assist Classic Code Optimizations
Abstract: This paper describes the design and implementation of an optimizingcompiler that automatically generates profile information to assistclassic code optimizations. This compiler contains two newcomponents, an execution profiler and a profile-based code optimizer,which are not commonly found in traditional optimizing compilers. Theexecution profiler inserts probes into the input program, executesthe input program for several inputs, accumulates profileinformation, and supplies this information to the optimizer. Theprofile-based code optimizer uses the profile information to exposenew optimization opportunities that are not visible to traditionalglobal optimization methods. Experimental results show that theprofile-based code optimizer significantly improves the performanceof production C programs that have already been optimized by ahigh-quality global code optimizer. Key Words: C, code optimization,compiler, profile-based code optimization, profiler INTRODUCTION Themajor objective of code optimizations is to reduce the executiontime. Some classic code optimizations, such as dead code elimination,common subexpression elimination, and copy propagation, reduce theexecution time by removing redundant computation. Other codeoptimizations, such as loop invariant code removal and loop inductionvariable elimination, reduce the execution time by movinginstructions from frequently executed program regions to infrequentlyexecuted program regions. This paper describes an optimizing compilerthat accurately identifies frequently executed program paths andoptimizes them.

Abstract: This paper presents a general framework for determining averageprogram execution times and their variance, based on the program'sinterval structure and control dependence graph. Average executiontimes and variance values are computed using frequency informationfrom an optimized counter-based execution profile of the program. 1Introduction It is important for a compiler to obtain estimates ofexecution times for subcomputations of an input program, if it is toattempt optimizations related to overhead values in the targetarchitecture. In earlier work [SH86a, SH86b, Sar87, Sar89], we usedestimates of execution times to facilitate the automatic partitioningand scheduling of programs written in the singleassignment language,Sisal, for parallel execution on multiprocessors.

Title: Automatic Data Layout Using 0-1 Integer Programming
Abstract: : The goal of languages like Fortran D or HPF is to provide a simpleyet efficient machineindependentparallel programming model. By shifting much of the burden ofmachine-dependentoptimization to the compiler, the programmer is able to writedata-parallel programs that canbe compiled and executed with good performance on many differentarchitectures. However, thechoice of a good data layout is still left to the programmer. Eventhe most sophisticated compilerwill not be able to compensate for a poorly chosen data layout sincemany compiler optimizationsare driven by the data layout specified in the program.The choice of a good data layout depends on many factors, includingthe target machine architecture,the compilation system, the problem size, and the number ofprocessors available. Theoption of remapping arrays at specific points in the program makesthe choice even harder. Currentprogramming tools provide little or no support for this difficultselection process.This pap...

Title: Dependent Types in Practical Programming
Abstract: Programming is a notoriously error-prone process, and a great deal ofevidence in practice has demonstrated that the use of a type systemin a programming language can effectively detect program errors atcompile-time. Moreover, some recent studies have indicated that theuse of types can lead to significant enhancement of programperformance at run-time. For the sake of practicality oftype-checking, most type systems developed for general purposeprogramming languages tend to be simple and coarse, and this leavesample room for improvement. As an advocate of types, this thesisaddresses the issue of designing a type system for practicalprogramming in which a notion of dependent types is available,leading to more accurate capture of program invariants with types. Incontrast to developing a type theory with dependent types and thendesigning upon it a functional programming language, we studypractical methods for extending the type systems of existingprogramming languages with dep...

Abstract: Induction variable detection is usually closely tied to the strengthreduction optimization. This paper studies induction variableanalysis from a different perspective, that of finding inductionvariables for data dependence analysis. While classical inductionvariable analysis techniques have been used successfully up to now,we have found a simple algorithm based on the the Static SingleAssignment form of a program that finds all linear inductionvariables in a loop. Moreover, this algorithm is easily extended tofind induction variables in multiple nested loops, to find nonlinearinduction variables, and to classify other integer scalar assignmentsin loops, such as monotonic, periodic and wraparound variables. Someof these other variables are now classified using ad hoc patternrecognition, while others are not analyzed by current compilers.Giving a unified approach improves the speed of compilers and allowsa more general classification scheme. We also show how to use theseva...

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework for automaticallypartitioning parallel loops to minimize cache coherency traffic onshared-memory multiprocessors.

Our paper solves this openproblem by presenting a method for deriving an optimalhyperparallelepiped tiling of iteration spaces for minimalcommunication in multiprocessors with caches. We show that the sametheoretical framework can also be used to determine optimal tilingparameters for both data and loop partitioning in distributed memorymulticomputers. Our framework uses matrices to represent iterationand data space mappings and the notion of uniformly intersectingreferences to capture temporal locality in array references.

Unfortunately, dynamicdispatching imposes a runtime performance penalty.

Abstract: With the widening performance gap between processors and main memory,efficient memory accessing behavior is necessary for good programperformance. Both hand-tuning and compiler optimization techniquesare often used to transform codes to improve memory performance.Effective transformations require detailed knowledge about thefrequency and causes of cache misses in the code. This paperdescribes methods for generating and solving Cache Miss equationsthat give a detailed representation of the cache misses inloop-oriented scientific code. Implemented within the SUIF compilerframework, our approach extends on traditional compiler reuseanalysis to generate linear Diophantine equations that summarize eachloop's memory behavior.

Title: Simple and Effective Link-Time Optimization of Modula-3 Programs
Abstract: this paper, we describe the opportunities for link-time optimizationof Modula-3 and present two link-time optimization techniques.Data-driven simplification is a new technique. It uses a program'stype hierarchy to recover completely the cost of opaque types and toreduce the runtime overhead of methods. It also reveals otheropportunities for optimization, such as constant and type propagationand procedure inlining and cloning. Profile-driven optimization usesprofile data to identify and transform those procedures that canbenefit most from optimizations made possible by data-drivensimplification. Moreover, our techniques make it as easy to optimizeprocedures in libraries as to optimize those in applications.Data-driven simplification and profile-driven optimization differfrom other link-time optimizations because they require high-leveldata, e.g., the types of objects and expressions, that are necessaryfor applying our techniques but often missing from object code. Bothoptimizations require the entire program to be available andtherefore cannot be applied at compile time. They are also machineindependent and therefore are best applied to an intermediaterepresentation before code generation. An intermediate representationalso simplifies recognition of idiomatic expressions generated by theModula-3 compiler. The compiler generates intermediate-code idioms tocreate objects, to access fields of opaque objects, and to invokemethods. Often, these idioms can be recognized and simplified.Identifying idiomatic expressions would be difficult for atraditional linker presented with object code that has been reorderedby instruction scheduling or that does not carry enough typeinformation.

Abstract: As the gap between memory and processor speeds continues to widen,cache efficiency is an increasingly important component of processorperformance. Compiler techniques have been used to improveinstruction cache performance by mapping code with temporal localityto different cache blocks in the virtual address space eliminatingcache conflicts. These code placement techniques can be applieddirectly to the problem of placing data for improved data cacheperformance. In this paper we present a general framework for CacheConscious Data Placement. This is a compiler directed approach thatcreates an address placement for the stack (local variables), globalvariables, heap objects, and constants in order to reduce data cachemisses. The placement of data objects is guided by a temporalrelationship graph between objects generated via profiling. Ourresults show that profile driven data placement significantly reducesthe data miss rate by 24% on average. 1 Introduction Much effort hasb...

We then show how forwardand backward dataflow analyses can be performed efficiently on theDFG, using constant propagation and elimination of partialredundancies as examples. These analyses can be framed as solutionsof dataflow equations in the DFG. Our construction algorithm is ofindependent interest because it can be used to construct a program'scontrol dependence graph in O(E) time and its SSA representation inO(EV ) time, which are improvements over existing algorithms. 1Introduction Anumber of recent papers have focused attention on theproblem of speeding up program optimization [FOW87, BMO90, CCF91, PBJ+ 91, CFR +...

Abstract: Current research in compiler optimization counts mainlyCPU time and perhaps the first cache level or two. Thisview has been important but is becoming myopic, at leastfrom a system-wide viewpoint, as the ratio of network anddisk speeds to CPU speeds grows exponentially.For example, we have seen the CPU idle for most of thetime during paging, so compressing pages can increasetotal performance even though the CPU must decompressor interpret the page contents.

Title: Run-Time Adaptive Cache Hierarchy Management via Reference Analysis
Abstract: Improvements in main memory speeds have not kept pace with increasingprocessor clock frequency and improved exploitation ofinstruction-level parallelism. Consequently, the gap betweenprocessor and main memory performance is expected to grow, increasingthe number of execution cycles spent waiting for memory accesses tocomplete. One solution to this growing problem is to reduce thenumber of cache misses by increasing the effectiveness of the cachehierarchy. In this paper we present a technique for dynamic analysisof program data access behavior, which is then used to proactivelyguide the placement of data within the cache hierarchy in alocation-sensitive manner. We introduce the concept of a macroblock,which allows us to feasibly characterize the memory locationsaccessed by a program, and a Memory Address Table, which performs thedynamic reference analysis. Our technique is fully compatible withexisting Instruction Set Architectures. Results from detailedsimulations of sev...

Title: Space-Efficient Closure Representations
Abstract: Many modern compilers implement function calls (or returns)in two steps: first, a closure environment is properlyinstalled to provide access for free variables in the targetprogram fragment; second, the control is transferred to thetarget by a "jump with arguments (or results)." Closureconversion, which decides where and how to represent closuresat runtime, is a crucial step in compilation of functionallanguages. We have a new algorithm that exploits the useof compile-time control and data flow information to optimizeclosure representations. By extensive closure sharingand allocating as many closures in registers as possible, ournew closure conversion algorithm reduces heap allocationby 36% and memory fetches for local/global variables by43%; and improves the already-efficient code generated bythe Standard ML of New Jersey compiler by about 17% on aDECstation 5000. Moreover, unlike most other approaches,our new closure allocation scheme satisfies the strong "safefor sp...

Title: Interprocedural Compilation of Fortran D for MIMD Distributed-Memory Machines
Abstract: Algorithms exist for compiling Fortran D for MIMD distributed-memorymachines, but are significantly restricted in the presence ofprocedure calls. This paper presents interprocedural analysis,optimization, and code generation algorithms for Fortran D that limitcompilation to only one pass over each procedure. This isaccomplished by collecting summary information after edits, thencompiling procedures in reverse topological order to propagatenecessary information. Delaying instantiation of the computationpartition, communication, and dynamic data decomposition is key toenabling interprocedural optimization. Recompilation analysispreserves the benefits of separate compilation. Empirical resultsshow that interprocedural optimization is crucial in achievingacceptable performance for a common application. 1 IntroductionFortran D is an enhanced version of Fortran that allows the user tospecify data placement---the partitioning of data onto processors.Its goal is to provide a m...

Title: Flick: A Flexible, Optimizing IDL Compiler
Abstract: Interface definition language (IDL) compilers generate"stub functions" that provide separate communicatingprocesses with the abstraction of local object invocationor procedure call. Unfortunately, these compilers havenot kept pace with recent advances in fast network technologiesand component-based software design. TypicalIDL compilers do little optimization because theyassume that interprocess communication is an inherentbottleneck. Moreover, typical IDL compilers are "rigid"and limited to supporting only a single IDL, a fixedmapping onto a target language, and a narrow range ofdata encodings and transport mechanisms.Flick, our new IDL compiler, addresses these problems.Flick applies concepts from general programminglanguage compilers to bring both flexibility and optimizationto the domain of IDL compilation. Flick consistsof three distinct stages which manipulate and communicatethrough flexible intermediate representations.Through these representations Flick suppor...

Ourmethod is based on FactoredUse-Def (FUD) chains, a demand-driven representation of the popularStatic Single Assignment(SSA) form. In this form, strongly connected components of theassociated SSA graph correspondto sequences in the source program: we describe a simple yetefficient algorithm for detecting andclassifying these sequences.

Title: Approximation Techniques for Average Completion Time Scheduling
Abstract: We consider the problem of nonpreemptive scheduling to minimizeaverage (weighted) completion time, allowing for release dates,parallel machines, and precedence constraints. Recent work has led toconstant-factor approximations for this problem, based on solving apreemptive or linear programming relaxation and then using thesolution to get an ordering on the jobs. We introduce several newtechniques which generalize this basic paradigm. We use these ideasto obtain improved approximation algorithms for one-machinescheduling to minimize average completion time with release dates. Inthe process, we obtain an optimal randomized online algorithm for thesame problem that beats a lower bound for deterministic on-linealgorithms. We consider extensions to the case of parallel machinescheduling, and for this we introduce two new ideas: first, we showthat a preemptive one-machine relaxation is a powerful tool fordesigning parallel machine scheduling algorithms that simultaneouslyprodu...

The MDBMS interface (or mediator interface) that describesthis CIS could bedifferent from the union of the local interfaces, that describe eachlocal database. Inparticular, the mediator interface may be defined by semanticknowledge, that includesviews over particular local databases, integrity constraints, andknowledge about datareplication in local databases.

A reformulation algorithm exploits thissemantic knowledge,and performs semantic rewriting based on pattern-matching, to obtaina query onthe union of the local interfaces.

Abstract: Learning methods based on dynamic programming (DP) are receivingincreasing attention in artificial intelligence. Researchers haveargued that DP provides the appropriate basis for compiling planningresults into reactive strategies for real-time control, as well asfor learning such strategies when the system being controlled isincompletely known. We introduce an algorithm based on DP, which wecall Real-Time DP (RTDP), by which an embedded system can improve itsperformance with experience. RTDP generalizes Korf'sLearning-Real-Time-A* algorithm to problems involving uncertainty. Weinvoke results from the theory of asynchronous DP to prove that RTDPachieves optimal behavior in several different classes of problems.We also use the theory of asynchronous DP to illuminate aspects ofother DP-based reinforcement learning methods such as Watkins'Q-Learning algorithm.

HTML annotationsstructure the display of Web pages, but provide virtually no insightinto their content. Thus, thedesigners of intelligent Web agents need to address the followingquestions: (1) To what extentcan an agent understand information published at Web sites? (2) Isthe agent's understandingsufficient to provide genuinely useful assistance to users?

Title: Markov Games as a Framework for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Abstract: In the Markov decision process (MDP) formalizationof reinforcement learning, a single adaptiveagent interacts with an environment defined by aprobabilistic transition function. In this solipsisticview, secondary agents can only be part of theenvironment and are therefore fixed in their behavior.The framework of Markov games allowsus to widen this view to include multiple adaptiveagents with interacting or competing goals.This paper considers a step in this direction inwhich exactly two agents with diametrically opposedgoals share an environment. It describesa Q-learning-like algorithm for finding optimalpolicies and demonstrates its application to a simpletwo-player game in which the optimal policyis probabilistic.1 INTRODUCTIONNo agent lives in a vacuum; it must interact with other agentsto achieve its goals.

Title: Collaborative Plans for Complex Group Action
Abstract: The original formulation of SharedPlans (Grosz and Sidner, 1990a) wasdeveloped to providea model of collaborative planning in which it was not necessary forone agent to have intentions-totoward an act of a different agent. Unlike other contemporaneousapproaches (Searle, 1990), thisformulation provided for two agents to coordinate their activitieswithout introducing any notionof irreducible joint intentions. However, it only treated activitiesthat directly decomposed intosingle-agent actions, did not address the need for agents to committo their joint activity, and didnot adequately deal with agents having only partial knowledge of theway in which to performan action. This paper provides a revised and expanded version ofSharedPlans that addressesthese shortcomings. It also reformulates Pollack's definition ofindividual plans (Pollack, 1990)to handle cases in which a single agent has only partial knowledge;this reformulation mesheswith the definition of SharedPlans.

Abstract: Advances in network and processor technology have greatly changed thecommunication and computational power of local-area workstationclusters. However, operating systems still treat workstation clustersas a collection of loosely-connected processors, where eachworkstation acts as an autonomous and independent agent. Thisoperating system structure makes it difficult to exploit thecharacteristics of current clusters, such as low-latencycommunication, huge primary memories, and high-speed processors, inorder to improve the performance of cluster applications. This paperdescribes the design and implementation of global memory managementin a workstation cluster.

Title: Agent Tcl: A Flexible and Secure Mobile-Agent System
Abstract: An information agent manages all or a portion of a user's informationspace. The electronic resources in this space are often distributedacross a network and can contain tremendous quantities of data.Mobile agents provide efficient access to such resources and are apowerful tool for implementing information agents. A mobile agent isan autonomous program that can migrate from machine to machine in aheterogeneous network. By migrating to the location of a resource,the agent can access the resource efficiently even if networkconditions are poor or the resource has a low-level interface.Telescript is the best-known mobile-agent system. Telescript,however, requires the programmer to learn and work with a complexobject-oriented language and a complex security model. Agent Tcl, onthe other hand, is a simple, flexible, and secure system that isbased on the Tcl scripting language and the Safe Tcl extension.

Abstract: Interface agents are semi-intelligent systems which assist users withdaily computer-based tasks. Recently, various researchers haveproposed a learning approach towards building such agents and someworking prototypes have been demonstrated. Such agents learn by`watching over the shoulder' of the user and detecting patterns andregularities in the user's behavior. Despite the successes booked, amajor problem with the learning approach is that the agent has tolearn from scratch and thus takes some time becoming useful.Secondly, the agent's competence is necessarily limited to actions ithas seen the user perform. Collaboration between agents assistingdifferent users can alleviate both of these problems.

A protocolthat allows such choices through conditionalcommitment breaking penalties is presented.Next, the implications of bounded rationalityare analyzed. Several tradeoffs betweenallocated computation and negotiationbenefits and risk are enumerated, and the necessityof explicit local deliberation control issubstantiated. Techniques for linking negotiationitems and multiagent contracts are presentedas methods for escaping local optima inthe task allocation process.

Abstract: Many AI researchers are today striving to build agent teams forcomplex, dynamicmulti-agent domains, with intended applications in arenas such aseducation, training,entertainment, information integration, and collective robotics.Unfortunately, uncertaintiesin these complex, dynamic domains obstruct coherent teamwork. Inparticular, teammembers often encounter differing, incomplete, and possiblyinconsistent views of their environment.Furthermore, team members can unexpectedly fail in fulfillingresponsibilitiesor discover unexpected opportunities. Highly flexible coordinationand communication iskey in addressing such uncertainties. Simply fitting individualagents with precomputedcoordination plans will not do, for their inflexibility can causesevere failures in teamwork,and their domain-specificity hinders reusability.Our central hypothesis is that the key to such flexibility andreusability is providingagents with general models of teamwork.

In addition tocontinuous feedback,T-R programs support parameter binding and recursion. A primarydifference betweenT-R programs and many other circuit-based systems is that thecircuitry of T-R programsis more compact; it is constructed at run time and thus does not haveto anticipate allthe contingencies that might arise over all possible runs. Inaddition, T-R programs areintuitive and easy to write and are written in a form that iscompatible with automaticplanning and learning methods.

Title: Itinerant Agents for Mobile Computing
Abstract: This paper describes an abstract framework for itinerant agents thatcan be used to implement secure, remote applications in large, publicnetworks such as the Internet or the IBM Global Network. Itinerantagents are programs, dispatched from a source computer, that roamamong a set of networked servers until they accomplish their task.This is an extension to the client / server model in which the clientsends a portion of itself to the server for execution. An additionalfeature of itinerant agents is their ability to migrate from serverto server, perhaps seeking one that can help with the user's task orperhaps collecting information from all of them. A major focus of thepaper is the Agent Meeting Point, an abstraction that supports theinteraction of agents with each other and server based resources. Whyis this extended form of client-server computing desirable orvaluable? There are many detailed motivations for using itinerantagents [6]. They fall broadly into two categories: 1) support formobile computers or lightweight devices and 2) the emerging need inrapidly evolving networks for an asynchronous method of searching forinformation or transaction services. For example: 1. The reduction ofoverall communication traffic over the low-bandwidth, high-latency,high-cost access networks typically employed by mobile computers. 2.The ability of the agent to engage in high-bandwidth communication(with a server, for example) to search through large, free textdatabases. 3. The ability of lightweight mobile computers to interactwith heavyweight applications without prior, detailed knowledge ofthe remote server's capabilities. 4. The ability of the agent tointegrate knowledge from the client and server and performinferencing at the server. 5. The ability of th...

However, theoveruse of the word `agent' has tended to mask the fact that, inreality, there is a truly heterogeneous body of research beingcarried out under this banner. This overview paper presents atypology of agents. Next, it places agents in context, defines themand then goes on, inter alia, to overview critically the rationales,hypotheses, goals, challenges and state-of-the-art demonstrators ofthe various agent types in our typology.

Title: Designing a Family of Coordination Algorithms
Abstract: Many researchers have shown that there is no single best organizationor coordination mechanism for all environments. This paper discussesthe design and implementation of an extendable family of coordinationmechanisms, called Generalized Partial Global Planning (GPGP). Theset of coordination mechanisms described here assists in schedulingactivities for teams of cooperative computational agents. The GPGPapproach has several unique features. First, it is not tied to asingle domain. Each mechanism is defined as a response to certainfeatures in the current task environment. We show that differentcombinations of mechanisms are appropriate for different taskenvironments. Secondly, the approach works in conjunction with anagent's existing local planner/scheduler. Finally, the initial set offive mechanisms presented here generalizes and extends the PartialGlobal Planning (PGP) algorithm. In comparison to PGP, GPGP schedulestasks with deadlines, it allows agent heterogeneity, it ex...

Title: Learning to Coordinate without Sharing Information
Abstract: Researchers in the field of Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI)have been developing efficient mechanisms to coordinate theactivities of multiple autonomous agents. The need for coordinationarises because agents have to share resources and expertise requiredto achieve their goals. Previous work in the area includes usingsophisticated information exchange protocols, investigatingheuristics for negotiation, and developing formal models ofpossibilities of conflict and cooperation among agent interests. Inorder to handle the changing requirements of continuous and dynamicenvironments, we propose learning as a means to provide additionalpossibilities for effective coordination. We use reinforcementlearning techniques on a block pushing problem to show that agentscan learn complimentary policies to follow a desired path without anyknowledge about each other. We theoretically analyze andexperimentally verify the effects of learning rate on systemconvergence, and demonstrat...

Title: Middle-Agents for the Internet
Abstract: Like middle-men in physical commerce, middleagentssupport the flow of information in electroniccommerce, assisting in locating and connecting theultimate information provider with the ultimate informationrequester. Many different types of middleagentswill be useful in realistic, large, distributed,open multi-agent problem solving systems. Theseinclude matchmakers or yellow page agents that processadvertisements, blackboard agents that collect requests,and brokers that process both. The behaviorsof each type of middle-agent have certain performancecharacteristics---privacy, robustness, andadaptiveness qualities---that are related to characteristicsof the external environment and of the agentsthemselves. For example, while brokered systems aremore vulnerable to certain failures, they are also ableto cope more quickly with a rapidly fluctuating agentworkforce and meet certain privacy considerations.This paper identifies a spectrum of middle-agents,characterizes the beha...

Title: Communication in Reactive Multiagent Robotic Systems
Abstract: Multiple cooperating robots are able to complete many tasks morequickly and reliably than one robot alone. Communication between therobots can multiply their capabilities and effectiveness, but to whatextent? In this research, the importance of communication in roboticsocieties is investigated through experiments on both simulated andreal robots. Performance was measured for three different types ofcommunication for three different tasks. The levels of communicationare progressively more complex and potentially more expensive toimplement. For some tasks, communication can significantly improveperformance, but for others inter-agent communication is apparentlyunnecessary. In cases where communication helps, the lowest level ofcommunication is almost as effective as the more complex type. Thebulk of these results are derived from thousands of simulations runwith randomly generated initial conditions. The simulation resultshelp determine appropriate parameters for the reac...

Title: Multiagent Systems: A Survey from a Machine Learning Perspective
Abstract: Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) has existed as a subfieldof AI for less than two decades. DAI is concerned with systems thatconsist of multiple independent entities that interact in a domain.Traditionally, DAI has been divided into two sub-disciplines:Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) focusses on the informationmanagement aspects of systems with several branches working togethertowards a common goal; Multiagent Systems (MAS) deals with behaviormanagement in collections of several independent entities, or agents.This survey of MAS is intended to serve as an introduction to thefield and as an organizational framework. A series of increasinglycomplex general multiagent scenarios are presented. For eachscenario, the issues that arise are described along with a samplingof the techniques that exist to deal with them. The presentedtechniques are not exhaustive, but they highlight how multiagentsystems can be and have been used to build complex systems. Whenoptions exi...

Abstract: The paper describes the results of the evolutionary development of areal, neural-network driven mobile robot. The evolutionary approachto the development of neural controllers for autonomous agents hasbeen successfully used by many researchers, but most-if not all-studies have been carried out with computer simulations. Instead, inthis research the whole evolutionary process takes places entirely ona real robot without human intervention. Although the experimentsdescribed here tackle a simple task of navigation and obstacleavoidance, we show a number of emergent phenomena that arecharacteristic of autonomous agents. The neural controllers of theevolved best individuals display a full exploitation of non-linearand recurrent connections that make them more efficient thananalogous man-designed agents.

Abstract: Java has demonstrated the utility of type systems for mobile code,and in particulartheir use and implications for security.

In this paper we provide a typesystemfor mobile computation, that is, for computation that is continuouslyactivebefore and after movement.

Title: Programming languages for mobile code
Abstract: machine level: The Java Virtual Machine(JVM) is a language dependent abstract machinethat is close enough to Java that its object codecan be checked to respect the language semantics. Inaddition to these static (load-time) verifications, theJVM must implement dynamic checks to guaranteethe safety of the language. These are bounds checkingon array and string accesses, checking casts to a morespecific type, invoking methods on null pointers, etc.The Java language, as described, is a modern `safe'language, guaranteeing that type and access rules arealways respected. This in turn enables a low-levelsecurity policy to be expressed within the languageitself. The visibility rules for classes and attributesplay a crucial role to this respect. Indeed, the interfaceto local resources is provided by libraries, protectedby the scope and visibility rules. Most resourcesrequiring dynamic access control, such as thefile system or access to the network, are controlledby a centralized security monitor, called the SecurityManager.The SecurityManager has an abstracttype, which cannot be instantiated by an applet. Allsecurity related methods are declared final, so thatapplications and applets are forced to use the approapriatecode. Without this protection, maliciousapplets could redefine the method in a subclass, potentiallycircumventing the security invariants. A final class enjoys even stronger protection, in that theinability to create subclasses also implies the inabilityto define new methods with access to protectedattributes.

Abstract: This paper describes a novel method of achieving load balancing intelecommunications networks. A simulated network models a typicaldistribution of calls between nodes; nodes carrying an excess oftraffic can become congested, causing calls to be lost. In additionto calls, the network also supports a population of simple mobileagents with behaviours modelled on the trail laying abilities ofants. The ants move across the network between randomly chosen pairsof nodes; as they move they deposit simulated pheromones as afunction of their distance from their source node, and the congestionencountered on their journey. They select their path at eachintermediate node according the distribution of simulated pheromonesat each node. Calls between nodes are routed as a function of thepheromone distributions at each intermediate node. The performance ofthe network is measured by the proportion of calls which are lost.The results of using the ant-based control (ABC) are compared withth...

Thus, it is notgenerally required that a user or agent know the identities,locations, or number of other agents involved in satisfying arequest. OAA is structured so as to minimize the effort involved increating new agents and "wrapping" legacy applications,written in various languages and operating on various platforms; toencourage the reuse of existing agents; and to allow for dynamism andflexibility in the makeup of agent communities.

Since cooperativerobotic teams usually work in dynamic and unpredictableenvironments, this software architecture allows therobot team members to respond robustly, reliably, flexibly,and coherently to unexpected environmental changes andmodifications in the robot team that may occur due to mechanicalfailure, the learning of new skills, or the additionor removal of robots from the team by human intervention.The feasibility of this architecture is demonstrated in animplementation on a team of mobile robots performing alaboratory version of hazardous waste cleanup.

Title: Informational Redundancy and Resource Bounds in Dialog
Abstract: INFORMATIONAL REDUNDANCY AND RESOURCE BOUNDS IN DIALOGUE Marilyn A.Walker Aravind K. Joshi and Ellen F. Prince (cosupervisors) Thisthesis investigates the relationship between language behavior andagents' resource bounds by examining the use of informationallyredundant utterances (IRUs) in problem-solving dialogues. The contentof an IRU is a proposition that the conversants already know or couldinfer. Since communication is a subcase of action, the existence ofIRUs is a paradox because IRUs appear to be actions whose effectshave already been achieved.

Title: The Safe-Tcl Security Model
Abstract: Safe-Tcl is a mechanism for controlling the execution of programswritten in the Tclscripting language. It allows untrusted scripts (applets) to beexecuted while preventingdamage to the environment or leakage of private information. Safe-Tcluses a padded cellapproach: each applet is isolated in a safe interpreter where itcannot interact directly withthe rest of the application. The execution environment of the safeinterpreter is controlledby trusted scripts running in a master interpreter. Safe-Tcl providesan alias mechanismthat allows applets to request services from the master interpreterin a controlled fashion.Safe-Tcl allows a variety of security policies to be implementedwithin a single application,and it supports both policies that authenticate incoming scripts andthose that do not.1 IntroductionSecurity issues arise whenever one person invokes a program writtenby another person. Aprogram usually executes with all the privileges of the user whoinvoked it, so...

Title: Purposive Behavior Acquisition for a Real Robot by Vision-Based Reinforcement Learning
Abstract: In [1], we have presented the soccer robot which had learned to shoota ball into the goal using the Q-learning. In this paper, we discussseveral issues in applying the Qlearning method to a real robot withvision sensor. First, to speed up the learning rate, we implement amechanism of Learning form Easy Missions (or LEM) which is a similartechnique to \shaping" in animal learning. LEM reduces thelearning rate from the exponential order in the size of the statespace to about the linear order of the size of the state space. Also,we save the learning time by policy transfer in which thegoal-directed behavior is rst acquired by Q-learning in computersimulation, and then the learned policy is copied into a real robotbrain. Next, a \state-action deviation" problem is found as aform of perceptual aliasing when we try to construct such a state(action) space that reects the outputs from physical sensors(actuators) . To cope with this, we construct an action set in such away tha...

Title: Planned Team Activity
Abstract: Agents situated in dynamic environments benefit from having arepertoire of plans,supplied in advance, that permit them to rapidly generate appropriatesequences of actions inresponse to important events. When agents can form teams, newproblems emerge regardingthe representation and execution of joint actions. In this paper weintroduce a languagefor representing joint plans for teams of agents, we describe howagents can organize theformation of a suitably skilled team to achieve a joint goal, and weexplain how such a teamcan execute these plans to generate complex, synchronized teamactivity.

Title: Purposive Behavior Acquisition for a Real Robot by Vision-Based Reinforcement Learning
Abstract: . This paper presents a method of vision-based reinforcement learningby which a robot learns to shoot a ball into a goal. We discussseveral issues in applying the reinforcement learning method to areal robot with vision sensor by which the robot can obtaininformation about the changes in an environment. First, we constructa state space in terms of size, position, and orientation of a balland a goal in an image, and an action space is designed in terms ofthe action commands to be sent to the left and right motors of amobile robot. This causes a \state-action deviation" problem inconstructing the state and action spaces that reect the outputs fromphysical sensors and actuators, respectively. To deal with thisissue, an action set is constructed in a way that one action consistsof a series of the same action primitive which is successivelyexecuted until the current state changes.

Title: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with the MAXQ Value Function Decomposition
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to hierarchical reinforcementlearning based on decomposingthe target Markov decision process (MDP) into a hierarchy of smallerMDPs and decomposingthe value function of the target MDP into an additive combination ofthe value functions of thesmaller MDPs. The decomposition, known as the MAXQ decomposition, hasboth a proceduralsemantics---as a subroutine hierarchy---and a declarativesemantics---as a representation of thevalue function of a hierarchical policy. MAXQ unifies and extendsprevious work on hierarchicalreinforcement learning by Singh, Kaelbling, and Dayan and Hinton. Itis based on theassumption that the programmer can identify useful subgoals anddefine subtasks that achievethese subgoals. By defining such subgoals, the programmer constrainsthe set of policies thatneed to be considered during reinforcement learning. The MAXQ valuefunction decompositioncan represent the value function of any policy that is consistentwith the ...

Abstract: This paper describes a novel approach to high-level robot programmingbased on a highly developed logical theory of action. The userprovides a specification of the robot's basic actions (theirpreconditions and effects on the environment) as well as of relevantaspects of the environment, in an extended version of the situationcalculus. He can then specify robot behaviors in terms of theseactions in a programming language that allows references to worldconditions (e.g. if 9c(Pop can(c) On table(c)) then pick up(c)). Theprograms can be executed to drive the robot. The interpreterautomatically maintains the world model required to execute programsbased on the specification. The theoretical framework includes asolution to the frame problem and is very general --- it handlesdynamic and incompletely known worlds, as well as perception actions.Given this kind of domain specification, it is also possible tosupport more sophisticated reasoning, such as task planning atrun-time. ...

Title: Advantages of a Leveled Commitment Contracting Protocol
Abstract: In automated negotiation systems consisting of self-interestedagents, contracts have traditionally been binding. Such contracts donot allow agents to efficiently accommodate future events. Gametheory has proposed contingency contracts to solve this problem.Among computational agents, contingency contracts are oftenimpractical due to large numbers of interdependent and unanticipatedfuture events to be conditioned on, and because some events are notmutually observable. This paper proposes a leveled commitmentcontracting protocol that allows self-interested agents toefficiently accommodate future events by having the possibility ofunilaterally decommitting from a contract based on local reasoning. Adecommitment penalty is assigned to both agents in a contract: to befreed from the obligations of the contract, an agent only pays thispenalty to the other party. It is shown through formal analysis ofmultiple contracting settings that this leveled commitment feature ina contract...

Abstract: Scheduling is the problem of allocating resources to alternativepossible uses over designated periods of time. Several have proposed(and some have tried) market-based approaches to decentralizedversions of the problem, where the competing uses are represented byautonomous agents. Market mechanisms use prices derived throughdistributed bidding protocols to determine an allocation, and thussolve the scheduling problem. To analyze the behavior of marketschemes, we formalize decentralized scheduling as a discrete resourceallocation problem, and bring to bear some relevant economicconcepts. Drawing on results from the literature, we discuss theexistence of equilibrium prices for some general classes ofscheduling problems, and the quality of equilibrium solutions.

Title: A Sanctuary for Mobile Agents
Abstract: ly, this is a circuit of the (complete) graph connecting the airlineservers, and the originator may chose this circuit at the time ofagent dispatch. At any honest server, the agent code and itsread-only state is checked when the agent arrives, so if themalicious server tries to tamper with the agent code or the read-onlystate the malicious server can not successfully pass the modifiedagent to an honest server. (Alternatively, the agent code and theread-only state may be considered to be reloaded from the originatorby every server.) Furthermore, we assume that the variable agentstate is transmitted among servers using authenticated and encryptedchannels, so that only the server that is the intended migrationtarget can receive the agent, as long as the agent is starting froman honest server. Thus, the malicous server can not intercept anagent as it migrates from an honest server to another server. At anyserver, an agent may query the server's identity. At first glance,this...

Artificial evolution can operate upon reconfigurable electroniccircuits to produceefficient and powerful control systems for autonomous mobile robots.Evolving physicalhardware instead of control systems simulated in software results inmore than just a rawspeed increase: it is possible to exploit the physical properties ofthe implementation (such asthe semiconductor physics of integrated circuits) to obtain controlcircuits of unprecedentedpower. The space of these evolvable circuits is far larger than thespace of solutions in whicha human designer works, because to make design tractable, a moreabstract view than thatof detailed physics must be adopted. To allow circuits to be designedat this abstract level,constraints are applied to the design that limit how the naturaldynamical behaviour of thecomponents is reflected in the overall behaviour of the system.

Abstract: A method is proposed which accomplishes a whole task consisting ofplural subtasks by coordinating multiple behaviors acquired by avision-based reinforcement learning. First, individual behaviorswhich achieve the corresponding subtasks are independently acquiredby Q-learning, a widely used reinforcement learning method. Eachlearned behavior can be represented by an action-value function interms of state of the environment and robot action. Next, three kindsof coordinations of multiple behaviors are considered; simplesummation of dierent action-value functions, switching action-valuefunctions according to situations, and learning with previouslyobtained actionvalue functions as initial values of a newaction-value function.

Abstract: This paper describes methods and data structures used to leveragemotion sequences of complex linked figures. We present a techniquefor interpolating between example motions derived from live motioncapture or produced through traditional animation tools. Thesemotions can be characterized by emotional expressiveness or controlbehaviors such as turning or going uphill or downhill. We call suchparameterized motions "verbs" and the parameters thatcontrol them "adverbs." Verbs can be combined with otherverbs to form a "verb graph," with smooth transitionsbetween them, allowing an animated figure to exhibit a substantialrepertoire of expressive behaviors. A combination of radial basisfunctions and low order polynomials is used to create theinterpolation space between example motions. Inverse kinematicconstraints are used to augment the interpolations in order to avoid,for example, the feet slipping on the floor during a support phase ofa walk cycle. Once the verbs and...

Our approach is to automatically generate userinterface elements directly from the data model. This savestime and effort and at the same time style rules can be appliedautomatically to the design of the user interface.

Title: State of the Art Review on Hypermedia Issues And Applications
Abstract: Machine (HAM) [Consens & Mendelzon, 1989]. It addresses thefollowingissues raised by Halasz: Search and query mechanisms, augmentation ofthe basic node and link model,virtual structures, computation over the hypertext network, andversioning. Using GraphLog, queries areformulated by drawing graph patterns. These patterns are thensearched for in the hypertext network toyield subgraphs.GraphLog is highly expressive and it uses the notions of deductivedatabase theory and descriptivecomplexity. The language is powerful enough to allow thespecification and manipulation of arbitrarysubsets of the network and supports the computation of aggregatefunctions on the subgraphs of thehypertext document. It can support dynamically defined structures aswell as inference capabilities.GraphLog is an extension of the graph-based query language called G+.G+ was extended by adding thenotions of negation, aggregation, and improved semantics to make itsimple, yet powerful.

Title: A Component based Services Architecture for Building Distributed Applications
Abstract: This paper describes an approach tobuilding a distributed software component system forscientific and engineering applications that is based onrepresenting GRID services as application-level softwarecomponents. These GRID services provide toolssuch as registry and directory services, event services,and remote component creation. While a servicesbasedarchitecture for Grids and other distributedsystems is not new, this framework provides severalunique features. First, the public interfaces toeach software component are described as XML documents.This allows many adaptors and user interfacesto be generated from the specification dynamically.Second, this system is designed to exploit the resourcesof existing Grid infrastructures like Globus[7],[15], Legion[17], [7], and commercial Internet frameworkslike e-speak[11]. Third, and most important,the component-based design extends throughoutthe system. Hence tools such as application builderswhich allow users to select compo...

Title: Towards a General Computational Framework for Model-Based Interface Development Systems
Abstract: Model-based interface development systems have not beenable to progress beyond producing narrowly focusedinterface designs of restricted applicability. We identify alevel-of-abstraction mismatch in interface models, whichwe call the mapping problem, as the cause of thelimitations in the usefulness of model-based systems. Wepropose a general computational framework for solving themapping problem in model-based systems. We show animplementation of the framework within the MOBI-D(Model-Based Interface Designer) interface developmentenvironment. The MOBI-D approach to solving themapping problem enables for the first time with modelbasedtechnology the design of a wide variety of types ofuser interfaces.

Title: A Structure for Transportable, Dynamic Multimedia Documents
Abstract: This paper presents a document structure for describingtransportable, dynamic multimedia documents. Multimedia documentsconsist of a set of discrete data components that are joined togetherin time and space to present a user (or reader) with a singlecoordinated whole. Transportable documents are those in which thedocument structure can be accessed across system environmentsindependently of individual component input or output dependencies;dynamic documents are those in which the synchronization of documentcomponents are not staticly defined as an integral part of the datadefinition but are dynamicly defined as attributes of the generaldocument structure. The focus of this paper is the presentation ofthe basic building blocks of the CWI Multimedia Interchange Format(CMIF). CMIF is used to describe the temporal and structuralrelationships that exist in multimedia documents. In order to put ourwork in a concrete context, we start our discussion with a briefdescription of th...

Abstract: . Cranium is a processor-network interface for an interconnectionnetwork based on adaptive packet routing. Adaptive networksrelax the restriction that packet order is preserved; packets may bedeliveredto their destinations in an arbitrary sequence. Cranium uses twomechanisms: an automatic-receive interface for packet serializationandhigh performance, and a processor-initiated interface forflexibility. Tominimize software overhead, Cranium is directly accessible byuser-levelprograms. Protection for user-level message passing is implemented bymapping user-level handles into physical node identifiers and bufferaddresses.1 IntroductionScalable multicomputer architectures have been converging on astandard organizationwith four elements: a workstation microprocessor, main memory basedon dynamic RAM, a point-to-point interconnection network and aprocessornetworkinterface.

Title: A Framework for Comparing Text Categorization Approaches
Abstract: For the past few years, text categorization hasemerged as an application domain to machine learningtechniques. Several approaches have already beenproposed. This paper does not present yet anothertechnique. It is rather an attempt to unify the approachesencountered so far. Moreover this state-ofthe-art enables us to stress a shortcoming in earlierresearch: the lack of evaluation of inductive learnersin the categorization process. We present a first attemptto remedy this lack. We expose an experimentalframework, that fits in with our unified view of textcategorization methods. This framework allows us toconduct a set of tentative experiments in order to assesswhich characteristics allow a learner to performwell on the text categorization task.IntroductionText categorization, which is often defined as thecontent-based assignment of one or more predefinedcategories to texts, has become important in two aspects.On an information retrieval (IR) point of view,information...

This model ofgeneralization, as well as the four refinement operators have beenimplemented in a system for theory revision that proved effective inthe area of electronic document classification. 1.

Title: Vector-based Natural Language Call Routing
Abstract: This paper describes a domain independent, automatically trainednatural language callrouter for directing incoming calls in a call center. Our call routerdirects customer calls basedon their response to an open-ended "How may I direct yourcall?" prompt. Routing behavioris trained from a corpus of transcribed and hand-routed calls andthen carried out using vectorbasedinformation retrieval techniques. Terms consist of n-gram sequencesof morphologicallyreduced content words, while documents representing routingdestinations consists of weightedterm frequencies derived from calls to that destination in thetraining corpus. Based on the statisticaldiscriminating power of the n-gram terms extracted from the caller'srequest, the calleris 1) routed to the appropriate destination, 2) transferred to ahuman operator, or 3) asked a disambiguationquestion. In the last case, the system dynamically generates queriestailored to thecaller's request and the destinations with which it is consistent,based on our extension of thevector model. Evaluation of the call router performance over afinancial services call center usingboth accurate transcriptions of calls and fairly noisy speechrecognizer output demonstratedrobustness in the face of speech recognition errors. Furthermore, oursystem showed a substantialimprovement in performance over existing systems by correctly routing93.8% of the callsafter punting 10.2% of all calls to a human operator ontranscription, with approximately 4%degradation in performance when using speech recognizer output with a23% word error rate.

We also explore the use of differentkinds of codes, namely Error-Correcting Codes,Random Codes, and Domain and Data-specificcodes and give experimental results for each ofthem. The ECOC method scales well to largedata sets with a large number of classes.Experiments on a real-world data set show areduction in classification error by up to 66%over the traditional Naive Bayes Classifier.

Abstract: We describe a simple active learning heuristicwhich greatly enhances the generalization behaviorof support vector machines (SVMs) on severalpractical document classification tasks. Weobserve a number of benefits, the most surprisingof which is that a SVM trained on a wellchosensubset of the available corpus frequentlyperforms better than one trained on all availabledata. The heuristic for choosing this subset issimple to compute, and makes no use of informationabout the test set. Given that the trainingtime of SVMs depends heavily on the trainingset size, our heuristic not only offers better performancewith fewer data, it frequently does soin less time than the naive approach of trainingon all available data.1.

However, like most machine learning algorithms, theyare generally appliedusing a randomly selected training set classified in advance. In manysettings, we also havethe option of using pool-based active learning. Instead of using arandomly selected trainingset, the learner has access to a pool of unlabeled instances and canrequest the labels for somenumber of them. We introduce a new algorithm for performing activelearning with supportvector machines, i.e., an algorithm for choosing which instances torequest next. We providea theoretical motivation for the algorithm using the notion of aversion space. We presentexperimental results showing that employing our active learningmethod can significantlyreduce the need for labeled training instances in both the standardinductive and transductivesettings.Keywords: Active Learning, Selective Sampling, Support VectorMachines, Classification,Relevance FeedbackAbbreviations: SVM -- Support Vector Machine; TSVM -- TransductiveSupport Vector Machine1.

Abstract: Document image compression reduces the storage requirements fordigitised books or documents by using characters as the fundamentalunit of compression. Compression gains can be achieved by identifyingregions that contain text, isolating unique characters, and storingthem in a codebook. This thesis investigates several fundamentalareas of the compression process. Algorithms for each area are testedon a corpus of images and the improvements tested for statisticalsignificance.

Weintroduce the use of the docstrum to aid image compression and showthat it improves upon previous methods. The Hough transform is shownto be an accurate method for determining page skew and gives robustresults over a range of image resolutions.

Title: Hierarchical taxonomies using divisive partitioning
Abstract: We propose an unsupervised divisive partitioning algorithm fordocument data sets which enjoys many favorable properties. Inparticular, the algorithm shows excellent scalability to large datacollections and produces high quality clusters which are competitivewith other clustering methods. The algorithm yields information onthe significant and distinctive words within each cluster, and thesewords can be inserted into the naturally occuring hierarchicalstructure produced by the algorithm. The result is an automaticallygenerated hierarchical topical taxonomy of a document set. In thispaper, we show how the algorithm's cost scales up linearly with thesize of the data, illustrate experimentally the quality of theclusters produced, and show how the algorithm can produce ahierarchical topical taxonomy.

Title: Data-Oriented Language Processing: An Overview
Abstract: Data-oriented models of language processing embody the assumptionthat human languageperception and production works with representations of concrete pastlanguage experiences,rather than with abstract grammar rules. Such models thereforemaintain large corpora oflinguistic representations of previously occurring utterances. Whenprocessing a new inpututterance, analyses of this utterance are constructed by combiningfragments from the corpus;the occurrence-frequencies of the fragments are used to estimatewhich analysis is the mostprobable one. This paper motivates the idea of data-oriented languageprocessing by consideringthe problem of syntactic disambiguation. One relatively simpleparsing/disambiguation modelthat implements this idea is described in some detail. This modelassumes a corpus of utterancesannotated with labelled phrase-structure trees, and parses new inputby combining subtrees fromthe corpus; it selects the most probable parse of an input utteranceby con...

Abstract: We give a probabilistic semantics to formulas of the modalmu-calculus, where modelsare probabilistic transition systems and meanings are functions fromstates to the unitinterval. The meaning of a formula OE in a state q is thus theprobability that OE holds inq. We relate the new semantics to the standard Boolean one overlabeled transitionsystems. Combining hai or ¯x with [a] or x generally createsdifferences to theclassical interpretation which allow one to verify liveness andfairness properties ofprobabilistic transition systems. The \Sigma-algebra of our semanticsis bicontinuous. Wepoint out how our approach differs from the syntax and semantics ofPML due toLarsen & Skou. We give a co-inductive definition of probabilisticbisimulation andshow that its greatest fixed point is a probabilistic bisimulation;in fact, it is the unionof all those in the sense of Larsen & Skou.

Abstract: We propose that the phenomenon of local state may be understood interms of Strachey's concept of parametric (i.e., uniform) polymorphism. The intuitivebasis for ourproposal is the following analogy: a non-local procedure isindependent of locally-declaredvariables in the same way that a parametrically polymorphic functionis independent oftypes to which it is instantiated.A connection between parametricity and representational abstractionwas first suggestedby J. C. Reynolds. Reynolds used logical relations to formalize thisconnection inlanguages with type variables and user-defined types. We userelational parametricityto construct a model for an Algol-like language in which interactionsbetween local andnon-local entities satisfy certain relational criteria. Reasoningabout local variables essentiallyinvolves proving properties of polymorphic functions.

We first show that the context-freelanguages for whichthe number of words of every length is bounded by a fixed polynomialare exactlythe bounded context-free languages in the sense of Ginsburg [G].Thus, wepresent a length characterization for bounded context-free languages.We thenstudy slender context-free languages, i.e., those containing at mosta constantnumber of words of each length. Recently, Ilie proved that every suchlanguagecan be described by a finite union of terms of the form uviwxiy [I]. We provide acompletely different proof of this, using constructive methods. Thisenables us toprove that thinness and slenderness are decidable.

Abstract: Some quantities associated with periodicities in words are analyzedwithin the Bernoulliprobabilistic model. In particular, the following problem isaddressed. Assume that a stringX is given, with symbols emitted randomly but independently accordingto some known distributionof probabilities. Then, for each pair (W , Z) of distinct suffixes ofX, the expectedlength of the longest common prefix of W and Z is sought. Thecollection of these lengths,that are called here self-alignments, plays a crucial role in severalalgorithmic problems onwords, such as building suffix trees or inverted files, detectingsquares and other regularities,computing substring statistics, etc. The asymptotically bestalgorithms for these problemsare quite complex and thus risk to be unpractical. The presentanalysis of self-alignmentsand related measures suggests that, in a variety of cases, morestraightforward algorithmicsolutions may yield comparable or even better performances.Key words and ph...

Thecommunication mechanism is inherited from the blackboard model ofproblem solving.Intuitively, the granularity of the logic processes to be elaboratedin parallel is large,while the resources shared on the blackboard can be veryfine-grained.An operational semantics for Shared Prolog is given in terms of adistributed model.Through an abstract notion of computation, the kinds of parallelismsupported by thelanguage as well as properties of infinite computations, such aslocal deadlocks, arestudied.The expressiveness of the language is shown with respect to thespecification of twoclasses of applications: metaprogramming and blackboard systems.Categories an...

Title: Building Ontologies: Towards a Unified Methodology
Abstract: The use and importance of ontologies is becoming more widespread,however building ontologies is largely a black art. The aim of thispaper is to identify and characterise what we currently know and tomove towards the longer term goal of developing a comprehensiveunified methodology. We first identify dimensions for characterisingontologies, to be used as a basis for noting which techniques andguidelines for building ontologies apply in different circumstances.We then give an overview of the current state of the art, noting thatmost work addresses just a small part of the life cycle. The very fewmore complete methods are limited to case studies involving singleontologies and they are hard to compare. In the main part of thispaper, we examine two such methods and give a framework for comparingand unifying them. We emphasise that different approaches arerequired for difference circumstances, and give some guidelines forwhen to use which techniques. We conclude by ...

We analyze severalcomputational problems underlyingthe class design process which is divided into two phases: a learningphase and anoptimization phase.

Title: Syntactic Codes and Grammar Refinement
Abstract: . We call syntactic coding a technique which converts syntacticprinciples or constraintson representations into grammatical rules which can be implemented inany given rule grammar.In this paper we show that any principle or constraint on outputtrees formalizable in a certainfragment of dynamic logic over trees can be coded in this sense. Thisallows to reduce in a mechanicalfashion most of the current theories of government and binding intogpsg-style grammars.This will be exemplified with Rizzi's Relativized Minimality.Key words: government and binding, relativized minimality, gpsg,dynamic logic1. IntroductionThis paper is an introduction into the method of syntactic coding.Syntactic codingis quite simply a method to convert descriptions of syntactic treesor syntactic principlesinto a rule based grammar -- preferrably context-free -- which doesnothingelse but produce exactly those trees which conform to thatdescription. The gainof this method is considerable. Firs...

Abstract: In this paper, we further elaborate global control for partialdeduction:For which atoms, among possibly infinitely many, shouldpartial deductions be produced, meanwhile guaranteeing correctnessas well as termination, and providing ample opportunities forfinegrainedpolyvariance?Our solution is based on two ingredients. First, we use the wellknownconcept of a characteristic tree to guide abstraction (orgeneralisation)and polyvariance, and aim for producing one specialisedprocedure per characteristic tree generated. Previous work alongthis line failed to provide abstraction correctly dealing withcharacteristictrees. We show how this can be rectified in an elegant way.Secondly, we structure combinations of atoms and associatedcharacteristictrees in global trees registering "causal" relationshipsamongsuch pairs. This will allow us to spot looming non-termination andconsequently perform proper generalisation in order to avert thedanger,without having to i...

Forexample the logic is adequate toexpress branching quantifiers. We describe a compositional semanticsfor this logic; in particularthis gives a compositional meaning to formulas of the`information-friendly' language of Hintikkaand Sandu. For first-order formulas the semantics reduces to Tarski'ssemantics for first-order logic.We prove that two formulas have the same interpretation in allstructures if and only if replacingan occurrence of one by an occurrence of the other in a sentencenever alters the truth-value of thesentence in any structure.1Keywords : game semantics, compositional, imperfect information,independence-friendly, branchingquantifier, generalised quantifier, trumpFor over a third of a century we have had adaptations of first-orderlogic which allowcontrol of the amount of information passing fr...

Title: Emergence of net-grammar in communicating agents
Abstract: Evolution of symbolic language and grammar is studied in a networkmodel. Language is expressedby words, i.e. strings of symbols, which are generated by agents withtheir own symbolicgrammar system. Agents communicate with each other by deriving andaccepting words in termsof their own grammar. They are ranked according to theircommunicative effectiveness: an agentwhich can derive less frequent and less acceptable words and acceptwords in less computationaltime will have higher scores. They can evolve by mutationalprocesses, which change rewriting rulesin their symbolic grammars. Complexity and diversity of wordsincrease in the course of time. Theemergence of modules and loop structure enhances the evolution. Onthe other hand, ensemblestructure lead to a net-grammar, restricting individual grammars andtheir evolution.Key words: Net-grammar; Algorithmic evolution; Module-type evolution;Evolution of language;Symbolic grammar systems1 IntroductionLinguistic expressions...

Title: Case-based representation and learning of pattern languages
Abstract: Pattern languages seem to suit case-based reasoning particularlywell.Therefore, the problem of inductively learning pattern languages isparaphrasedin a case-based manner. A careful investigation requires a formalsemantics forcase bases together with similarity measures in terms of formallanguages. Twobasic semantics are introduced and investigated. It turns out thatrepresentabilityproblems are major obstacles for case-based learnability. Restrictingtheattention to so-called proper patterns avoids these representabilityproblems.A couple of learnability results for proper pattern languages arederived bothfor case-based learning from only positive data and for case-basedlearning frompositive and negative data. Under the so-called competing semantics,we showthat the learnability result for positive and negative data can belifted to thegeneral case of arbitrary patterns. Learning under the standardsemantics frompositive data is closely related to monotonic language l...

Abstract: Fuzzy rules have been advocated as a key tool for expressing piecesof knowledge in "fuzzy logic". However, there does notexist a unique kind of fuzzy rules, nor is there only one type of"fuzzy logic". This diversity has caused many amisunderstanding in the literature of fuzzy control. The paper is asurvey of different possible semantics for a fuzzy rule and shows howthey can be captured in the framework of fuzzy set and possibilitytheory. It is pointed out that the interpretation of fuzzy rulesdictates the way the fuzzy rules should be combined. The variouskinds of fuzzy rules considered in the paper (gradual rules,certainty rules, possibility rules, and others) have differentinference behaviors and correspond to various intended uses andapplications. The representation of fuzzy unless-rules is brieflyinvestigated on the basis of their intended meaning.

Title: A Comparison of Q-Learning and Classifier Systems
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning is a class of problems inwhich an autonomous agent acting in a givenenvironment improves its behavior by progressivelymaximizing a function calculated just on the basis ofa succession of scalar responses received from theenvironment. Q-learning and classifier systems (CS)are two methods among the most used to solve reinforcementlearning problems. Notwithstanding theirpopularity and their shared goal, they have been inthe past often considered as two different models. Inthis paper we first show that the classifier system,when restricted to a sharp simplification calleddiscounted max very simple classifier system (D MAX -VSCS), boils down to tabular Q-learning. It followsthat D MAX -VSCS converges to the optimal policy asproved by Watkins & Dayan (1992), and that it candraw profit from the results of experimental andtheoretical works dedicated to improve Q-learning andto facilitate its use in concrete applications.

An evolutionary algorithm canevolve fuzzy systems, while fuzzy logic can beused to control evolution to speed up convergenceto a global optimum and escape fromlocal optima. Besides, concepts that are inherentin the workings of evolutionary algorithms,like fitness, can be fuzzified, thus taking advantageof a tolerance for imprecision in orderto save computational resources.These ideas are demonstrated in an evolutionaryalgorithm for fuzzy controller synthesisand optimization.1 IntroductionIntegration of evolutionary algorithm andfuzzy logic can happen in three complementaryforms.The most obvious one exploits the optimumsearching ability of evolutionary algorithmsto synthesize and optimize a fuzzy system,The author was sponsored in part by SGSThomsonMicroelectronicssuch as a fuzzy rule set or a neuro-fuzzy network.This com...

Title: A Description Logic for Vague Knowledge
Abstract: This work introduces the concept language ALCFM which is an extensionof ALC to many-valued logics. ALCFM allows to express vague concepts,e.g. more or less enlarged or very small. To realize this extensionto many-valued logics, the classical notions of satisfiability andsubsumptionhad to be modified appropriately. For example, ALCFM -conceptsare no longer either satisfiable or unsatisfiable, but they aresatisfiableto a certain degree. The main contribution of this paper is a soundandcomplete method for computing the degree of subsumption between twoALCFM -concepts.1 IntroductionThis work takes its motivation from the occurrence of vague conceptdescriptionsin different application areas.

Abstract: In this paper we present a method to analyze stability for nonlinearsystems consisting of weighted linear subsystems.A large class of nonlinear systems can be represented in this way,e.g. weighted local linearized subsystems or fuzzysystems. There are sufficient stability conditions presented in thefuzzy literature which says that these kind of systemsare stable if it is possible to find a common positive definitematrix P ? 0. However, such a matrix does not alwaysexist. We present a stronger stability result herein. Stability isshown by joining multiple quadratic Lyapunov functionsproperly in the state space. The stability conditions are formulatedas a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. This isattractive since we then have an efficient computerized method tofind the Lyapunov functions.Keywords: Nonlinear dynamics, Fuzzy modeling, Stability.1 IntroductionStability theory plays a central role in system theory andengineering.

This Chapter considers the second case. That is, the fuzzycontroller directly generates the steering commandfrom the sensor inputs [2].The approach b) is related with fuzzy reactive approaches for mobilerobot navigation. In this case the controllerinputs are provided by the external sensors.The chapter is organized as follows. The following section is devotedto fuzzy direct explicit path tracking. The sectionincludes the description of the method and the application to themobile robot RAM-1. The next section is relatedto reactive navigation.

Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid learning methodin which fuzzy logic controllers (FLC) are automaticallydesigned by means of a geneticalgorithm (GA). A messy coding scheme isproposed which allows a compact and flexiblerepresentation of the fuzzy rules in agenetic string. The complexity and size ofthe rule base are reduced which enables theGA to solve the design task even for FLCswith a large number of input variables. Adynamically weighted objective function issuggested for control problems with multipletasks, which prevents the GA from prematureconvergence on FLCs that are specializedexclusively to the easier subtasks.

Abstract: In this paper we present an approach to designing a novel type offuzzy controller. B-spline basis functions are used for inputvariables and fuzzy singletons for output variables to specifylinguistic terms. "Product" is chosen as the fuzzyconjunction, and "centroid" as the defuzzification method.By appropriately designing the rule base, a fuzzy controller can beinterpreted as a B-spline interpolator. Such a fuzzy controller maylearn to approximate any known data sequences and to minimise acertain cost function. By choosing such a function appropriately, thelearning process can be made to converge rapidly. We applied thisapproach to the problems of function approximation and bothsupervised and unsupervised learning of mobile robots. Experimentsvalidate the advantages of this approach. 1 Introduction Recently,fuzzy logic control (FLC) has been successfully applied to a widerange of control problems and has demonstrated some advantages, e.g.,in efficiency of developing cont...

Typically, DLs are limited todealing with crisp, well defined concepts. That is, conceptsfor which the problem whether an individual isan instance of it is a yes/no question. More often thannot, the concepts encountered in the real world do nothave a precisely defined criteria of membership: wemay say that an individual is an instance of a conceptonly to a certain degree, depending on the individual'sproperties. Concepts of this kind are rather vague thanprecise. As fuzzy logic directly deals with the notion ofvagueness and imprecision, it o#ers an appealing foundationfor a generalisation of DLs to vague concepts.In this paper we present a general fuzzy DL, whichcombines fuzzy logic with DLs.

The majority, taken overweighted combined votes, determines the final decision.The suggested algorithm is based on parallel independentcomputations which have low complexity.

Abstract: To deal with the frequent, foreseeable and variabledisconnections that occur in a mobile environment, weintroduce a flexible, two-level consistency model. Semanticallyrelated or closely located data are groupedtogether to form a cluster. While all data inside acluster are mutually consistent, degrees of inconsistencyare allowed among data at different clusters. Totake advantage of the predictability of disconnections,and to accommodate mobility, the cluster configurationis dynamic. We allow transactions to exhibit certaindegrees of tolerance for inconsistencies by introducingstrict and weak operations. Weak operationsare operations that can be executed under weaker consistencyrequirements. We define correctness criteriafor schedules that involve weak operations and comparethem with traditional serializability criteria. Finally,we argue that our model is appropriate for a varietyof other environments including very large databasesand multidatabases.1 IntroductionIn...

Next, we introduce "multicast groups"of mobile hosts wherein each multicast group is associated with a"host view", a set of MSSs representing the aggregatelocation information of the group. A host-view membership algorithmis then presented and combined with the multicastscheme for exactly-once delivery. As a result, to deliver a multicastmessage to a specified group, copies of the message needbe propagated only to the MSSs in the group's host-view.1 Introduction

We demonstrate the utility oflinking physical objects to electronic services and actionsthat are naturally associated with their form (e.g., adictionary and a web-based translation service). Unlikeprevious work in this area, we have focused on uniquelycombining four inexpensive technologies with off-the-shelfapplications, everyday objects, and computational devices.KEYWORDS: RFID tag, ubiquitous computing, tangibleinterface, physical UI, phicon, augmented reality.INTRODUCTIONSix years ag...

Abstract: Host mobility is becoming an increasingly important feature with therecent arrival ofnotebook and palm top computers, the development of wireless networkinterfaces andthe implementation of the global network. This paper describes andcompares threeproposals from Sony, IBM and Columbia University for mobile hostprotocols (MHP)that are compatible with the TCP/IP protocol suite. A set of basicrequirements for aMHP are also suggested and it is observed that none of the threeproposals entirelysatisfies these requirements.

Title: A Routing Protocol for Packet Radio Networks
Abstract: We present a new distance-vector routing protocol fora packet radio network. The new distributed routingprotocol, WRP, works on the notion of second-to-lasthop node to a destination. WRP reduces the numberof cases in which a temporary routing loop can occurand also provides a mechanism for the reliable transmissionof update messages. The performance of WRPhas been compared quantitatively by simulations withthat of distributed Bellman-Ford (DBF), DUAL (a loopfreedistance-vector algorithm) and an ideal link-statealgorithm (ILS) which represents the state of the artof Internet routing, in a highly dynamic environment.The simulation results indicate that WRP is the mostefficient of the algorithms simulated in a wireless environment.1 IntroductionWith the recent proliferation of laptop and portable computers, andthe development of wireless network interfaces, host mobility isbecoming an important issue.

Title: Enhanced Services for World-Wide Web in Mobile WAN Environment
Abstract: Currently, the World-Wide Web (WWW) is the best-known and most widelyused distributed multimedia application. By utilising the dataservices of a cellular telephone system, for example the digital GSMsystem, WWW can be brought to nomadic users. The advantage of usingan existing cellular network like the GSM is that it takes care ofterminal mobility, including location updates and handovers. Thecharacteristics of cellular telephone links are, however, quitedifferent from those of wireline links. The basic characteristics ofany cellular telephone link are narrow bandwidth, highly variabletransmission delays, and sudden disconnections. Therefore, such alink creates problems for WWW and other multimedia applicationsdesigned to operate with fast and reliable connections. WWW uses theHyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which in turn is based on TCP.These protocols exhibit a number of performance problems in awide-area mobile networks.

Title: On Optimal Call Admission Control in Cellular Networks
Abstract: Two important Quality-of-Service (QoS) measuresfor current cellular networks are the fractions of newand handoff "calls" that are blocked due to unavailabilityof "channels" (radio and/or computing resources).Based on these QoS measures, we derive optimal admissioncontrol policies for three problems: minimizinga linear objective function of the new and handoffcall blocking probabilities (MINOBJ), minimizingthe new call blocking probability with a hard constrainton the handoff call blocking probability (MINBLOCK)and minimizing the number of channels with hard constraintson both of the blocking probabilities (MINC).We show that the well-known Guard Channel policyis optimal for the MINOBJ problem, while a newFractional Guard Channel policy is optimal for theMINBLOCK and MINC problems. The Guard Channelpolicy reserves a set of channels for handoff callswhile the Fractional Guard Channel policy effectivelyreserves a non-integral number of guard channels forhandoff calls by...

Title: Measured performance of a wireless LAN
Abstract: We have studied the performance of a high-speed commercialspread-spectrum wireless LAN that uses the CSMA/CA multiple-accessstrategy. Employing synthetic workloads, we measured packet capturesuccess more so than signal propagation characteristics.Specifically, we measured throughput, packet loss rates, range, andpatterns of errors within packets. We conclude that CSMA/CA is quitesuccessful in allocating bandwidth under stress, but that packetcapture rate degrades very quickly once the LAN's effective range isexceeded. Hence, network maintainers should plan the layout ofwireless networks at least as carefully as they plan wired networks.1 Introduction Thanks to regulatory decisions and improvements intechnology, the last several years have seen an explosion ofdevelopments in the commercial wireless sector of thetelecommunications industry.

Title: An Architecture and Communication Protocol for Picocellular Networks
Abstract: In this paper we present an architecture for a picocellular networkand a novel communicationprotocol for mobile users in such networks. The cell size in thesenetworks is verysmall -- typically of the order of a room in a building, resulting inan environment where themovement between cells is very rapid. This makes the problems oftracking and maintainingcommunication between mobile users non-trivial.To better track these mobile users we propose an architectureconsisting of a two levelhierarchy of fixed nodes. This architecture combined with the idea ofgroups ensures thatseamless communication is maintained between mobile users. Groups arespecial collectionsof picocells and represent regions where a mobile user is likely tobe located in the nearfuture. Thus, messages addressed to this mobile user are multicast toall the picocellsin the group guaranteeing delivery and obviating the need formessages to be forwardedbetween picocells.

Title: Supporting Semantics-Based Transaction Processing in Mobile Database Applications
Abstract: Advances in computer and telecommunication technologieshave made mobile computing a reality. However,greater mobility implies a more tenuous networkconnection and a higher rate of disconnection. In orderto tolerate disconnections as well as to reduce thedelays and cost of wireless communication, it is necessaryto support autonomous mobile operations on datashared by stationary hosts. This would allow the partof a computation executing on a mobile host to continueexecuting while the mobile host is not connectedto the network.In this paper, we examine whether object semanticscan be exploited to facilitate autonomous and disconnectedoperation in mobile database applications. Wedefine the class of fragmentable objects which may besplit among a number of sites, operated upon independentlyat each site, and then recombined in a semanticallyconsistent fashion. A number of objects withsuch characteristics are presented and an implementationof fragmentable stacks is shown and ...

Abstract: This paper describes two techniques that improve throughputin an ad hoc network in the presence of nodes that agreeto forward packets but fail to do so. To mitigate this problem,we propose categorizing nodes based upon their dynamicallymeasured behavior. We use a watchdog that identiesmisbehaving nodes and a pathrater that helps routing protocolsavoid these nodes. Through simulation we evaluatewatchdog and pathrater using packet throughput, percentageof overhead (routing) transmissions, and the accuracy ofmisbehaving node detection. When used together in a networkwith moderate mobility, the two techniques increasethroughput by 17% in the presence of 40% misbehavingnodes, while increasing the percentage of overhead transmissionsfrom the standard routing protocol's 9% to 17%. Duringextreme mobility, watchdog and pathrater can increasenetwork throughput by 27%, while increasing the overheadtransmissions from the standard routing protocol's 12% to24%.1. INTRODUCTIONTh...

Title: Disseminating Active Map Information to Mobile Hosts
Abstract: Mobile computing differs from desk-top computing because of thedynamic nature ofsystem state: as users move, the sets of stationary and mobileobjects they control andthe types of information they wish to access change. Navigating amobile environmentcan be aided by active maps that describe the location andcharacteristics of objectswithin some region as they change over time. We describe an activemap service thatkeeps clients informed of changes in their environment. The primaryissue driving ourdesign is the question of scale: an active map service must be ableto handle updatesand queries over sufficiently large regions of space to satisfyclients' interests and mustbe able to handle peak loads that can occur when everyone in a regionis movingaround, for example, to attend a meeting. Our solution detects setsof clients that wishto receive the same active map information and then dynamicallyassigns multicastgroups to them. To guarantee clients that they and their com...

We focus on the related questionof finding a connecteddominating set of minimum size, where the graph induced by verticesin the dominating setis required to be connected as well. This problem arises in networktesting, as well as inwireless communication.Two polynomial time algorithms that achieve approximation factors of2H (\Delta) + 2 andH (\Delta) + 2 are presented, where \Delta is the maximum degree, andH is the harmonic function.This question also arises in relation to the traveling touristproblem, where one is looking forthe shortest tour such that each vertex is either visited, or has atleast one of its neighborsvisited. We also consider a generalization of the problem to theweighted case, and give analgorithm with an approximation factor of (c n ...

This paperexamines alternative data access microarchitectures that effectivelysupport compilerassisted data prefetching in superscalar processors.In particular, a prefetch buffer is shown to be more effective thanincreasing the cache dimension in solving the cache pollutionproblem. All in all, we show that a small data cache withcompiler-assisted data prefetching can achieve a performance levelclose to that of an ideal cache. 1 Introduction Superscalarprocessors can potentially deliver more than five times speedup overconventional single-issue processors [1]. With the total executioncycle count dramatically reduced, each cycle becomes more significantto the overall performance. Because each data cache miss canintroduce many extra execution cycles, a superscalar processor caneasily lose the majority of its performance to the memory hierarchy.Out-of-...

Title: Typed Memory Management in a Calculus of Capabilities
Abstract: An increasing number of systems rely on programming languagetechnology to ensure safety and security of low-levelcode. Unfortunately, these systems typically rely on a complex,trusted garbage collector. Region-based type systemsprovide an alternative to garbage collection by making memorymanagement explicit but verifiably safe. However, it hasnot been clear how to use regions in low-level, type-safe code.We present a compiler intermediate language, called theCapability Calculus, that supports region-based memorymanagement, enjoys a provably safe type system, and isstraightforward to compile to a typed assembly language.Source languages may be compiled to our language usingknown region inference algorithms. Furthermore, region lifetimesneed not be lexically scoped in our language, yet thelanguage may be checked for safety without complex analyses.Finally, our soundness proof is relatively simple, employingonly standard techniques.The central novelty is the use of static...

Title: Flow-directed Inlining
Abstract: A flow-directed inlining strategy uses information derived fromcontrol-flow analysis to specialize and inline procedures forfunctional and object-oriented languages. Since it uses control-flowanalysis to identify candidate call sites, flowdirected inlining caninline procedures whose relationships to their call sites are notapparent. For instance, procedures defined in other modules, passedas arguments, returned as values, or extracted from data structurescan all be inlined. Flow-directed inlining specializes procedures forparticular call sites, and can selectively inline a particularprocedure at some call sites but not at others. Finally,flow-directed inlining encourages modular implementations:control-flow analysis, inlining, and post-inlining optimizations areall orthogonal components. Results from a prototype implementationindicate that this strategy effectively reduces procedure calloverhead and leads to significant reduction in execution time. 1Introduction Functio...

Title: Storage Assignment to Decrease Code Size
Abstract: DSP architectures typically provide indirect addressing modes withauto-increment and decrement. In addition, indexing mode is notavailable, and there are usually few, if any, general-purposeregisters. Hence, it is necessary to use address registers andperform address arithmetic to access automatic variables. Subsumingthe address arithmetic into auto-increment and auto-decrement modesimproves the size of the generated code. In this paper we present aformulation of the problem of optimal storage assignment such thatexplicit instructions for address arithmetic are minimized. We provethat for the case of a single address register the decision problemis NP-complete. We then generalize the problem to multiple addressregisters. For both cases heuristic algorithms are given. Ourexperimental results indicate an improvement of 3% to 20% in codesize. 1 Introduction Microprocessors such as microcontrollers andfixed-point digital signal processors (DSPs) are increasingly beingembedde...

Title: Value Profiling
Abstract: Identifying variables as invariant or constant at compile-time allowsthe compiler to perform optimizations including constant folding,code specialization, and partial evaluation. Some variables, whichcannot be labeled as constants, may exhibit semi-invariant behavior.A semiinvariant variable is one that cannot be identified as aconstant at compile-time, but has a high degree of invariant behaviorat run-time. If run-time information was available to identify thesevariables as semi-invariant, they could then benefit frominvariant-based compiler optimizations. In this paper we examine theinvariance found from profiling instruction values, and show thatmany instructions have semi-invariant values even across differentinputs. We also investigate the ability to estimate the invariancefor all instructions in a program from only profiling loadinstructions. In addition, we propose a new type of profiling calledConvergent Profiling. Estimating the invariance from loads andconverg...

Title: Analysis of Techniques to Improve Protocol Processing Latency
Abstract: This paper describes several techniques designed to improveprotocol latency, and reports on their effectiveness whenmeasured on a modern RISC machine employing the DECAlpha processor. We found that the memory system---whichhas long been known to dominate network throughput---isalso a key factor in protocol latency. As a result, improvinginstruction cache effectiveness can greatly reduce protocolprocessing overheads. An important metric in this context isthe memory cycles per instructions (mCPI), which is the averagenumber of cycles that an instruction stalls waiting fora memory access to complete. The techniques presented inthis paper reduce the mCPI by a factor of 1.35 to 5.8. In analyzingthe effectiveness of the techniques, we also presenta detailed study of the protocol processing behavior of twoprotocol stacks---TCP/IP and RPC---on a modern RISC processor.1 IntroductionCommunication latency is often just as important as throughputin distributed systems, and for t...

Abstract: Run-time code generation is an alternative and complementto compile-time program analysis and optimization. Staticanalyses are inherently imprecise because most interestingaspects of run-time behavior are uncomputable. By deferringaspects of compilation to run time, more precise informationabout program behavior can be exploited, leading togreater opportunities for code improvement.The cost of performing optimization at run time is ofparamount importance, since it must be repaid by improvedperformance in order to obtain an overall speedup. This paperdescribes a lightweight approach to run-time code generation,called deferred compilation, in which compile-timespecialization is employed to reduce the cost of optimizingand generating code at run time. Implementation strategiesdeveloped for a prototype compiler are discussed, and theresults of preliminary experiments demonstrating significantoverall speedup are presented.1 IntroductionMany compiler optimizations depend ...

Toaddress this problem, researchers have proposed using languages basedon a global name space annotated with directives specifying how thedata should be mapped onto a distributed memory machine. Using theseannotations, a sophisticated compiler can automatically transform acode into a message-passing program suitable for execution on adistributed-memory machine.

The goal of demand-driven analysisis to reduce the time and/or space overhead of conventionalexhaustive analysis by avoiding the collection of informationthat is not needed. In our framework, a demand for data flowinformation is modeled as a set of data flow queries. Thederived demand-driven algorithms find responses to thesequeries through a partial reversal of the respective data flowanalysis. Depending on whether minimizing time or space isof primary concern, result caching may be incorporated inthe derived algorithm. Our framework is applicable to interproceduraldata flow problems with a finite domain set.

Title: Terminological Logics with Modal Operators
Abstract: Terminological knowledge representation formalisms can be used torepresent objective, time-independent facts about an applicationdomain. Notions like belief, intentions, time -- which are essentialfor the representation of multi-agent environments -- can only beexpressed in a very limited way. For such notions, modal logics withpossible worlds semantics provides a formally well-founded andwell-investigated basis. This paper presents a framework forintegrating modal operators into terminological knowledgerepresentation languages. These operators can be used both inside ofconcept expressions and in front of terminological and assertionalaxioms. The main restrictions are that all modal operators areinterpreted in the basic logic K, and that we consider increasingdomains instead of constant domains. We introduce syntax andsemantics of the extended language, and show that satisfiability offinite sets of formulas is decidable.

Title: Tracking the Red Queen: Measurements of Adaptive Progress in Co-Evolutionary Simulations
Abstract: . Co-evolution can give rise to the "Red Queen effect",where interacting populations alter each other's fitness landscapes.The Red Queen effect significantly complicates any measurement ofco-evolutionary progress, introducing fitness ambiguities whereimprovements in performance of co-evolved individuals can appear as adecline or stasis in the usual measures of evolutionary progress.Unfortunately, no appropriate measures of fitness given the Red Queeneffect have been developed in artificial life, theoretical biology,population dynamics, or evolutionary genetics. We propose a set ofappropriate performance measures based on both genetic and behavioraldata, and illustrate their use in a simulation of co-evolutionbetween genetically specified continuous-time noisy recurrent neuralnetworks which generate pursuit and evasion behaviors in autonomousagents. 1 Introduction Some biologists have suggested that the `RedQueen effect' arising from coevolutionary arms races has been a p...

Title: A formal framework for agency and autonomy
Abstract: With the recent rapid growth of interest in MultiAgent Systems, bothin artificial intelligence and software engineering, has come anassociated difficulty concerning basic terms and concepts. Inparticular, the terms agency and autonomy are used with increasingfrequency to denote different notions with different connotations. Inthis paper we lay the foundations for a principled theory of agencyand autonomy, and specify the relationship between them. Using the Zspecification language, we describe a three-tiered hierarchycomprising objects, agents and autonomous agents where agents areviewed as objects with goals, and autonomous agents are agents withmotivations. Introduction Although there has been substantialprogress in artificial intelligence for many years, research tendedto focus on solving problems without regard to any real externalenvironment or to the notion of a reasoning agent. In other words,the problems and their solutions, while significant, were limited int...

Title: Challenger: A Multi-agent System for Distributed Resource Allocation
Abstract: In this paper we introduce Challenger, a multiagent system thatperforms completely distributed resource allocation. Challengerconsists of agents which individually manage local resources; theseagents communicate with one another to share their resources (in thisparticular instance, CPU time) in an attempt to more efficientlyutilize them. By endowing the agents with relatively simple behaviorswhich rely on only locally available information, desirable globalsystem objectives can be obtained, such as minimization of mean jobflow time. Challenger is similar to other market-based controlsystems in that the agents act as buyers and sellers in amarketplace, always trying to maximize their own utility. The resultsof several simulations of Challenger performing CPU load balancing ina network of computers are presented.

Thedesign issues that arise when formulating this model at themolecular, cellular and organismal level are discussed, and for eachof these issues we describe how they were resolved in ourimplementation. We present and analyze some of the morphologies thatcan be explored using this model, specifically one that hasagent-like properties.

Title: The Dynamics of Reinforcement Learning in Cooperative Multiagent Systems
Abstract: Reinforcement learning can provide a robust and natural means foragents to learn how to coordinate their action choices in multiagentsystems. We examine some of the factors that can influence thedynamics of the learning process in such a setting. We firstdistinguish reinforcement learners that are unaware of (or ignore)the presence of other agents from those that explicitly attempt tolearn the value of joint actions and the strategies of theircounterparts. We study (a simple form of) Q-learning in cooperativemultiagent systems under these two perspectives, focusing on theinfluence of that game structure and exploration strategies onconvergence to (optimal and suboptimal) Nash equilibria. We thenpropose alternative optimistic exploration strategies that increasethe likelihood of convergence to an optimal equilibrium. 1Introduction The application of learning to the problem ofcoordination in multiagent systems (MASs) has become increasinglypopular in AI and game theory. ...

Theseagents are unaware of the capabilities of other agents andmay or may not be cognizant of goals to achieve.

We firstdefine a precise framework in which to study adaptive load balancing,important features of which are its stochastic nature and the purelylocal information available to individual agents. Given thisframework, we show illuminating results on the interplay betweenbasic adaptive behavior parameters and their effect on systemefficiency. We then investigate the properties of adaptive loadbalancing in heterogeneous populations, and address the issue ofexploration vs. exploitation in that context. Finally, we show thatnaive use of communication may not improve, and might even harmsystem efficiency. 1.

Partially connected computers include mobile computers suchas laptops and personal digital assistants as well as modem-connectedhome computers, all of which are often disconnected from the network.In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of ourmobile-agent system, Agent Tcl, and the specific features thatsupport mobile computers and disconnected operation. These featuresinclude network-sensing tools and a docking system that allows anagent to transparently move between mobile computers, regardless ofwhen the computers connect to the network. 1 Introduction Mobilecomputers ha...

Title: Time Limited Blackbox Security: Protecting Mobile Agents From Malicious Hosts
Abstract: . In this paper, an approach to partially solve one of the mostdifficult aspects of security of mobile agents systems is presented,the problem of malicious hosts. This problem consists in thepossibility of attacks against a mobile agent by the party thatmaintains an agent system node, a host. The idea to solve thisproblem is to create a blackbox out of an original agent. A blackboxis an agent that performs the same work as the original agent, but isof a different structure. This difference allows to assume a certainagent protection time interval, during which it is impossible for anattacker to discover relevant data or to manipulate the execution ofthe agent. After that time interval the agent and some associateddata get invalid and the agent cannot migrate or interact anymore,which prevents the exploitation of attacks after the protectioninterval.

Title: Human-computer interaction for complex pattern recognition problems, to appear
Abstract: We review some applications of human-computer interaction that alleviate the complexity of visual recognition by partitioning it into human and machine tasks to exploit the differences between human and machine capabilities. Human involvement offers advantages, both in the design of automated pattern classification systems, and at the operational level of some image retrieval and classification tasks. Recent development of interactive systems has benefited from the convergence of computer vision and psychophysics in formulating visual tasks as computational processes. Computer-aided classifier design and exploratory data analysis are already well established in pattern recognition and machine learning, but interfaces and functionality are improving. On the operational side, earlier recognition systems made use of human talent only in preprocessing and in coping with rejects. Most current content-based image retrieval systems make use of relevance feedback without direct image interaction. In contrast, some visual object classification systems can exploit such interaction. They require, however, a domain-specific visible model that makes sense to both human and computer. 1

Abstract: Robust joint visual attention is necessary for achieving a common frame of reference between humans and robots interacting multimodally in order to work together on realworld spatial tasks involving objects. We make a comprehensive examination of one component of this process that is often otherwise implemented in an ad hoc fashion: the ability to correctly determine the object referent from deictic reference including pointing gestures and speech. We develop a modular spatial reasoning framework based around decomposition and resynthesis of speech and gesture into a language of pointing and object labeling that supports multimodal and unimodal access in both real-world and mixedreality workspaces, accounts for the need to discriminate and sequence identical and proximate objects, assists in overcoming inherent precision limitations in deictic gesture, and assists in the extraction of those gestures. We further discuss an implementation of the framework that has been deployed on two humanoid robot platforms to date. 1.

Title: Interacting with Federated Devices
Abstract: . Some ubiquitous computing visions propose to embed an abundance of input and output devices in the environment. Depending on the context, the user can either interact with her limited personal device, or input and output devices from the surrounding infrastructure. But what about situations in which the user has need for the capabilities of both types of devices at the same time? A user might need to display something privately, while needing the screen real estate of a large wall mounted display. For such situations we propose using mobile devices together with those provided by the environment. We have developed a runtime environment that coordinates multiple devices to do just that. Currently we are exploring the usability of the use of multiple devices concurrently. We are also investigating the problems of authoring such interfaces. 1.

Title: The defacto system: Training tool for incident commanders
Abstract: Techniques for augmenting the automation of routine coordination are rapidly reaching a level of effectiveness where they can simulate realistic coordination on the ground for large numbers of emergency response entities (e.g. fire engines, police cars) for the sake of training. Furthermore, it seems inevitable that future disaster response systems will utilize such technology. We have constructed a new system, DE-FACTO (Demonstrating Effective Flexible Agent Coordination of Teams through Omnipresence), that integrates stateof-the-art agent reasoning capabilities and 3D visualization into a unique high fidelity system for training incident commanders. The DEFACTO system achieves this goal via three main components: (i) Omnipresent Viewer- intuitive interface, (ii) Proxy Framework- for team coordination, and (iii) Flexible Interaction- between the incident commander and the team. We have performed detailed preliminary experiments with DEFACTO in the fire-fighting domain. In addition, DEFACTO has been repeatedly demonstrated to key police and fire department personnel in Los Angeles area, with very positive feedback.

Title: An Autonomous Spherical Robot for Security Tasks
Abstract:  The use of remotely operated robotic systems in security related applications is becoming increasingly popular. However, the direct teleoperation interfaces commonly used today put a large amount of cognitive burden on the operators, thus seriously reducing the efficiency and reliability of these systems. We present an approach to alleviate this problem by exploiting both software and hardware autonomy. At the software level, we propose a variable autonomy control architecture that dynamically adapts the degree of autonomy of the robot in terms of control, perception, and interaction. At the hardware level, we rely on the intrinsic autonomy and robustness provided by the spherical morphology of our Ground-Bot robot. We also present a prototype system for facilitating the interaction between human operators and robots using our control architecture. This work is specifically aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the GroundBot robot for remote inspection tasks.

Title: The Language of Privacy: Learning from video media space analysis and design
Abstract: Video media spaces are an excellent crucible for the study of privacy. Their design affords opportunities for misuse, prompts ethical questions, and engenders grave concerns from both users and nonusers. Despite considerable discussion of the privacy problems uncovered in prior work, questions remain as to how to design a privacy-preserving video media space and how to evaluate its effect on privacy. The problem is more deeply rooted than this, however. Privacy is an enormous concept from which a large vocabulary of terms emerges. Disambiguating the meanings of and relationships between these terms facilitates understanding of the link between privacy and design. In this article, we draw from resources in environmental psychology and computersupported cooperative work (CSCW) to build a broadly and deeply rooted vocabulary for privacy. We relate the vocabulary back to the real and hard problem of designing privacy-preserving video media spaces. In doing so, we facilitate analysis of the privacy-design relationship.

Title: An ontology of virtual humans: incorporating semantics into human shapes
Abstract: semantic annotations, ontologies. Most of the efforts concerning graphical representations of humans (Virtual Humans) have been focused on synthesizing geometry for static or animated shapes. The next step is to consider a human body not only as a 3D shape, but as an active semantic entity with features, functionalities, interaction skills, etc. The ontology for Virtual Humans we are defining will provide the semantic layer  required to reconstruct, stock, retrieve and reuse content and knowledge related to Virtual Humans. The connection between the semantic and graphical data is achieved thanks to an intermediate layer based on anatomical features extracted form morphological shape analysis. The resulting shape descriptors can be used to derive higher-level descriptors from the raw geometric data. High-level descriptors can be used to control human models. 1.

Title: Auditory Display Design PhD Position Statement
Abstract: The need for alternative interaction modalities emerges from the change in requirements of users and technology alike. Pervasive and ubiquitous computing as well as the mobility of users demands methods that exploit all channels of interaction. The efficient use of audio in human-technology interaction can benefit usability and accessibility, but the lack of design guidelines most often leads to ad-hoc solutions and inappropriate use of audio. My work aims at developing a framework that allows for capturing valid design knowledge and making it available to user interface designers to create better auditory displays more effectively. The proposed approach is based on design patterns to share, re-use and transfer auditory design knowledge among designers. A method is developed to create valid patterns from common practice, individual experience and related disciplines like graphical design. To avoid auditory design being over-influenced by predominating visual concepts, our implementation of pattern design uses abstract and mode independent descriptions of user interfaces as the starting point.

In order to increase trust in agents we propose 3D Electronic Institutions as an environment inhabited by a heterogenous society of humans and agents. We present a novel approach that introduces humans to Electronic Institutions via 3D Virtual Worlds. Such a 3D Virtual World provides an immersive user interface that allows humans to observe the behavior of their agents as well as the intervention in the agents  decision process if necessary. We step beyond the agents view on Electronic Institutions, take a humancentered perspective and concentrate on the relation between humans and agents in the amalgamation of 3D Electronic Institutions. 1

Title: A Virtual Human Architecture that Integrates Kinematic, Physical and Behavioral Aspects to Control H-Anim Characters
Abstract: Virtual humans are being increasingly used in different domains. Virtual human modeling requires to consider aspects belonging to different levels of abstractions. For example, at lower levels, one has to consider aspects concerning the geometric definition of the virtual human model and appearance while, at higher levels, one should be able to define how the virtual human behaves into an environment. H-Anim, the standard for representing humanoids in X3D/VRML worlds, is mainly concerned with low-level modeling aspects. As a result, the developer has to face the problem of defining the virtual human behavior and translating it into lower levels (e.g. geometrical and kinematic aspects). In this paper, we propose VHA (Virtual Human Architecture), a software architecture that allows one to easily manage an interactive H-Anim virtual human into X3D/VRML worlds. The proposed solution allows the developer to focus mainly on high-level aspects of the modeling process, such as the definition of the virtual human behavior.

Title: Puppet Show: Intuitive Puppet Interfaces for Expressive Character Control in Medi@terra 2006, Gaming Realities: A Challenge for Digital Culture
Abstract: We argue that evolving game art like virtual performances and Machinima depend on better character control. That is why Puppet Show does not focus on new or optimized gameplay but aims to extend the expressive range of characters in an existing game world. Puppet Show is an interface plug-in for Epics Unreal Tournament 2004. Puppet Show uses an external Java program to feed visual input from a webcam onto the character animation of customized Unreal game avatars. It adds computer vision as another input device for physical puppeteering of the virtual game characters. Computer vision allows for an intuitive mapping of body movements onto virtual characters and gives human actors better access to an expressive virtual performance. We argue that this exemplifies an interface trend towards more expressive input options that support a higher level of expression in video games.

Abstract: mobile, experience design, located, situated, mediascape, HCI Mediascapes are a new medium. We use the term mediascape to describe the user experience of walking through the physical world and triggering digital media which has been situated in that place for a particular reason by the mediascape designer. Forms of mediascape include tours, situated plays, games, augmented attractions and wearable applications. What the different forms of mediascape hold in common is that the user is always mobile, rather than at a desk and the interaction mechanisms are often through movement or gesture rather than using a mouse or keyboard. Design for this new medium is still at a formative stage. It introduces a wide variety of issues for both the user and the spectator experience. This report provides an overview and practical design advice to anyone who is interested in understanding the new medium of locative media and in creating their own situated mediascape. The report is based on the collective experience of the Mobile Bristol group who have used the Mobile Bristol Authoring framework to develop a wide range of mediascapes for different purposes. The report describes both general guidelines as well as specific recommendations for designers who want to use the Mobile Bristol Authoring tools.

Abstract: This thesis presents a new 3-dimensional (3D) user interface system for a Cave Automated Virtual Environment (CAVE TM) application, based on Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Tangible User Interface (TUI). We explore fundamental 3D interaction tasks with our user interface for the CAVE TM system. User interface (UI) is comprised of a specific set of components, including input/output devices and interaction techniques. Our approach is based on TUIs using ARToolKit, which is currently the most popular toolkit for use in AR projects. Physical objects (props) are used as input devices instead of any tethered electromagnetic trackers. An off-the-shelf webcam is used to get tracking input data. A unique pattern marker is attached to the prop, which is easily and simply tracked by ARToolKit. Our interface system is developed on CAVE TM infrastructure, which is a semi-immersive environment. All virtual objects are directly manipulated with props, each of which corresponds to a certain virtual object. To navigate, the user can move the background itself, while virtual objects remain in place. The user can actually feel the props movement through the virtual space. Thus, fundamental 3D interaction tasks such as object selection, object manipulation, and navigation are performed with our interface. To feel immersion,

Title: A MDA-Compliant Environment for Developing User Interfaces of Information Systems
Abstract: . To cope with the ever increasing diversity of markup languages, programming languages, tool kits and interface development environments, conceptual modeling of user interfaces could bring a framework for specifying, designing, and developing user interfaces at a level of abstraction that is higher than the level where code is merely manipulated. For this purpose, a complete environment is presented based on conceptual modeling of user interfaces of information systems structured around three axes: the models that characterize a user interface from the end users viewpoint and the specification language that allows designers to specify such interfaces, the method for developing interfaces in forward, reverse, and lateral engineering based on these models, and a suite of tools that support designers in applying the method based on the models. This environment is compatible with the Model-Driven Architecture recommendations in the sense that all models adhere to the principle of separation of concerns and are based on model transformation between the MDA levels. The models and the transformations of these models are all expressed in UsiXML (User Interface eXtensible Markup Language) and maintained in a model repository that can be accessed by the suite of tools. Thanks to this environment, it is possible to quickly develop and deploy a wide array of user interfaces for different computing platforms, for different interaction modalities, for different markup and programming languages, and for various contexts of use. 1

Title: Social cues in animated conversational agents
Abstract: In human-computer interaction people often interpret the interaction with the computer as interactions with humans. The social agency theory suggests that social cues like the face and voice of the agent motivate this interpretation. In two off-line experiments in which comprehension scores and liking ratings were collected, we found that participants preferred natural agents with natural voices, as predicted by the social-cue hypothesis. Although female agents with male voices formed an exception, this was explained by a stereotype effect. These findings support the social-cue hypothesis and the social agency theory that human characteristics are applied in the perception of computational animated conversational agents. 2

Title: Non-hierarchical dynamic protocol composition in Jgroup/ARM
Abstract: Protocol composition is a common approach to structure generic protocols used by networked applications, and typically a vertically layered approach is taken. This paper presents an alternative approach, where the protocol composition is a weakly-coupled set of protocol modules organized in a non-hierarchical structure. Protocol modules are dynamically constructed at runtime. The approach is designed for systems that involves multiple communicating entities and multicast style interactions are supported, making the approach suitable for building reliable network applications. The main advantage of the approach is that modules in the same composition communicate by direct interaction, whereas other frameworks typically use a vertically layered protocol stack, forcing all messages/events to pass through all intermediate layers introducing unnecessary delays. 1

Title: Implementing a Metasearch Framework with Content-directed Result Merging
Abstract: A metasearch engine is a system that provides integrated access to multiple existing search engine mechanisms. Once a query is executed on a metasearch engine, the system passes the query to its participating component search engines, collects the individual results and merges them into a single ranked list. Metasearch engines increase the search coverage of the Web, help solve the extendibility issues in searching the internet, and improve the retrieval effectiveness, and consequently the relevance, of results. Result merging is a key constituent of metasearch engines. When results from several search engines are collected, the metasearch system has to merge them into a unified list. The effectiveness of the metasearch mechanism and the relevance of the result set are closely related to the result merging algorithm used. The purpose of this research is to build a flexible, general purpose metasearch framework and explore a content-directed result merging approach to rank results. Here the content-direction is provided to the framework by the user in the form of documents or text artifacts. A modular metasearch application programming interface (API) based on java has been implemented. The API framework provides interfaces and utilities to develop components of a metasearch system like segregators, scheduler, aggregators, and search service providers. A prototype metasearch engine has been built based on this framework to study the content-directed result merging algorithm.

To organize documents stored on a single peer efficiently for the search, documents are classified to the user-generated classifications. Nodes in the classification specify concepts which the user is interested in. Accordingly, the whole classification specifies the user interest profile. To provide effective search in the P2P network, peers in the network should have some ways for cooperation. In our approach, related nodes in classifications on different peers are interconnected by means of semantic links, which allow peers in the network to reason about the contents of each other and efficiently cooperate. The main foci of the current PhD thesis are the development of an algorithm for P2P Semantic Search in a distributed system of interconnected classifications; the development of a P2P Semantic search system implementing the algorithm; and the development of a testing methodology allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of the system. Keywords: P2P Search, Semantic Search, Knowledge Management. 1

Title: Under consideration for publication in Knowledge and Information Systems Effective and Efficient Classification on a Search-Engine Model
Abstract: . Traditional document classification frameworks, which apply the learned classifier to each document in a corpus one by one, are infeasible for extremely large document corpora, like the Web or large corporate intranets. We consider the classification problem on a corpus that has been processed primarily for the purpose of searching, and thus our access to documents is solely through the inverted index of a large scale search engine. Our main goal is to build the best  short query that characterizes a document class using operators normally available within search engines. We show that surprisingly good classification accuracy can be achieved on average over multiple classes by queries with as few as 10 terms. As part of our study, we enhance some of the feature-selection techniques that are found in the literature by forcing the inclusion of terms that are negatively correlated with the target class and by making use of term correlations; we show that both of those techniques can offer significant advantages. Moreover, we show that optimizing the efficiency of query execution by careful selection of terms can further reduce the query costs. More precisely, we show that on our set-up the best 10-term query can achieve 93 % of the accuracy of the best SVM classifier (14,000 terms), and if we are willing to tolerate a reduction to 89 % of the best SVM, we can build a 10-term query that can be executed more than twice as fast as the best 10-term query.

Title: Modeling scenes with local descriptors and latent aspects
Abstract: We present a new approach to model visual scenes in image collections, based on local invariant features and probabilistic latent space models. Our formulation provides answers to three open questions:(1) whether the invariant local features are suitable for scene (rather than object) classification; (2) whether unsupervised latent space models can be used for feature extraction in the classification task; and (3) whether the latent space formulation can discover visual co-occurrence patterns, motivating novel approaches for image organization and segmentation. Using a 9500-image dataset, our approach is validated on each of these issues. First, we show with extensive experiments on binary and multi-class scene classification tasks, that a bag-of-visterm representation, derived from local invariant descriptors, consistently outperforms state-of-theart approaches. Second, we show that Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) generates a compact scene representation, discriminative for accurate classification, and significantly more robust when less training data are available. Third, we have exploited the ability of PLSA to automatically extract visually meaningful aspects, to propose new algorithms for aspect-based image ranking and context-sensitive image segmentation. 1.

Title: Speech-based interactive information guidance system using question-answering technique
Abstract: This paper addresses an interactive framework for information navigation based on document knowledge base. In conventional audio guidance systems, such as those deployed in museums, the information ?ow is one-way and the content is ?xed. In order to make an interactive guidance system, we propose the application of question-answering (QA) techniques. Since users tend to use anaphoric expressions in successive questions, we investigate appropriate handling of contextual information based on topic detection, together with the effect of using N-best information in ASR output. Moreover, we apply the QA technique to generation of system-initiative information recommendation. A navigation system on Kyoto city information was implemented. Effectiveness of the proposed techniques was con?rmed through a ?eld trial by a number of real novice users. Index Terms  spoken dialogue system, questionanswering, information guidance 1.

Title: Transactional query identification in Web search
Abstract: . User queries on the Web can be classified into three types according to users intention: informational query, navigational query and transactional query. In this paper, a query type classification method and Service Link information for transactional queries are proposed. Web mediated activity is usually implemented by hyperlinks. Hyperlinks can be good indicators in classifying queries and retrieving good answer pages for transactional queries. A hyperlink related to an anchor text has an anticipated action with a linked object. Possible actions are reading, visiting and downloading a linked object. We can assign a possible action to each anchor text. These tagged anchor texts can be used as training data for query type classification. We can collect a large-scale and dynamic train query set automatically. To see the accuracy of the proposing classification method, various experiments were conducted. From experiments, I could achieve 91 % of possible improvement for transactional queries with our classification method. 1

Title: Analysis and optimization of the MODIS Leaf Area Index algorithm retrievals over broadleaf forests
Abstract: Broadleaf forest is a major type of Earths land cover with the highest observable vegetation density. Retrievals of biophysical parameters, such as leaf area index (LAI), of broadleaf forests at global scale constitute a major challenge to modern remote sensing techniques in view of low sensitivity (saturation) of surface reflectances to such parameters over dense vegetation. The goal of the performed research is to demonstrate physical principles of LAI retrievals over broadleaf forests with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI algorithm and to establish a basis for algorithm refinement. To sample natural variability in biophysical parameters of broadleaf forests, we selected MODIS data subsets covering deciduous broadleaf forests of the eastern part of North America and evergreen broadleaf forests of Amazonia.

Title: UMass at TREC 2004: Novelty and HARD
Abstract: For the TREC 2004 Novelty track, UMass participated in all four tasks. Although finding relevant sentences was harder this year than last, we continue to show marked improvements over the baseline of calling all sentences relevant, with a variant of tfidf being the most successful approach. We achieve 59 % improvements over the baseline in locating novel sentences, primarily by looking at the similarity of a sentence to earlier sentences and focusing on named entities. For the High Accuracy Retrieval from Documents (HARD) track, we investigated the use of clarification forms, fixed- and variable-length passage retrieval, and the use of metadata. Clarification form results indicate that passage level feedback can provide improvements comparable to user supplied related-text for document evaluation and outperforms related-text for passage evaluation. Document retrieval methods without a query expansion component show the most gains from related-text. We also found that displaying the top passages for feedback outperformed displaying centroid passages. Named entity feedback resulted in mixed performance. Our primary findings for passage retrieval are that document retrieval methods performed better than passage retrieval methods on the passage evaluation metric of binary preference at 12,000 characters, and that clarification forms improved passage retrieval for every retrieval method explored. We found no benefit to using variable-length passages over fixed-length passages for this corpus. Our use of geography and genre metadata resulted in no significant changes in retrieval performance.

Title: Automatic document indexing in large medical collections
Abstract: Term extraction relates to extracting the most characteristic or important terms (words or phrases) in a document. This information is commonly used for improving the accuracy of document indexing and retrieval in large text collections. It also allows for faster and better understanding of the contents of a document collection without first browsing through the contents of its documents. This paper presents AMTEX, an automatic term extraction method, specifically designed for the automatic indexing of documents in large medical collections such as MEDLINE, the premier bibliographic database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM). AMTEX combines MeSH, the terminological thesaurus resource of NLM, with a well-established method for extraction of domain terms, the C/NC-value method. The performance evaluation of various AMTEX configurations in the indexing task is measured against the current state-of-the-art, the MMTx method. The experimental results on a subset of MEDLINE documents demonstrate that AMTEX achieves better precision and recall than MMTx.

Title: A Motion Trajectory Based Video Retrieval System Using Parallel Adaptive Self Organizing
Abstract:  We present a novel motion trajectory based video retrieval system using parallel adaptive self organizing maps (PASOMs) in this paper. The motion trajectories are extracted from video sequences by a robust tracker using detection-based particle filter. To reduce the high dimension of motion trajectories and achieve flexible video retrieval, our algorithm first decomposes each raw motion trajectory into subtrajectories by using a maximum acceleration based approach. Each subtrajectory is then modeled and coded by two different methods, polynomial curving fitting and independent component analysis. To fuse the different features of subtrajectories for more efficient and flexible retrieval, we use a PASOMs network as the searching tool where each SOM learns and classifies one feature. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed approach for video retrieval comparing with prior approaches. I.

In this paper we test intuitive predictions about the availability of knowledge on the Web about a set of concepts from information science. Intuition is defined as a general expectation of a tendency, based on repeated observations of the external (knowledge) environment. Spline interpolation is applied to the available data, which predicts slight decline of the number of hits on concepts like artificial intelligence  and data mining. The number of publications on information retrieval  and recommender systems  is expected to increase, also in the context of new information systems for cardiology.

Title: Abstract Automatic Content-Based Filtering of Television News
Abstract: With the ever-increasing flow of information, the need for computer-automated tools for handling information becomes greater and greater. News shows and other television broadcasts carry vast amounts of information, but generally in forms that are not reachable through conventional information retrieval techniques. During the last couple of years, researchers around the world have given considerable attention to the problem of extracting semantic information from television and re-representing it in a form suitable for automatic indexing and searching. Detailed content information in a television broadcast is typically found in teletext subtitles (if such are available), text embedded in the video image, and in the spoken dialogue. Extracting it involves using techniques associated with signal processing, image analysis, artificial intelligence, speech recognition, etc. A reliable filter system for use in e.g. Scandinavia, where only a few of the television broadcasts are teletext-subtitled, must take advantage of information in all three forms, or modalities. The presented report contains a survey of current research projects in this area and a theoretical design of a modular, multi-modal, content-based television filter, based on findings in the

Title: Chisel: A storage-efficient, collision-free hash-based packet processing architecture
Abstract: Longest Prefix Matching (LPM) is a fundamental part of various network processing tasks. Previously proposed approaches for LPM result in prohibitive cost and power dissipation (TCAMs) or in large memory requirements and long lookup latencies (tries), when considering future line-rates, table sizes and key lengths (e.g., IPv6). Hash-based approaches appear to be an excellent candidate for LPM with the possibility of low power, compact storage, and O(1) latencies. However, there are two key problems that hinder their practical deployment as LPM solutions. First, naive hash tables incur collisions and resolve them using chaining, adversely affecting worst-case lookup-rate guarantees that routers must provide. Second, hash functions cannot directly operate on wildcard bits, a requirement for LPM, and current solutions require either considerably complex hardware or large storage space. In this paper we propose a novel architecture which successfully addresses for the first time, both key problems in hash based LPM  making the following contributions: (1) We architect an LPM solution based upon a recently-proposed, collision-free hashing scheme called Bloomier filter, by eliminating its false positives in a storage efficient way. (2) We propose a novel scheme called prefix collapsing, which provides support for wildcard bits with small additional storage and reduced hardware complexity. (3) We exploit prefix collapsing and key characteristics found in real update traces to support fast and incremental updates, a feature generally not available in collision-free hashing schemes.

Title: Document Space Adapted Ontology: Application in Query Enrichment
Abstract: . Retrieval of correct and precise information at the right time is essential in knowledge intensive tasks requiring quick decision-making. In this paper, we propose a method for utilizing ontologies to enhance the quality of information retrieval (IR) by query enrichment. We explain how a retrieval system can be tuned by adapting ontologies to provide both an in-depth understanding of the user's needs as well as an easy integration with standard vector-space retrieval systems. The ontology concepts are adapted to the domain terminology by computing a feature vector for each concept. The feature vector is used to enrich a provided query. The ontology and the whole retrieval system are under development as part of a Semantic Web standardization project for the Norwegian oil and gas industry. 1

Title: Design and Evaluation of a Recommender System
Abstract: In the recent years, the Web has undergone a tremendous growth regarding both content and users. This has lead to an information overload problem in which people are finding it increasingly difficult to locate the right information at the right time. Recommender systems have been developed to address this problem, by guiding users through the big ocean of information. Until now, recommender systems have been extensively used within e-commerce and communities where items like movies, music and articles are recommended. More recently, recommender systems have been deployed in online music players, recommending music that the users probably will like. This thesis will present the design, implementation, testing and evaluation of a recommender system within the music domain, where three different approaches for producing recommendations are utilized. Testing each approach is done by first conducting live user experiments and then measure recommender precision using offline analysis. Our results show that the functionality of the recommender system is satisfactory, and that recommender precision differs for the three filtering approaches. v

Title: User profile generation based on a memory retrieval theory
Abstract: : Several statistical approaches for user profiling have been proposed in order to recognize users  information needs during their interaction with information sources. Human memory processes in terms of learning and retrieval are with no doubt some of the fundamental elements that take part during this interaction, but actually only a few models for user profiling have been devised considering explicitly these processes. For this reason, a new approach for user modeling is proposed. The grounds in the well-studied Search of Associative Memory (SAM) model provides a clear definition of the structure to store information and the processes of learning and retrieval. These assets are missing in other works based for example on simplified versions of semantic memory models and co-occurrence data. We will prove how from this approach it is possible to build a model that can be applied in the context of Internet browsing activities. The evaluation shows interesting results in comparison with a standard user modeling approach. The recognition of the current search context and the ability to return important keywords that can be used in a filtering process are some of the advantages of that approach. 1

Title: Position specific posterior lattices for indexing speech
Abstract: The paper presents the Position Specific Posterior Lattice, a novel representation of automatic speech recognition lattices that naturally lends itself to efficient indexing of position information and subsequent relevance ranking of spoken documents using proximity. In experiments performed on a collection of lecture recordings  MIT iCampus data  the spoken document ranking accuracy was improved by 20 % relative over the commonly used baseline of indexing the 1-best output from an automatic speech recognizer. The Mean Average Precision (MAP) increased from 0.53 when using 1-best output to 0.62 when using the new lattice representation. The reference used for evaluation is the output of a standard retrieval engine working on the manual transcription of the speech collection. Albeit lossy, the PSPL lattice is also much more compact than the ASR 3-gram lattice from which it is computed  which translates in reduced inverted index size as well  at virtually no degradation in word-error-rate performance. Since new paths are introduced in the lattice, the OR-ACLE accuracy increases over the original ASR lattice.

Instead of depending on attributes or annotations to search desired data from long-time archived video, our system allows users to perform content-based similarity search using visual and audio features, and to combine content-based similarity search with traditional search methods. Our preliminary experience and evaluation shows that contentbased similarity search is easy to use and can achieve 0.79 average precision on our simple benchmark. The system is constructed using Ferret toolkit and its memory footprint for metadata is small, requiring about 1.4Gbytes for one year of continuous archived video data.

Title: Query Terms Abstraction Layers
Abstract: . A problem with traditional information retrieval systems is that they typically retrieve information without an explicitly defined domain of interest to the user. Consequently, the system presents a lot of information that is of little relevance to the user. Ideally, the queries  real intentions should be exposed and reflected in the way the underlying retrieval machinery can deal with them. In this paper we propose using abstraction layers to differentiate on the query terms. We explain why we believe this differentiation of query terms is necessary and the potentials of this approach. The whole retrieval system is under development as part of a Semantic Web standardization project for the Norwegian oil and gas industry. 1

Title: Scalable collaborative filtering using cluster-based smoothing
Abstract: Memory-based approaches for collaborative filtering identify the similarity between two users by comparing their ratings on a set of items. In the past, the memory-based approaches have been shown to suffer from two fundamental problems: data sparsity and difficulty in scalability. Alternatively, the model-based approaches have been proposed to alleviate these problems, but these approaches tends to limit the range of users. In this paper, we present a novel approach that combines the advantages of these two kinds of approaches by introducing a smoothing-based method. In our approach, clusters generated from the training data provide the basis for data smoothing and neighborhood selection. As a result, we provide higher accuracy as well as increased efficiency in recommendations. Empirical studies on two datasets (EachMovie and MovieLens) show that our new proposed approach consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms.

Title: A Peer-to-Peer Architecture for Information Retrieval Across Digital Library Collections
Abstract: . Peer-to-peer networks have been identified as promising architectural concept for developing search scenarios across digital library collections. Digital libraries typically offer sophisticated search over their local content, however, search methods involving a network of such stand-alone components are currently quite limited. We present an architecture for highly-efficient search over digital library collections based on structured P2P networks. As the standard single-term indexing strategy faces significant scalability limitations in distributed environments, we propose a novel indexing strategykey-based indexing. The keys are term sets that appear in a restricted number of collection documents. Thus, they are discriminative with respect to the global document collection, and ensure scalable search costs. Moreover, key-based indexing computes posting list joins during indexing time, which significantly improves query performance. As search efficient solutions usually imply costly indexing procedures, we present experimental results that show acceptable indexing costs while the retrieval performance is comparable to the standard centralized solutions with TF-IDF ranking. 1

Title: Just-In-Time Indexing for Interactive Data Exploration
Abstract: Interactive search of complex data poses significant challenges for traditional indexing methods because of the infeasibility of determining an effective set of indices a priori. This paper proposes just-in-time indexing, a new strategy that mitigates these challenges by exploiting a key characteristic of interactive data exploration: iterative query refinement. During the refinement process, just-in-time indexing takes advantage of user think time to create indices on-the-fly for query terms likely to be relevant to the current user. Moreover, because a user typically refines a query after observing only a subset of the results, justin-time indexing indexes only subsets of the data at a time. We present strategies for selecting which query terms to index at any point in time, balancing the needs of the current user (immediate workload) versus the projected needs of future users (long-term workload). We have implemented just-in-time indexing in the Diamond architecture and validated its effectiveness for exploring image databases.

Title: Textual CBR Authoring using Case Cohesion
Abstract: . During the design phase of a textual case-based reasoning (TCBR) system, decisions have to be made regarding the internal representation of the cases and the similarity metrics. Such decisions have a significant impact on the performance of the resulting TCBR system. We believe that guidance should be provided to the designer during the authoring process. Unfortunately most of the metrics proposed in the CBR literature either require subjective human evaluation or do not apply when both problem and solution parts of the cases are textual in nature. In this paper, we propose a metric, case cohesion that can be used to provide guidance in the configuration of a case base and in the selection of appropriate similarity schemes. Case cohesion is defined from the neighborhood of textual cases and allows to estimate whether both problem and solution descriptions are well aligned. Our experimental results indicate that case cohesion can discriminate among the performances of different retrieval schemes and can also help in the unsupervised selection of the parameters required for these retrieval metrics. 1

Abstract: . We describe our experiments for the Image CLEF medical retrieval task. Our efforts were focused on the initial visual search. A content based approach was followed. We used texture, localisation and colour features that have been proven by previous experiments. The images in the collection had specific characteristics. Medical images have a formulaic composition for each modality and anatomic region. We were able to choose features that would perform well in this domain. Tiling a Gabor texture feature to add localisation information proved to be particularly effective. The distances from each feature were combined with equal weighting. This smoothed the performance across the queries. The retrieval results showed that this simple approach was successful, with our system coming third in the evaluation. 1

Title: DL meets P2P  distributed document retrieval based on classification and content
Abstract: . Peer-to-peer architectures are a potentially powerful paradigm for retrieving documents over networks of digital libraries avoiding single points of failure by massive federation of (independent) information sources. Today sharing files over P2P infrastructures is already immensely successful, but restricted to simple metadata matching. But when it comes to the retrieval of complex documents, capabilities as provided by digital libraries are needed. Digital libraries have to cope with compound documents. Though some document parts (like embedded images) can efficiently be retrieved using metadata matching, the text-based information needs different methods like full text search. However, for effective querying of texts, also information like inverted document frequencies are essential. But due to the distributed characteristics of P2P networks such collection-wide  information poses severe problems, e.g. that central updates whenever changes in any document collection occur use up valuable bandwidth. We will present a novel indexing technique that allows to query using collection-wide information with respect to different classifications and show the effectiveness of our scheme for practical applications. We will in detail discuss our findings and present simulations for the schemes efficiency and scalability. 1

Title: Conflict-directed relaxation of constraints in content-based recommender systems
Abstract: . Content-based recommenders are systems that exploit detailed knowledge about the items in the catalog for generating adequate product proposals. In that context, query relaxation is one of the basic approaches for dealing with situations, where none of the products in the catalogue exactly matches the customer requirements. The major challenges when applying query relaxation are that the relaxation should be minimal (or optimal for the customer), that there exists a potentially vast search space, and that we have to deal with hard time constraints in interactive recommender applications. In this paper, we show how the task of finding adequate or customer optimal relaxations for a given recommendation problem can be efficiently achieved by applying techniques from the field of model-based diagnosis, i.e., with the help of extended algorithms for computing conflicts and hitting sets. In addition, we propose a best-effort search algorithm based on branch-and-bound for dealing with hard problems and also describe how an optimal relaxation can be immediately obtained when partial queries can be (pre-)evaluated. Finally, we discuss the results of an evaluation of the described techniques, which we made by extending an existing knowledge-based recommender system and which we based on different real-world problem settings.

Title: Using Bloom filters to refine web search results
Abstract: Search engines have primarily focused on presenting the most relevant pages to the user quickly. A less well explored aspect of improving the search experience is to remove or group all near-duplicate documents in the results presented to the user. In this paper, we apply a Bloom filter based similarity detection technique to address this issue by refining the search results presented to the user. First, we present and analyze our technique for finding similar documents using contentdefined chunking and Bloom filters, and demonstrate its effectiveness in compactly representing and quickly matching pages for similarity testing. Later, we demonstrate how a number of results of popular and random search queries retrieved from different search engines, Google, Yahoo, MSN, are similar and can be eliminated or re-organized. 1.

The Web can be seen as one huge digital library offering a variety of very useful information for business analysts. INSYDER addresses these possibilities and offers powerful retrieval and visualisation functionalities. The main focus during the development was on the usability of the system. Therefore, a variety of well-established visualisation components were employed to support the user during the information-seeking process (e.g. visual query, result table, bar graph, segment view with tile bars, and scatterplot). Also, the retrieval aspects were developed with the goal of increasing the usability of the system (e.g. natural language search, content-based classification, relevance feedback). Extensive evaluations of the retrieval performance and the usability of the visualisation were conducted. The results of these evaluations offered many helpful insights into developing a new visual-informationseeking system called VisMeB.

Abstract: In this paper basic concepts of machine learning and data mining are introduced. Machine learning algorithms extract knowledge from diverse data bases that can be used to build decision-making systems. For example, based on the operational engineering data, equipment faults can be detected, the number of items to be ordered can be predicted, optimal control parameters can be determined. A framework for organizing and applying knowledge for decision-making in manufacturing and service applications is presented. The framework uses decision-making constructs such decision tables, decision maps, and atlases. It offers a new data-driven paradigm of importance to modern manufacturing and service organisations. Examples of data mining applications in industrial, medical, and pharmaceutical domains are presented. It is envisioned that the data-driven framework presented in the paper will enhance these applications.

Title: IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, 2005 1 Context-Based Object-Class Recognition and Retrieval by Generalized Correlograms.
Abstract: We present a novel approach for retrieval of object categories based on a novel type of image representation: the Generalized Correlogram (GC). In our image representation, the object is described as a constellation of GCs where each one encodes information about some local part and the spatial relations from this part to others (i.e. the parts context). We show how such a representation can be used with fast procedures that learn the object category with weak supervision and efficiently match the model of the object against large collections of images. In the learning stage, we show that by integrating our representation with Boosting the system is able to obtain a compact model that is represented by very few features, where each feature conveys key properties about the objects parts and their spatial arrangement. In the matching step, we propose direct procedures that exploit our representation for efficiently considering spatial coherence between the matching of local parts. Combined with an appropriate data organization such as Inverted Files, we show that thousands of images can be evaluated efficiently. The framework has been applied to the standard CALTECH database with seven object categories and clutter, and we show that our results are favorably compared against state-of-the-art methods in both computational cost and accuracy.

However, Semantic Web ontologies are based on crisp logic and do not provide well-defined means for expressing uncertainty. We present a new probabilistic method to approach the problem. In our method, degrees of subsumption, i.e., overlap between concepts can be modeled and computed efficiently using Bayesian networks based on RDF(S) ontologies. Degrees of overlap indicate how well an individual data item matches the query concept, which can be used as a well-defined measure of relevance in information retrieval tasks. 1 Ontologies and Information Retrieval A key reason for using ontologies in information retrieval systems, is that they enable the representation of background knowledge about a domain in a machine understandable format. Humans use background knowledge heavily in information retrieval tasks [7]. For example, if a person is searching for documents about Europe she will use her background knowledge about European countries in the task. She will find a document

Title: Traffic Accident Analysis Using Machine Learning Paradigms. Informatica 29:8998
Abstract: Engineers and researchers in the automobile industry have tried to design and build safer automobiles, but traffic accidents are unavoidable. Patterns involved in dangerous crashes could be detected if we develop accurate prediction models capable of automatic classification of type of injury severity of various traffic accidents. These behavioral and roadway accident patterns can be useful to develop traffic safety control policies. We believe that to obtain the greatest possible accident reduction effects with limited budgetary resources, it is important that measures be based on scientific and objective surveys of the causes of accidents and severity of injuries. This paper summarizes the performance of four machine learning paradigms applied to modeling the severity of injury that occurred during traffic accidents. We considered neural networks trained using hybrid learning approaches, support vector machines, decision trees and a concurrent hybrid model involving decision trees and neural networks. Experiment results reveal that among the machine learning paradigms considered the hybrid decision tree-neural network approach outperformed the individual approaches.

Title: Enhancing the security of corporate Wi-Fi networks using DAIR
Abstract: We present a framework for monitoring enterprise wireless networks using desktop infrastructure. The framework is called DAIR, which is short for Dense Array of Inexpensive Radios. We demonstrate that the DAIR framework is useful for detecting rogue wireless devices (e.g., access points) attached to corporate networks, as well as for detecting Denial of Service attacks on Wi-Fi networks. Prior proposals in this area include monitoring the network via a combination of access points (APs), mobile clients, and dedicated sensor nodes. We show that a dense deployment of sensors is necessary to effectively monitor Wi-Fi networks for certain types of threats, and one can not accomplish this using access points alone. An ordinary, single-radio AP can not monitor multiple channels effectively, without adversely impacting the associated clients. Moreover, we show that a typical deployment of access points is not sufficiently dense to detect the presence of rogue wireless devices. Due to power constraints, mobile devices can provide only limited assistance in monitoring wireless networks. Deploying a dense array of dedicated sensor nodes is an expensive proposition. Our solution is based on two simple observations. First, in most enterprise environments, one finds plenty of desktop machines with good wired connectivity, and spare CPU and disk resources. Second, inexpensive USB-based wireless adapters are commonly available. By attaching these adapters to desktop machines, and dedicating the adapters to the task of monitoring the wireless network, we create a low cost management infrastructure.

Title: Distributed channel assignment in multi-radio 802.11 mesh networks
Abstract:  802.11 wireless mesh networks are an attractive alternative to wired local and metropolitan area networks. To increase the utilization of the 802.11 spectrum in these environments, recent work has explored how to utilize the entire 802.11 spectrum when transmitting data through the mesh network. This paper reports on our design of a distributed, self-stabilizing protocol that assigns channels to mesh nodes in large-scale mesh networks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our protocol on a realworld, 14-node testbed comprised of nodes, each equipped with an 802.11a card and an 802.11g card. We show via extensive measurments on our testbed that our channel assignment algorithm improves the network capacity by 50 % in comparison to a homogeneous channel assignment and by 20 % in comparison to a random assignment. Furthermore, our protocol provides particular benefit to flows over long paths which would otherwise suffer poor end-to-end performance due to wireless interference. I.

Title: Multipath Routing with Load Balancing in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks
Abstract: In recent years, routing research concerning wired networks has focused on minimizing the maximum utilization of the links which is equivalent to reducing the number of bottlenecks while supporting the same traffic demands. This can be achieved using multipath routing with load balancing instead of single path routing using of routing optimizers. However, in the domain of ad hoc networks multipath routing has not been investigated in depth. We would like to develop an analogy between wired and wireless networks, but before that we need to identify the major differences between these two in the case of multipath routing. First, in order to increase the network throughput, the multiple paths have to be independent so they don't share the same bottlenecks. Then, due to radio propagation properties the link capacity is not constant. So using the maximum utilization metric for wireless networks is not suitable. Based on the research done in wired networks, which has shown that

Title: A Unified Energy-Efficient Topology for Unicast and Broadcast
Abstract: We propose a novel communication efficient topology control algorithm for each wireless node to select communication neighbors and adjust its transmission power, such that all nodes together self-form a topology that is energy efficient simultaneously for both unicast and broadcast communications. We prove that the proposed topology is planar, which guarantees packet delivery if a certain localized routing method is used; it is power efficient for unicast  the energy needed to connect any pair of nodes is within a small constant factor of the minimum under a common power attenuation model; it is efficient for broadcast: the energy consumption for broadcasting data on top of it is asymptotically the best compared with structures constructed locally; it has a constant bounded logical degree, which will potentially reduce interference and signal contention. We further prove that the average physical degree of all nodes is bounded by a small constant. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first communication-efficient distributed algorithm to achieve all these properties. Previously, only a centralized algorithm was reported in [3]. Moreover, by assuming that the ID and position of every node can be represented in O(log n) bits for a wireless network of n nodes, our method uses at most 13n messages, where each message is of O(log n) bits. We also show that this structure can be efficiently updated for dynamical network environment. Our theoretical results are corroborated in the simulations.

Title: TCP with Adaptive Pacing for Multihop Wireless Networks
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel congestion control algorithm for TCP over multihop IEEE 802.11 wireless networks implementing rate-based scheduling of transmissions within the TCP congestion window. We show how a TCP sender can adapt its transmission rate close to the optimum using an estimate of the current 4-hop propagation delay and the coefficient of variation of recently measured round-trip times. The novel TCP variant is denoted as TCP with Adaptive Pacing (TCP-AP). Opposed to previous proposals for improving TCP over multihop IEEE 802.11 networks, TCP-AP retains the end-to-end semantics of TCP and does neither rely on modifications on the routing or the link layer nor requires cross-layer information from intermediate nodes along the path. A comprehensive simulation study using ns-2 shows that TCP-AP achieves up to 84 % more goodput than TCP NewReno, provides excellent fairness in almost all scenarios, and is highly responsive to changing traffic conditions.

Title: Wireless sensor network security: A survey, in book chapter of Security
Abstract: As wireless sensor networks continue to grow, so does the need for effective security mechanisms. Because sensor networks may interact with sensitive data and/or operate in hostile unattended environments, it is imperative that these security concerns be addressed from the beginning of the system design. However, due to inherent resource and computing constraints, security in sensor networks poses different challenges than traditional network/computer security. There is currently enormous research potential in the field of wireless sensor network security. Thus, familiarity with the current research in this field will benefit researchers greatly. With this in mind, we survey the major topics in wireless sensor network security, and present the obstacles and the requirements in the sensor security, classify many of the current attacks, and finally list their corresponding defensive measures. 2

Title: NISC Technology and Preliminary Results
Abstract: A common way of improving an applications performance is implementing it on a custom hardware. High level synthesis (HLS) and application specific instruction-set processor are two alternatives for automating this process. HLS techniques usually can handle small programs. Also, since the datapath is not available during scheduling, limited datapath and layout optimizations (such as interconnect pipelining) are possible in HLS. On the other hand, to run an application on a custom hardware, ASIP approaches require the extra phases of designing custom instructions and implementing them in both instruction decoder and compiler. In this report, we present theNISC approach where an application is directly compiled on a given datapath. The compiler does not use any instruction abstraction and directly generates the control signal values of datapath components in each clock cycle. The generated architecture is called No-Instruction-Set-Computer (NISC). In this report, we present the core compiler algorithm followed by two sets of experimental results, one focusing on architecture reuse and the other one on designing a custom architecture for a given application. Having a fine-grained control over the datapath, our compiler can generate up to 70 % better performance compared to an instruction-set- based compiler according to our preliminary results. Also, by designing a custom datapath for DCT algorithm, we could achieve 7 times speedup, 1.64 times power reduction, 12.5 times energy savings, and more than 3 times area reduction compared to a soft-core MIPS implementation. i Contents

Title: Facilitating the search for compositions of program transformations
Abstract: Static compiler optimizations can hardly cope with the complex run-time behavior and hardware components interplay of modern processor architectures. Multiple architectural phenomena occur and interact simultaneously, which requires the optimizer to combine multiple program transformations. Whether these transformations are selected through static analysis and models, runtime feedback, or both, the underlying infrastructure must have the ability to perform long and complex compositions of program transformations in a flexible manner. Existing compilers are ill-equipped to perform that task because of rigid phase ordering, fragile selection rules using pattern matching, and cumbersome expression of loop transformations on syntax trees. Moreover, iterative optimization emerges as a pragmatic and general means to select an optimization strategy via machine learning and operations research. Searching for the composition of dozens of complex, dependent, parameterized transformations is a challenge for iterative approaches. The purpose of this article is threefold: (1) to facilitate the automatic search for compositions of program transformations, introducing a richer framework which improves on classical polyhedral representations, suitable for iterative optimization on a simpler, structured search space, (2) to illustrate, using several examples, that syntactic code representations close to the operational semantics hamper the composition of transformations, and (3) that complex compositions of transformations can be necessary to achieve significant performance benefits. The proposed framework relies on a unified polyhedral representation of loops and statements. The key is to clearly separate four types of actions associated with program transformations: iteration domain, schedule, data layout and memory access functions modifications. The framework is implemented within the Open64/ORC compiler, aiming for native IA64, AMD64 and IA32 code generation, along with source-to-source optimization of Fortran90, C and C++. 1

Title: Compiling for resource-constrained platforms using ASSHes: Application- and system-specific heuristics
Abstract: We present and evaluate application- and system-specific heuristics (ASSHes) for optimizing embedded software. ASSHes are scripts that decide which compiler optimizations to apply; they make decisions using feedback from previous compilations, using the results of program analyses, and using high-level information, e.g., there are only 4 KB of RAM, and interrupt handlers 57 should be fast since we expect them to execute very frequently.  In contrast, traditional compilers base optimization decisions on built-in heuristics that are oblivious to high-level application- and platform-specific concerns. The ASSH effectively becomes the high-level optimization policy and the existing compiler becomes a low-level mechanism for applying code transformations. ASSHes are more generic than previous approaches to compiling embedded software: they permit compilation to be directed towards meeting many different goals and combinations of goals. So far we have investigated ASSHes that control two optimizations: loop unrolling and function inlining. We evaluate ASSHes by applying them to TinyOS sensor network applications, where they have successfully reduced resource usage. For example, for one large application we can either reduce worst-case stack depth by 16%, reduce code size by 3.5%, or reduce the amount of time the processor is active by 14 % (our baseline for comparison is the output of the nesC compiler, which itself performs aggressive crossmodule inlining). These various improvements conflict: they can be achieved individually but not togetherdealing with tradeoffs among resources is central to designing efficient embedded systems. 1.

Title: Automatic performance model construction for the fast software exploration of new hardware designs
Abstract: Developing an optimizing compiler for a newly proposed architecture is extremely difficult when there is only a simulator of the machine available. Designing such a compiler requires running many experiments in order to understand how different optimizations interact. Given that simulators are orders of magnitude slower than real processors, such experiments are highly restricted. This paper develops a technique to automatically build a performance model for predicting the impact of program transformations on any architecture, based on a limited number of automatically selected runs. As a result, the time for evaluating the impact of any compiler optimization in early design stages can be drastically reduced such that all selected potential compiler optimizations can be evaluated. This is achieved by first evaluating a small set of sample compiler optimizations on a prior set of benchmarks in order to train a model, followed by a very small number of evaluations, or probes, of the target program. We show that by training on less than 0.7 % of all possible transformations (640 samples collected from 10 benchmarks out of 880000 possible samples, 88000 per training benchmark) and probing the new program on only 4 transformations, we can predict the performance of all program transformations with an error of just 7.3 % on average. As each prediction takes almost no time to generate, this scheme provides an accurate method of evaluating compiler performance, which is several orders of magnitude faster than current approaches.

Title: Heap Data Allocation to Scratch-Pad Memory in Embedded Systems
Abstract:  This paper presents the first-ever compiletime method for allocating a portion of the heap data to scratch-pad memory. A scratch-pad is a fast directly addressed compiler-managed SRAM memory that replaces the hardware-managed cache. It is motivated by its better real-time guarantees vs cache and by its significantly lower overheads in access time, energy consumption, area and overall runtime. Existing compiler methods for allocating data to scratch-pad are able to place only global and stack data in scratch-pad memory; heap data is allocated entirely in DRAM, resulting in poor performance. Runtime methods based on software caching can place heap data in scratchpad, but because of their high overheads from software address translation, they have not been successful, especially for heap data. In this paper we present a dynamic yet compiler-directed allocation method for heap data that for the first time, (i) is able to place a portion of the heap data in scratch-pad; (ii) has no software-caching tags; (iii) requires no run-time per-access extra address translation; and (iv) is able to move heap data back and forth between scratch-pad and DRAM to better track the programs locality characteristics. With our method, global, stack and heap variables can share the same scratch-pad. When compared to placing all heap variables in DRAM and only global and stack data in scratch-pad, our results show that our method reduces the average runtime of our benchmarks by 34.6%, and the average power consumption by 39.9%, for the same size of scratch-pad fixed at 5 % of total data size.

Title: Ontology translation for interoperability among semantic web services
Abstract: Research on semantic web services promises greater interoperability among software agents and web services by enabling content-based automated service discovery and interaction, utilizing shared ontologies published on the semantic web. However, services produced and described by different developers may well use different, perhaps partly overlapping sets of ontologies, just as it is common that relational database schemas for similar or related functions are only partly compatible. Once again, interoperability will depend on ontology mappings and architectures supporting the associated translation processes. The question we ask is, will the traditional approach of introducing mediator agents to translate messages between requestors and services work in such an open environment? This article reviews some of the processing assumptions that were made in the development of the semantic web service modeling ontology OWL-S [OWL-S] and argues that, as a practical matter, the translation function cannot always be isolated in mediators. Ontology mappings will need to be published on the semantic web just as ontologies themselves are. The translation for service discovery, service process model interpretation, task negotiation, service invocation and response interpretation may then be distributed to various places in the architecture, so that translation can be done in the specific goal-oriented informational contexts of the agents performing these processes. We present arguments for assigning translation responsibility to particular agents in the cases of service invocation, response translation and matchmaking.

Title: The STROBE model: Dynamic Service Generation on the Grid
Abstract: This article presents the STROBE model: both an agent representation and an agent communication model based on a social approach, that means interaction centred. This model represents how agents may realise the interactive, dynamic generation of services on the Grid. Dynamically generated services embody a new concept of service implying a collaborative creation of knowledge i.e. learning; services are constructed interactively between agents depending on a conversation. The approach consists of integrating selected features from Multi-Agent Systems and agent communication, language interpretation in applicative/functional programming and e-learning/human-learning into a unique, original and simple view that privileges interactions, yet including control. The main characteristic of STROBE agents is that they develop a language (environment + interpreter) for each of their interlocutors. The model is inscribed within a global approach, defending a shift from the classical algorithmic (control based) view to problem solving in computing to an interaction-based view of Social Informatics, where artificial as well as human agents operate by communicating as well as by computing. The paper shows how the model may not only account for the classical communicating agent approaches, but also represent a fundamental advance in modelling societies of agents in particular in Dynamic Service Generation scenarios such as those necessary today on the Web and proposed tomorrow for the Grid. Preliminary concrete experimentations illustrate the potential of the model; they are significant examples for a very wide class of computational and learning situations.

Title: A service creation environment based on end to end composition of web services
Abstract: The demand for quickly delivering new applications is increasingly becoming a business imperative today. Application development is often done in an ad hoc manner, without standard frameworks or libraries, thus resulting in poor reuse of software assets. Web services have received much interest in industry due to their potential in facilitating seamless business-to-business or enterprise application integration. A web services composition tool can help automate the process, from creating business process functionality, to developing executable workflows, to deploying them on an execution environment. However, we find that the main approaches taken thus far to standardize and compose web services are piecemeal and insufficient. The business world has adopted a (distributed) programming approach in which web service instances are described using WSDL, composed into flows with a language like BPEL and invoked with the SOAP protocol. Academia has propounded the AI approach of formally representing web service capabilities in ontologies, and reasoning about their composition using goal-oriented inferencing techniques from planning. We present the first integrated work in composing web services end to end from specification to deployment by synergistically combining the strengths of the above approaches. We describe a prototype service creation environment along with a use-case scenario, and demonstrate how it can significantly speed up the time-tomarket for new services.

Title: Verification of protocol conformance and agent interoperability
Abstract: . In open multi-agent systems agent interaction is usually ruled by public protocols defining the rules the agents should respect in message exchanging. The respect of such rules guarantees interoperability. Given two agents that agree on using a certain protocol for their interaction, a crucial issue (known as a priori conformance test) is verifying if their interaction policies, i.e. the programs that encode their communicative behavior, will actually produce interactions which are conformant to the agreed protocol. An issue that is not always made clear in the existing proposals for conformance tests is whether the test preserves agents capability of interacting, besides certifying the legality of their possible conversations. This work proposes an approach to the verification of a priori conformance, of an agents conversation policy to a protocol, which is based on the theory of formal languages. The conformance test is based on the acceptance of both the policy and the protocol by a special finite state automaton and it guarantees the interoperability of agents that are individually proved conformant. Many protocols used in multi-agent systems can be expressed as finite state automata, so this approach can be applied to a wide variety of cases with the proviso that both the protocol specification and the protocol implementation can be translated into finite state automata. In this sense the approach is general. Easy applicability to the case when a logic-based language is used to implement the policies is shown by means of a concrete example, in which the language DyLOG, based on computational logic, is used. 1

Title: Protocol engineering for web services conversations
Abstract: Although web services aim to bring about seamless and effective communication in a wide variety of Internet applications, the interactions between them are currently limited to simple requestresponse exchanges. However, in the longer term we believe this is unsustainable. In particular, we believe that more complex protocols for web service conversations are necessary if the participants are to tailor their needs and offers to the prevailing context and they are to coordinate multiple services in open and realistic environments. To this end, this paper combines and extends two recent web service languages, WS-Conversation Language (WSCL) and WS-Agreement, in order to obtain a method for engineering protocols of sufficient expressiveness for the next generation of flexible and autonomous services. Specifically, we propose that the protocols include speech-acts as the individual messages and we show how to model such speech-acts as WS-Agreement schemas, which can, in turn, be imported into the specification of the protocols in WSCL. To demonstrate our approach, we express a standard contracting protocol in the extended WSCL/ WS-Agreement languages. Furthermore, we use statechart notation as a visual counterpart to help developers write clients that flexibly interact with a service and to help users to better understand how to interact with a service. Finally, we show that the translation between statecharts and WSCL/WS-Agreement protocols is straightforward.

Title: Capability Survey of Japanese User Agents and Its Impact on Web Accessibility
Abstract: Capabilities of major Japanese user agents, three screen readers and one voice browser, were investigated with the following test files: W3C UAAG 1.0 Test Suite for HTML 4.01, an accessible PDF file, an accessible Flash file, and test files which test Japanese specific issues. Using the UAAG 1.0 Test Suite, 20 out of 48 Priority 1 checkpoints were met by all user agents, while all of the user agents failed to meet 11 of the checkpoints. Test results of all test files were assigned into three categories: capabilities satisfied by almost all user agents, capabilities not satisfied by any of the user agents, and capabilities that were satisfied by some of the user agents only. The test results indicated that 1) two major Japanese user agents do not have enough functions to navigate through a Web page using the structure information of the content, and 2) none of the user agents have enough functions to control multimedia and timedependent interactions. These results provide an objective evidence to define the Japanese baseline, a set of technologies that a user agent is assumed to support, which is required in the WCAG 2.0 working draft. Accessibility responsibility between Web content and user agents is also determined by the current survey.

Title: Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems
Abstract: There are quite a few solutions for crew scheduling, including some commercial applications. The same happens for aircraft scheduling and for flight scheduling including revenue management. However, the airline operations problem did not receive the same attention has the other airline scheduling problems. Some companies like Carmen Systems AB and The Sabre Group have research teams dedicated to this topic. In this paper Im proposing the development of a Distributed Multi-agent System that will be capable of dealing with the crew and aircraft recovery problem, during the airline operations phase. The MAS will be able to deal with different operational bases and all bases will cooperate to find the solutions to the local problems. Robustness will be a key feature and I will try to achieve that through redundancy in finding the possible solutions to the problem. To be an Intelligent System  some kind of learning must be available. Ill use learning to define the crew members profile, to learn the use of stand by crew members and include this learning in future crew scheduling and in suggesting new solutions based on previous decisions. Finally, I would like to explore the possibility of having a kind of electronic market  for available crew members/aircrafts among airline companies, to be used in crew and aircraft recovery. This would work as a market  of solutions to specific local problems and these solutions would compete with the recommended local solutions. To develop the system the latest MAS methodologies, frameworks, tools and technologies will be used. This includes GAIA [1], JADE [2], Agent-web services and IBM Rational [3] suite of tools.
