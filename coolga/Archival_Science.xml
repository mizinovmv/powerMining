brazil: the establishment of a scientific discipline and its impact on training archivists in the era of information and knowledge </title><content>this article addresses the trajectory of archival science in brazil, its extracurricular characteristics and its particular relationship with information science within academics, its institutional associations, and some considerations regarding current training for archivists in brazil. the methodological procedures used included analyzing documents from the national archive fonds of brazil, reviewing archive literature, and interviewing people involved in consolidating archival science. this study concludes that archival science research is taking place in graduate programs throughout public brazilian universities and points out that people working with archives now have more advanced training, such as undergraduate degrees in archival science or other. this study also focuses on archives as information units, while presenting and reflecting on the demands of training archivists who are faced with the challenges of the working world and the era of information and knowledge&amp;#8212;challenges that go beyond merely technical procedures and encompass dynamic planning and orientation activities. </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Alistair G  Tough  </authors><title>archives in sub-saharan africa half a

internet access </title><content>archival repositories have enthusiastically begun to digitize their holdings in order to make them more widely available via the internet; however, copyright issues influence what is selected for online access. this article reports the findings of a study that investigated how copyright affects what items canadian archival repositories select for digitization and online access. the study found that canadian repositories select items that are perceived to incur little risk of copyright infringement (because the copyright has expired or because the repository owns the copyright), or those that require few or no resources to investigate copyright status or obtain copyright authorizations. the findings suggest that repositories&amp;#8217; selection decisions are more restrictive than the law requires; because they want to avoid copyright complications, they are making available online fewer holdings than they could.

</title><content>archives have the potential to change people&amp;#8217;s lives. they are created to enable the conduct of business and accountability, but they also support a democratic society&amp;#8217;s expectations for transparency and the protection of rights, they underpin citizen&amp;#8217;s rights and are the raw material of our history and memory. this paper examines these issues in the context of the historical development of archives and archivists in twentieth century england. the research lays the foundations for understanding how and why the modern archives and records management profession developed in england. this paper will investigate the historical conflict (or is it a continuum?) between archives as culture and as evidence. the story identifies and highlights the contributions made by many fascinating individuals who established archives services and professional practice in england in the twentieth century. they shaped the archive in a very real way, and their individual enthusiasms, interests and understandings set the course of the english archival profession. to a great extent, it was these individuals, rather than government or legislation, that set the boundaries of english archives, they decided what was included (acquired) and what was not (of archival value.) the conclusion will consider the more fundamental questions: what are archives and what are they for, or perhaps, &amp;#8216;what good are the archives&amp;#8217;? </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Niels Windfeld Lund  | Michael Buckl|

article pursues the varying understandings of the photograph in archival literature. an in-depth review of the scholarship uncovers several possible reasons why archivists and those writing about photographic archives apparently continue to struggle with the photograph, including: the sheer difficulty that photographs as an elusive medium present; past debates about photography in art history, history, and archival literature; and the challenges that the photograph as an evasive document presents to the contradictory nature of archives themselves and to conceptions of archival science. having evolved from an understanding of photographs that conflated content with meaning to postmodernist notions of contingent and plural meanings in which photographs participate, archival writings on the photograph hold promise as they begin to tread the waters that schwartz charted in the last 15;years. this paper follows that historical progression in order to trace the discourse on photographic archives that has emerged over the past three decades. </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>David Beard  </authors><title>from work to text to document

the key term offers challenges for contemporary humanities research. in making our own movement from work to text to document, we can explicate fully the complexity of conducting archival humanistic research within disciplinary and institutional contexts in the twenty-first century. this essay calls for a complex perspective, one that demands that we understand the raw materials of scholarship are processed by disciplines, by institutions, and by the work of the scholar. when we understand our materials as constrained by disciplines, we understand them as &amp;#8220;works.&amp;#8221; when we understand them as constrained by the institutions of memory that preserve and grant access to them, we understand them as &amp;#8220;documents.&amp;#8221; and when we understand them as the ground for our own interpretive activity, we understand them as &amp;#8220;texts.&amp;#8221; when we understand that humanistic scholarship requires an awareness of all three perspectives simultaneously (an understanding demonstrated by case studies in historical studies of the discipline of rhetoric), we will be ready for a richer historical scholarship as well as a richer collaboration between humanists and archivists. </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Nathan Riley Johnson  </authors><title>technical documents as rhetorical agency </title><content>this research argues that documents can become intermediaries which affect the relationships between disparate groups. through a critical analysis of materials distributed during an online protest, the author traces the life of a single technical document, simultaneously describing how it was described during deliberation between several groups. marcusean critical theory and rhetorical criticism framed the analysis. it is suggested that certain documents act as a locus between otherwise unaffiliated groups and that those documents become agents who can mediate deliberation. further, it is suggested that document analysis can become an important aspect for interpreting group relationships. future research examining the agency of documents is suggested.

we can verify a considerable advance in theory. the result is a proliferation of archivistics handbooks, and of publications that show the development of specialised archivistics, the mechanisation of archivistic operations, and the concern about basic matters such as documental selection, studies on documental typologies, the diverse models of archival classification with an application of organic-functional criteria, an application of isad(g) to documental description, the legal problems of access to documents and the conservation of heritage, and the newest of the electronic documents. to sum up, there is a strong advance in archivistics theory and practice among archivistics professionals, although the existence of a specific academic degree is still pending.

whose daily duties centered around writing and receiving letters and other documents, a flood of written material was produced. the management and archiving of all this material triggered the formation of new institutions, of new methods of working, and of new personnel. though the results of the efforts at archiving were often fitful and incomplete, the governments of the italian

inventories and political knowledge in early modern switzerland and europe </title><content>the comparative study of archival inventories in early modern switzerland reveals that three major regimes of inventorying logic emerged from the late fifteenth to the early eighteenth century. early inventories constructed as lists gave way first to ideal-topographical inventories that relied on a double mapping of conceptual spaces against archival space and inventory pages, succeeded eventually by taxonomic inventories oriented around an active state apparatus and its needs. synchronic and diachronic comparisons that focus on major reorganizations have proven effective in illustrating the scope and effectiveness of each of the successive regimes. a similar approach applied to major inventory projects across early modern europe may identify further systems for making accumulating documents accessible to rulers, and may also allow us to trace genealogies of inventory practice regimes as they appeared in different regions, at different scales, and in diverse political contexts. </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Eric Ketelaar

and accessibility </title><content>this article explains the re-engineering of the government records disposition program at library and archives canada (lac) in 2002&amp;#8211;2004. the main point is that the framework of accountability has grown since the launch of the macroappraisal program (often referred to as the planned approach to disposition) at the (former) national archives of canada (na) in 1990&amp;#8211;1991. the opportunity for building an expanded framework of accountability presented itself after 2000 when a number of &amp;#8220;push&amp;#8221; (internal to the disposition program) and &amp;#8220;pull&amp;#8221; (external to the program) factors coalesced to challenge a reduced program. the re-engineering exercise involved lac government records archivists working together to develop the following new program documentation: government-wide plan (gwp); memorandum of understanding (mou); appraisal checklist; terms and conditions for the transfer of archival records; briefing note for the librarian and archivist of canada; and the multi-institutional disposition authority (mida) for operational case files. significant work also went into creating version three of the records disposition authorities control system (rdacs). as a result of re-engineering the appraisal and disposition program, there is an accountability framework now in place for more than keep-destroy recommendations, one that has moved beyond disposition to include acquisition of and accessibility to the archival record.

archivists in general, and israeli archivists in particular. today, israeli archives face several issues: acceptance of international standards and their adaptation to the conditions and needs of israeli archival data bases; creation of tools for information retrieval, particularly a comprehensive thesaurus to be used by all archival institutions or a basic thesaurus which can be developed in accordance with the needs of individual archives. the article discusses the standardization that has begun in archival description outside of israel, and various proposed solutions for information retrieval from meta-data or the content of the documents by means of thesaurus-based indexing. two unique projects, representing different outlooks, are described: the thesaurus of the national insurance institute of israel, partially based upon that of the henrietta szold institute, and that of the archives of religious zionism at bar-ilan university, created ex nihilo on the basis of the meta-data and the documentation itself. in addition, a comparison is conducted of elements of isad(g) adopted by the israel state archives and the archives of religious zionism. the article concludes

science, thehistorical-technicist paradigm, has its origins with the french revolution and raised from the social, economic, political, ideological and cultural changes that occur during the 19th and 20th centuries. during this last one and due specially to the technological revolution archival science reinforced its technical component and became autonomous in face of history, but the consolidation of the model, based on a custodial, technicist and documentalist perspective, is associated to a knowledge essentially empirical. by effect of the new conditions generated by information society, the dominant paradigm entered into a crisis and developed inside itself the factors which, unavoidably, will produce the paradigm shift. the new paradigm &amp;#8212; thescientific-informational paradigm &amp;#8212; conceives archival science as an applied discipline into the scope of information science and defines unequivocally its object of study &amp;#8212; the archive, understood as aninformation system &amp;#8212; and its scientific method of research. the method tends to find consolidation through quadripolar research dynamics, which is operated and

</authors><title>archives, memory, and interfaces with the past </title><content>archival interfaces are critical nodes in archival systems where archivists negotiate and exercise power over the constitution and representation of archives. drawing on notions of interfaces from physical, technological, and computer systems, archival interfaces are both a metaphor for archivists' roles as intermediaries between documentary evidence and its readers and a tangible set of structures and tools that place archival documents in a context and provide an interpretative framework. interfaces in modern institutions and technological systems are neither natural nor neutral. in probing archival interfaces, what may appear as neutral and objective processes are revealed as places where archivists determine what constitutes legitimate evidence of the past and shape social memories. the emergence of computer interfaces as an increasingly common mode of user interaction with archives demands that archivists confront the interpretative nature of their work and exploit opportunities to place themselves visibly in the interfaces they construct.

</title><content>this article is the continuation and conclusion of our introduction, as the guest editors, that appeared in the first of these two special issues ofarchival science, which together are devoted to the theme, &amp;#8220;archives, records, and power.&amp;#8221; it argues that, in performing their work, archivists follow a script that has been naturalized by the routine repetition of past practice. they act in ways that they anticipate their various audiences would desire. if archival practice is to be influenced by the postmodern ideas of the authors of the essays in these two volumes, then archivists must see that the script, stage, and audiences have changed. theory and practice are not opposites, not even polarities, but integrated aspects of the archivist's professional role and responsibility. transparency of process about the archivist's performance will facilitate this integration, stimulate the building of archival knowledge, and enable present and future generations to hold the profession accountable for its choices in exercising power over the making of modern memory. </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Joan M  Schwartz   | Terry Cook  </authors><title>archives, records, and power: the making of modern memory </title><content>this article serves as the general introduction by the guest editors to the first of two thematic issues ofarchival science that will explore the theme, &amp;#8220;archives, records, and power.&amp;#8221; archives as institutions and records as documents are generally seen by academic and other users, and by society generally, as passive resources to be exploited for various historical and cultural purposes. historians since the mid-nineteenth century, in pursuing the new scientific history, needed an archive that was a neutral repositories of facts. until very recently, archivists obliged by extolling their own professional myth of impartiality, neutrality, and objectivity. yet archives are established by the powerful to protect or enhance their position in society. through archives, the past is controlled. certain stories are privileged and others marginalized. and archivists are an integral part of this story-telling. in the design of record-keeping systems, in the appraisal and selection of a tiny fragment of all possible records to enter the archive, in approaches to subsequent and ever-changing description and preservation of the archive, and in its patterns of communication and use, archivists continually reshape, reinterpret, and reinvent the archive. this represents enormous power over memory and identity, over the fundamental ways in which society seeks evidence of what its core values are and have been, where it has come from, and where it is going. archives, then, are not passive storehouses of old stuff, but active sites where social power is negotiated, contested, confirmed. the power of archives, records, and archivists should no longer remain naturalized or denied, but opened to vital debate and transparent accountability. </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Richard J  Cox  </authors><title>are there really new

government departments, and other institutions that are charged with the responsibility of managing these records either throughout or at various stages of their life cycle. to date, archivists and records administrators, both in canada and worldwide, have recognized the case file challenge and are rethinking solutions for dealing with this persistent problem. this article argues that by building on our cumulative knowledge acquired through years of applying macroappraisal and functional analysis to the appraisal of government records, and staking out a modern definition of &amp;#8220;case file records&amp;#8221; based on their transactional characteristics, we indeed do have the skills and the expertise to tackle the problem and develop a new solution for case file records. rather than taking a piecemeal approach or relying on sampling techniques, library and archives canada (lac) case files appraisal working group (cfawg) {core members of cfawg have included:

</title><content>anthropologists engaged in post-colonial studies are increasingly adopting an historical perspective and using archives. yet their archival activity tends to remain more an extractive than an ethnographic one. documents are thus still invoked piecemeal to confirm the colonial invention of certain practices or to underscore cultural claims, silent. yet such mining of thecontent of government commissions, reports, and other archival sources rarely pays attention to their peculiar placement andform. scholars need to move from archive-assource to archive-as-subject. this article, using document production in the dutch east indies as an illustration, argues that scholars should view archives not as sites of knowledge retrieval, but of knowledge production, as monuments of states as well as sites of state ethnography. this requires a sustained engagement with archives as cultural agents of &amp;#8220;fact&amp;#8221; production, of taxonomies in the making, and of state authority. what constitutes the archive, what form it takes, and what systems of classification and epistemology signal at specific times are (and reflect) critical features of colonial politics and state power. the archive was the supreme technology of the late nineteenth-century imperial state, a repository of codified beliefs that clustered (and bore witness to) connections between secrecy, the law, and power. </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Jonathan Furner  </authors><title>conceptual analysis: a method for understanding information as evidence, and evidence as

once, use many times: the clever use of recordkeeping metadata for multiple archival Purposes</title><content>metadata is a key component in the creation, management and preservation of electronic records, as well as their innovative use as archives, memory and knowledge. however metadata generation and deployment are currently resource intensive and application specific. metadata creation is not usually fully automated. metadata created in one application of potential relevance to other applications is not shared between applications. although data modeling, mark up language and syntax initiatives are addressing the data representation requirements for metadata translation and exchange, this functionality has not as yet been utilized in the systems that support egovernment and ebusiness processes, electronic recordkeeping and archival description. moreover there has been little progress in relation to developing strategies and meta-tools for the translation of metadata attributes and values between schemas in these environments. the monash clever recordkeeping metadata (crkm) project addresses the challenge of automating metadata creation and sharing metadata between business systems, current recordkeeping systems and archival systems. this paper explores the relevance of the crkm project to future archival systems and the deployment of metadata for multiple archival purposes. it is presented as part of the smart metadata and the archives of the future session that aims to communicate the progress and findings of several inter-related collaborative research projects and standards initiatives. other papers in the session report on the related work of the interpares 2 description research team (designing a meta-registry for the

on works carried out for a research which was subsidized from 1997 to 2000 by the social sciences and humanities research council of canada (sshrc). the goal of this study was to examine the general tendencies of education and research in archival science. first, a review of the literature published from 1985 to 1998 allowed us to establish a state of the art. then, a survey was completed with a questionnaire which has been sent to educational institutions, national archives institutions and researchers. answers were received from more than 70 different countries. with regards to the education program, the analysis of data shows that there have seen notable progresses. more than the growth of the number of programs, we must especially recognize the constant improvement of its contents, which is achieved in conformity with the propositions made in the literature. as for the research, it exists a community of ideas about fields and themes to be privileged even if there is an apparent division of the researchers into two groups. the first group distinguishes itself by its cohesion by unanimously recognizing a small number (nine) of priorities in research in archival science. the second group shows multiple interests which cover 30 research themes. the author conclude in saying that the development of education and research in archival science are on their way, but nothing has yet been won. it is important to accentuate the efforts to insure a durable life to education and research as pillars of the discipline.

</title><content>the paper focuses on the convergence of finnish research and education in archival science with information science in general and in records management with information management in particular. two issues influencing this development are: the convergence of professionals previously worked in the archival and library sectors and in information management and services; and the wide-spread, extensive growth in the use of digital technology to manage internal and external organizational information. at the level of society the opportunities provided by digital technology to manage heritage information in memory organizations like archives, libraries and museums, are tremendous and the role of documentary heritage at the global, european and national levels is well recognized. these developments are changing the information and operating environments of memory organizations and public and private enterprises. these changes, in turn, are generating new requirements in archival science and records management education and research. this paper focuses on the implications of these changes for the planning, implementation and further development of an information studies curriculum. this curriculum development is considered crucial in order to respond to the new demands, and is also implicitly linked to the emerging finnish information society.

increasing reliance on electronic documentation, to-date archives remain, largely, material repositories of cultural memory. it is an accepted historical problematic, however, that culture is often resistant to material preservation. there exists an undeniable and profound tension between scholarly efforts to reconstruct history and interpret cultural traditions and the fragmentary, and often limited, material record. that is to say, scholarship is shaped by a sinuous negotiation around the historical silences that encompass all of material culture.historical silences, however, can at times be marginalized (or at best excluded) by a sensitive configuration of material evidence with oral history. excluding archival silences: oral history and historical absence uses a historically and geographically specific example of oral history to engage in a more generalist discussion of how oral reflection, especially when shaped by material evidences, can be an especially effective tool for preserving the dynamics of culture that often remain undocumented.</content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Evelyn Wareham  </authors><title>from explorers to evangelists: archivists, recordkeeping, and remembering in the pacific islands </title><content>with a central focus on the cultural contexts of pacific island societies, this essay examines the entanglement of colonial power relations in local recordkeeping practices. these cultural contexts include the on-going exchange between oral and literate cultures, the aftermath of colonial disempowerment and reassertion of indigenous rights and identities, the difficulty of maintaining full archival systems in isolated, resource-poor &amp;#8220;micro-states,&amp;#8221; and the driving influence of development theory. the essay opens with a discussion of concepts of exploration and evangelism in cross-cultural analysis as metaphors for archival endeavor. it then explores the cultural exchanges between oral memory and written records, orality, and literacy, as means of keeping evidence and remembering. after discussing the relation of records to processes of political and economic disempowerment, and the reclaiming of rights and identities, it returns to the patterns of archival development in the pacific region to consider how archives can better integrate into their cultural and political contexts, with the aim of becoming more valued parts of their communities. </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Erva Kostiainen  | Marjo Rita Valtonen  | Pertti

national archives of canada, and the strategic and program infrastructure developed in the 1990s to turn the new theory into operational reality. as no archival concept is universally locked in time, the evolution and changes in the macroappraisal program, both in theory and strategy, are also analysed in its canadian home base over its first decade, as well as some internal and external criticisms of it. the essay intends to illuminate the deeper context of macroappraisal, so that an international audience may better understand its strengths and weaknesses. as the author is the

approach gives the impression that we are moving into the 21st century with three competing scientific traditions of interpretation. another understanding is the systemic view, which indicates a paradigm with complementing traditions of interpretation, depending on ontological level. the paradigm of archival science is, like that of many other sciences, influenced by positivism, systems theory and hermeneutics. the relevance of the paradigm depends on personal beliefs. the hermeneutic understanding of archival science emphasizes the context and deconstructs central concepts. hermeneutics emphasizes the influence of conceptual changes and technological advances on perception. hermeneutics stresses the need for a socio-cultural and historical orientation of archival science. the positivistic tradition is coloured by the myths about an ideal science. this is reflected firstly in the analogy comparing archives with nature, and secondly in the deductive method. positivism is instrumental in its demands for distinct definitions of concepts and its insistence on the record as the basis of archival science. the flexibility of systems theory highlights the complex relations between context and record. systems theory can, at its best, serve as a meeting-place for researchers, archivists and users and accordingly form the basis for new knowledge and theory formation. systems theory enables a materialistic/dialectic epistemology based in reality and inspired by other relevant sciences. the result may be the foundation of a systemic-functionalist archival science with activities, records creation and evidential values in focus. </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Livia Iacovino  </authors><title>multi-method

social science research techniques, as well as legal and ethics research tools drawn from law and moral philosophy, together with disciplinary discourse analysis, concept mapping and empirical

scientific methods in archival science as a whole from this postmodernistic approach. so far the debate on archival science has not taken appropriate consideration of the development of scientific methods of our science. in order to establish the necessary basis for an analysis of the scientific methods of the discipline it is necessary to specify the different areas and subareas of archival

1900 and 1950 </title><content>the organization of registries emerged in the first world war to become a persistent problem in the british civil service. registry services and control of information and records were the key issues. the treasury's re-organizations beginning in 1919 and continuing into the 1960s, and subsequent changes in its registry in 1920, 1928, 1938, and 1944, highlight contemporary concerns for efficiency and better control over information and practices. despite lip service to the importance of official knowledge in records, models were imperfectly implemented. by 1950, official records were only a small part of the treasury's recorded communications and the ideal model of a central registry service was giving way to local applications in sub-registries serving functional communities. registries were as much social practices as the were rule-guided systems for information artefacts. </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Barbara L  Craig

constructing meanings </title><content>the authors of this essay, coming from very different traditions and modes of archival discourse, explore together archival description as a field of archival thinking and practice. their shared conviction is that records are always in the process of being made, and that the stories of their making are parts of bigger stories understandable only in the ever-changing broader contexts of society. the exploration begins with an interrogation of the traditional and ever-valid questions of the what and the why of archival description. thereafter they offer a deconstruction of these questions and of the answers commonly proffered. in these sections of the essay their concern is with descriptive architecture, the analysis covering a number of specific architectures and including only oblique references to descriptive standardization. the concluding section attempts to draw out the implications of their analysis for endeavours&amp;#8212;irrespective of the architectures being used &amp;#8212; to define, and to justify, descriptive standards. their call is not to dispense with standardization, but rather to create space for a liberatory approach which engages creatively the many dangers of standardization. </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Eric Ketelaar |  |   </authors><title>tacit

article examines the claim that, through its overt symbolic messaging, the gatineau preservation centre, opened by the national archives of canada in 1997, embodies a perfect transparency between function and form, with the shape of the place being derived seamlessly from the needs of the archival work done there, and the proof being in the exposure of all the elements to view. it reveals the undercurrents of contending oppositions to this claim, both in the subversive, mannerist, or &amp;#8220;impure&amp;#8221; architectural eccentricities designed into the structure, and in the embodiment of archival narratives whose symbolism is challenged by unacknowledged resistances. while the building is clearly inspired by modernist and enlightenment orientations, such as the ambition to preserve unchanged a universal, transcendent historical authenticity, these diverse resistances buried in it are manifested, for example, in the contest of maleversus female structural elements, and in the authority of the monumental and exposed set against the seduction of the varied and secret. most importantly, the absorption of the body both metaphorically and physically into the many disciplines of the place unconsciously calls into question the building's self-image as the epitome of a liberal-humanist and objective-scientific activity; it reflects instead the destabilizing plays and displays of power which are increasingly seen to form the indeterminate field of the archival pursuit. </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Verne Harris  </authors><title>the

the author ruminates on the relationship between collecting and archival appraisal. he argues that collecting does not necessarily equal appraisal, although society and even archivists value it as an important function. the author stresses that the critical need is for archivists to have a clear perspective, whether highly theoretical or immensely practical, of what it is they hope to accomplish in appraising and that they need to document this process so that future researchers and archivists can understand what archival appraisal meant. as it is, archives might become more valued as important cultural symbols than for the records they actually hold. the notion of an &amp;#8220;end&amp;#8221; of collecting is in the sense that collecting is appraising, but appraising elevated to a professional function requiring more care, deliberate thought, and self-evaluation. </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Thea Miller </authors><title>the german registry: the

metadata infrastructure supporting the creation, preservation and use of trustworthy records: developing the interpares 2 metadata schema Registry</title><content>this paper argues that an essential component of electronic recordkeeping needs to be an infrastructure to support the creation, preservation and accessibility over time of trustworthy, understandable metadata. this infrastructure can then also be used to provide specifications and an implementation environment for automated tools to assist archivists in the ongoing management of trustworthy records and metadata, and users in the identification, retrieval, and manipulation of those records and metadata. the paper discusses this need in the context of the development by the international research on permanent authentic records in electronic systems (interpares 2) description cross-domain group of a metadata schema registry. this registry is a prototype resource designed to assist archivists and records creators in multiple domains in developing and assessing their own and other communities&amp;#8217; metadata infrastructures. the paper concludes by identifying two contested issues that are surfaced and how they are being confronted by this work: one of these is a definitional issue that relates to how to delineate the concept of archival description in the face of competing notions of &amp;#8220;metadata.&amp;#8221; the other is the extent to which both the life cycle and continuum worldviews and associated activities can or should be supported, reconciled or even re-thought

</authors><title>what is recorded is never simply &amp;#8216;what happened&amp;#8217;: record keeping in modern organizational culture </title><content>traditional premises in archival theory and practice hold that archival records are authentic as to procedure and impartial as to creation because they are created as a means for, and as a by-product of, action, and not for the sake of posterity. such positivist assumptions about the nature of records have come under sustained scrutiny in the archival literature over the past decade. the post-positivist view of records embraces the record as a socially constructed and maintained entity. this paper situates itself within this new paradigm in an exploration of the beginning of the life of the record. it is therefore concerned with the creator (or recorder) and the social construction of the record. in expanding beyond a purely administrative- and juridical-based theory of records, this paper draws upon research from other disciplines, such as sociology, in order to place records and record keeping within a framework that allows for an understanding of their social nature. in particular, the goal is to determine the underlying social factors that directly influence and shape the creation and keeping of records and to begin to understand how these factors manifest themselves in the construction of the record.

paths to partial truths&amp;#8217;: archives, anthropology, and the power of representation </title><content>this essay compares thinking about anthropology and archives, in light of recent postmodern analysis. while many in the social sciences and humanities have been considering issues of representation, objectivity, and power, archival thinking has remined largely isolated from this broader intellectual landscape, and archival practice has remained curiously bound up in modes of thought and practice distinctly rooted in nineteenth-century positivism. archivists have even resisted the efforts of those within their own ranks to challenge this isolation and re-situate the premises of archival identity in this newer and larger intellectual context. this essay suggests that archivists can draw meaningful comparisons by reading outside their field in disciplines, such as anthropology, with which archives shares key features, such as concern with issues of representation, description, and culture. in this essay, select anthropological writings throughout the last century are examined against a backdrop of trends in archival thinking, contrasting the tumultuous epistemological debate within anthropology with the relative calm in the archival profession. this contrast is strikingly embodied by the coincidence of the publication, in 1922, and both in london, of leading theorists from both fields: bronislaw malinowski and hilary jenkinson. the essay suggests that, in order to remain relevant and conversant with their partners and stakeholders, archivists must take the matter of their isolation seriously, exercise more comparative self-reflection, and devise practical ways to do archival work without the positivist blinders of the past.

the treaty of paris in 1898, spain ceded to the united states all its colonial authority over the philippines, including its other colonies. the treaty also placed in american possession the spanish records kept in the various agencies of the former colonial administration of the islands. upon assumption of its role as the new de facto colonial regime, the american insular government initiated the process of collecting the spanish colonial records to be housed in a central repository that became the nucleus of the national archives of the philippines. an important aspect of understanding the context of archives in post-colonial philippines is to trace its early beginnings and to examine the archives&amp;#8217; association with former colonial powers. established against the backdrop of the shift in the continuum of colonial regimes, the archive is undeniably a colonial creation and a manifestation of colonial domination. for the contemporary imagination, however, its very presence represents a common and collective past that consequently contributes to the formation of a &amp;#8220;national consciousness&amp;#8221; and ironically reinforces the idea of nationhood of

a research method. a modified electronic version of the technique was used which was qualitative rather than quantitative and not focussed on the more usual consensus building. the article concludes that a delphi study is a practical technique for conducting research which seeks to gather views from geographically dispersed participants in a timely, time-effective and convenient manner for all those involved. the use of a modified delphi study proved to be extremely valuable in facilitating discussions of complex emergent issues about the role, value and nature of standards for records management, in particular iso 15489, and about the future of iso 15489, at a higher level of abstraction. the article makes a contribution in two areas: first in terms of the views of a group of leading international records management experts on the first international standard in records management; and second, in terms of the use of a research method which has previously been little used in the records management discipline. </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Filip Boudrez  </authors><title>digital signatures and electronic records </title><content>this paper

evolution of written records as proof of jural acts in england, 11th to 17th century </title><content>this article traces the trajectory from distrust to trust in written records as proof of the conveyance of land in england between the eleventh and seventeenth centuries. during that period of time, such records were transformed from an aide-memoire of an essentially oral act, to the indisputable proof of the act they recorded and, finally, to the very embodiment of the act itself. the article focuses specifically on one particular class of conveyance, i.e., transfers of freehold interests in land held by free tenure, on one particular form of conveyance, i.e., feoffments with livery of seisin, and on one particular type of record, i.e., the charters that recorded such conveyances. the article concludes that the ascension of written proof by the end of the 17th century is attributable to a number of factors, among them, the growth of royal jurisdiction over land, the rise of literacy, the growth of commerce, and an increasing distrust on the part of the judiciary in the capacity of a lay jury to properly assess written records.

icpsr&amp;#8217;s ingest and access operations to the open archival information system (oais) reference model. the paper also assesses icpsr&amp;#8217;s conformance with the archival responsibilities of &amp;#8220;trusted&amp;#8221; oais repositories, with the proviso that audit criteria for archival certification are still under development. the icpsr to oais mapping exercise has benefits for the larger social science archiving community because it provides an interpretation of the reference model in the quantitative social science environment and points to preservation-related issues that may be salient for other social science archives. building on the archives&amp;#8217; long tradition of shared norms and cooperation, we may ultimately be able to design a federated system of trusted

past, the developments in these two worlds have been rather separate. there are however signs that they are converging in the digital world. in particular, this can be seen in the areas of metadata and internet dissemination as these are strongly influenced by the rapid changes in information technology. these changes have also led to important new developments in the infrastructure of research data to which special attention is paid. new concepts such as collaboratories, data curation, open access and the open archives initiative are discussed.

end of the nineteenth century </title><content>this paper takes up terry cook&amp;#8217;s idea that through their work, archivists are active shapers rather than passive keepers. in taking this idea further, this paper discusses a case study comparing the custodial history of two archival groups of east india companies&amp;#8217; archives, the voc and eic archives, during the second half of the nineteenth century, and how archival practitioners influenced their arrangement and description. consideration is given on how archival practice (good and bad) and professional discussion contributed to the understanding of the importance of provenance and original order and the need for sound methodology for analysis of the records to precede arrangement and descriptions. the work undertaken by the archivists on the voc archives in the netherlands in particular, took place at a time during the development of the landmark archival standard (the 1898 dutch manual). this study looks at how the arrangement of the voc and eic archives reflects these contemporary theoretical discussions. the voc archives in the netherlands were one of the first archival groups of business records to be arranged using the 1898 dutch manual&amp;#8217;s advice. at the same time, in england, those working on the eic archives in london understood the importance of custodial history and its influence on the arrangement of the eic archives. through an analysis of the work of those involved in the arrangement and description of the voc and eic archives, this paper argues that it is possible to see the emergence of fundamental archival principles such as the difference between physical arrangement and intellectual control, and the development of these ideas derived from discussions during the writing of the 1898 dutch manual and their translation into archival practice. </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Wendy M  Duff  | Joan M  Cherry  | Nalini Singh

records </title><content>this paper considers the shaping and reshaping of, and intersections between, aboriginal and non-aboriginal communication, information, and documentation processes in british columbia, from the mid 1800s to the 21st century. it suggests that when two cultures come into contact with each other, the relationship between them is inevitably transformed, along with each culture&amp;#8217;s traditional methods of communication, information management, and memory making. while it is often assumed that one technology might dominate the other, more often the different technologies and methods blend together to create a new hybrid approach, a cross-cultural integration, though the less powerful culture often does most of the accommodating. by considering the relationship between aboriginal people and european settlers in british columbia, on the west coast of canada, particularly over the ownership of and rights to land, this paper suggests that the two societies have intertwined their communities, their cultures, and their documentary systems to the point that today neither society exists in isolation. each culture is inextricably linked with the other, a fact that calls into question the idea that aboriginal oral traditions are &amp;#8220;pure&amp;#8221; or separate from non-aboriginal methods of documentation, as well as the notion that written forms of record keeping about aboriginal&amp;#8211;non-aboriginal relationships are not influenced by oral evidence from aboriginal sources.

archivists. there were two significant events in the last 140;years that defined the types of records created and maintained within the church namely: vatican i and vatican ii. after the suspension of vatican i and the promulgation of pastor aeternus, we begin to see a centralization in ecclesiastical governance structures, due in part to interpretations of papal primacy. this centralization of church authority eventually impinged upon the recordkeeping processes of dioceses. however after vatican ii the pendulum shifted with the promulgation of the decree concerning the pastoral office of the bishop and the re-introduction of the tenet of collegiality. the promulgation of this document and others caused a de-centralization of church recordkeeping practices. using the archdiocese of vancouver as a case study this paper will attempt to show recordkeeping changes that occurred after vatican i and vatican ii and the impact these councils had on archdiocesan administration.

and the census of canada, 1830&amp;#8211;2006 </title><content>census information of some form has been collected in canada since the 1611 census of new france. aboriginal people, identified or not, have been included in these enumerations. the collection of this information has had a profound impact on aboriginal people and has been an element that has shaped their relationship with the dominant society. in response, canadian aboriginal people have often resisted and refused to co-operate with census takers and their masters. this article is an examination of this phenomenon focused on the censuses conducted in the post-confederation period to the present. a census is made to collect information on populations and individuals that can then be used to configure and shape social and political relations between those being enumerated and the creators of the census. however, the human objects of the census are not just passive integers and they have resisted its creation in a number of ways, including being &amp;#8220;missing&amp;#8221; when the census is taken, refusing to answer the questions posed by enumerators or even driving them off aboriginal territory. a census identifies elements of the social order and attempts to set them in their &amp;#8220;proper&amp;#8221; place and those who do not wish to be part of that order may refuse to take part. archivists and historians must understand that the knowledge gained in a census is bound with the conditions of own creation. this has been noted by contemporary aboriginal researchers who often state that the archival record of their people often distorts history and reflects the ideas and superficial observations of their euro-canadian creators. changes to the census of canada since 1981, have increased the participation rate and therefore changed the nature of the record. </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Tom A  Adami  </authors><title>&amp;#8220;who will be left to tell the

</authors><title>evaluation, research and communities of practice: program evaluation in museums </title><content>museums present different contexts for learning, particularly when compared with places such as schools, universities and libraries. they have been described as free-choice learning environments visited by a broad range of people. museums have the opportunity to shape identities &amp;#8211; through access to objects, knowledge and information visitors see themselves and their culture reflected in ways that encourage new connections, meaning making and learning. however, across the world museums are finding themselves competing with other leisure and learning experiences in an increasingly global world. the long history of audience research in the cultural sector demonstrates the interest museums have had in their visitors over time. this paper outlines the development of audience research in museums, the context within which it operates, and describes the processes of audience research through a series of case studies drawn from the work of the australian museum audience research centre. it is argued that the shift in museums from mission-led program development to balancing content and audience needs through a transaction approach requires a broader research-focused agenda. while traditional ways of conducting evaluations are necessary and useful, to remain viable audience research needs to be more strategic, working across the sector in new ways and utilising new methods. how programs impact on users and facilitate learning about a wide range of key issues that museums are concerned with is a leadership role that audience research can take across both the cultural sector and other free-choice learning contexts. to achieve this, a communities of practice approach is suggested as a potential framework for audience research in the contemporary museum. </content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Christoph Graf

trust has demonstrated that there is currently little capacity or infrastructure in the developing world for managing government records as authentic evidence of policies, transactions, activities and entitlements. records management itself will not halt corruption and bring about accountability, but it is an essential contributor to public sector integrity. the records management capacity assessment system (rmcas) provides a means of assessing records management policies, procedures and resources against established international standards. it uses a diagnostic model, based on the records life cycle, to identify strengths, weaknesses and risk areas, and links with a database of training and capacity-building materials that can be used to plan improvements. designed initially to measure records and information systems in the financial management, human resource management and legal and judicial areas, it can also be applied generically. the rmcas software application will shortly be available, free of charge, through the internet or in cd-rom format. rmcas can be applied flexibly to take account of variations in size of institutions and the administrative contexts in which they operate, as well as developmental and national aspirations. it can be applied to both paper and digital records and assesses the relationship between paper and electronic systems.

middle of the 1990s. during this process the tasks, functions and competences of the agencies, which are to be appraised were analysed. the appraisal of the content itself is undertaken only when multiple archival processing has been eliminated by this method and the most significant records identified. actual tasks and functions of single administrative branches of different institutions (federal government, states, counties, and municipalities) are appraised, apart from already closed records. in this way, agencies creating archives and records today receive written decisions on the appraisal of records, which will be offered to the archives in future. archivists of different institutions are involved in this appraisal procedure. the experience gained here has continually developed the techniques of vertical and horizontal appraisal. this appraisal procedure is being further developed in a constant balance between theory and
