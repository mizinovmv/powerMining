</title><content>abstract. ;;we present a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve capacitated network design problems. given a capacitated network and point-to-point traffic demands, the objective is to install more capacity on the edges of the network and route traffic simultaneously, so that the overall cost is minimized. we study a mixed-integer programming formulation of the problem and identify some new facet defining inequalities. these inequalities, together with other known combinatorial and mixed-integer rounding inequalities, are used as cutting planes. to choose the branching variable, we use a new rule called &amp;#8220;knapsack branching&amp;#8221;. we also report on our computational experience using real-life data. </content></document><document><year>1999</year><authors>Robert

have been generalized to submodular flow problems (cf. references in fujishige [4]), e.g. the cycle canceling method of klein [9]. for network flow problems, the choice of minimum-mean cycles in goldberg and tarjan [6], and the choice of minimum-ratio cycles in wallacher [12] lead to polynomial cycle canceling methods. for submodular flow problems, cui and fujishige [1] show finiteness for

</title><content>;; well known extensions of the classical transportation problem are obtained by including fixed costs for the production of goods at the supply points (facility location) and/or by introducing stochastic demand, modeled by convex nonlinear costs, at the demand points (the stochastic transportation problem, [stp]). however, the simultaneous use of concave and convex costs is not very well treated in the literature. economies of scale often yield concave cost functions other than fixed charges, so in this paper we consider a problem with general concave costs at the supply points, as well as convex costs at the demand points. the objective function can then be represented as the difference of two convex functions, and is therefore called a d.c. function. we propose a solution method which reduces the problem to a d.c. optimization problem in a much smaller space, then solves the latter by a branch and bound procedure in which bounding is based on solving subproblems of the form of [stp]. we prove convergence of the method and report computational tests that indicate that quite large problems can be solved efficiently. problems up to the size of 100 supply points and 500 demand points are solved. </content></document><document><year>1999</year><authors>Christian Kanzow  | Hou-Duo Qi </authors><title>a qp-free constrained newton-type method for

cancer</authors><title>abstract.;;approximately 40% of all u.s. cancer cases are treated with radiation therapy. in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (imrt) the treatment planning problem is to choose external beam angles and their corresponding intensity maps (showing how the intensity varies across a given beam) to maximize tumor dose subject to the tolerances of surrounding healthy tissues. dose, like temperature, is a quantity defined at each point in the body, and the distribution of dose is determined by the choice of treatment parameters available to the planner. in addition to absolute dose limits in healthy tissues, some tissues have at least one dose-volume restriction that requires a fraction of its volume to not exceed a specified tighter threshold level for damage. there may also be a homogeneity limit for the tumor that restricts the allowed spread of dose across its volume. we formulate this planning problem as a mixed integer program over a coupled pair of column generation processes -- one designed to produce intensity maps, and a second specifying protected area choices for tissues under dose-volume restrictions. the combined procedure is shown to strike a balance between computing an approximately optimal solution and bounding its maximum possible suboptimality that we believe holds promise for implementations able to offer the power and flexibility of mixed-integer linear programming models on instances of practical scale.</title><content/></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Thomas C  Sharkey  | H  Edwin Romeijn   | Joseph

based on the properties of a closely related class of linear programs. using these properties, we provide a solution method that runs in polynomial time in the number of decision variables, while also depending on the time required to solve a particular one-dimensional optimization problem. thus, for the many applications in which this one-dimensional function is reasonably well behaved (e.g., unimodal), the resulting algorithm runs in polynomial time. we next develop a related solution approach to a class of continuous, nonlinear, and nonseparable multiple-choice knapsack problems. this algorithm runs in polynomial time in both the number of variables and the number of variants per item, while again dependent on the complexity of the same one-dimensional optimization problem as for the knapsack problem. computational testing demonstrates the power of the proposed algorithms over a commercial global optimization software package.

(robust portfolio management. manuscript, department of industrial engineering and operations research, columbia university, new york, 2004), goldfarb and iyengar (math oper res 28:1&amp;#8211;38, 2003), tгјtгјncгј and koenig (ann oper res 132:157&amp;#8211;187, 2004)]. for these uncertainty sets, each type of uncertain parameters (e.g., mean and covariance) has its own uncertainty set. as addressed in lu (a new cone programming approach for robust portfolio selection, technical report, department of mathematics, simon fraser university, burnaby, 2006; robust portfolio selection based on a joint ellipsoidal uncertainty set, manuscript, department of mathematics, simon fraser university, burnaby, 2008), these &amp;#8220;separable&amp;#8221; uncertainty sets typically share two common properties: (i) their actual confidence level, namely, the probability of uncertain parameters falling within the uncertainty set is unknown, and it can be much higher than the desired one; and (ii) they are fully or partially box-type. the associated consequences are that the resulting robust portfolios can be too conservative, and moreover, they are usually highly non-diversified as observed in the computational experiments conducted in this paper and tгјtгјncгј and koenig (ann oper res 132:157&amp;#8211;187, 2004). to combat these drawbacks, the author of this paper introduced a &amp;#8220;joint&amp;#8221; ellipsoidal uncertainty set (lu in a new cone programming approach for robust portfolio selection, technical report, department of mathematics, simon fraser university, burnaby, 2006; robust portfolio selection based on a joint ellipsoidal uncertainty set, manuscript, department of mathematics, simon fraser university, burnaby, 2008) and showed that it can be constructed as a confidence region associated with a statistical procedure applied to estimate the model parameters. for this uncertainty set, we showed in lu (a new cone programming approach for robust portfolio selection, technical report, department of mathematics, simon fraser university, burnaby, 2006; robust portfolio selection based on a joint ellipsoidal uncertainty set, manuscript, department of mathematics, simon fraser university, burnaby, 2008) that the corresponding robust maximum risk-adjusted return (rmrar) model can be reformulated and solved as a cone programming problem. in this paper, we conduct computational experiments to compare the performance of the robust portfolios determined by the rmrar models with our &amp;#8220;joint&amp;#8221;

optimization problems, i.e. problems with a large number of variables and a huge number of local optima, heuristic procedures are the only possible choice. in this situation, lacking any possibility of guaranteeing global optimality for most problem instances, it is quite difficult to establish rules for discriminating among different algorithms. we think that in order to judge the quality of new global optimization methods, different criteria might be adopted like, e.g.: 1.; efficiency &amp;#8211; measured in terms of the computational effort necessary to obtain the putative global optimum 2.; robustness &amp;#8211; measured in terms of &amp;#8220;percentage of successes&amp;#8221;, i.e. of the number of times the algorithm, re-started with different seeds or starting points, is able to end up at the putative global optimum 3.; discovery capability &amp;#8211; measured in terms of the possibility that an algorithm discovers, for the first time, a putative optimum for a given problem which is better than the best known up to now. of course the third criterion cannot be considered as a compulsory one, as it might be the case that, for a given problem, the best known putative global optimum is indeed the global one, so that no algorithm will ever be able to discover a better one. in this paper we present a computational framework based on a population-based stochastic method in which different candidate solutions for a single problem are maintained in a population which evolves in such a way as to guarantee a sufficient diversity among solutions. this diversity enforcement is obtained through the definition of a dissimilarity measure whose definition is dependent on the specific problem class. we show in the paper that, for some well known and particularly hard test classes, the proposed method satisfies the above criteria, in that it is both much more efficient and robust when compared with other published approaches. moreover, for the very hard problem of determining the minimum energy conformation of a cluster of particles which interact through short-range morse potential, our approach was able to discover four new putative optima.

decomposable mixed integer programming problems, it is standard to formulate and solve the master problem as a linear program. seen in the dual space, this results in the algorithm known in the nonlinear programming community as the cutting-plane algorithm of kelley and cheney-goldstein. however, more stable methods with better theoretical convergence rates are known and have been used as alternatives to this standard. one of them is the bundle method; our aim is to illustrate its differences with kelley&amp;#8217;s method. in the process we review alternative stabilization techniques used in column generation, comparing them from both primal and dual points of view. numerical comparisons are presented for five applications: cutting stock (which includes bin packing), vertex coloring, capacitated vehicle routing, multi-item lot sizing, and traveling salesman. we also give a sketchy comparison with the volume algorithm.

</title><content>abstract;;we study a multi-period oligopolistic market for a single perishable product with fixed inventory. our goal is to address the competitive aspect of the problem together with demand uncertainty using ideas from robust optimization and variational inequalities. the demand function for each seller has some associated uncertainty and we assume that the sellers would like to adopt a policy that is robust to adverse uncertain circumstances. we believe this is the first paper that uses robust optimization for dynamic pricing under competition. in particular, starting with a given fixed inventory, each seller competes over a multi-period time horizon in the market by setting prices and protection levels for each period at the beginning of the time horizon. any unsold inventory at the end of the horizon is worthless. the sellers do not have the option of periodically reviewing and replenishing their inventory. we study non-cooperative nash equilibrium policies for sellers under such a model. this kind of a setup can be used to model pricing of air fares, hotel reservations, bandwidth in communication networks, etc. in this paper we demonstrate our results through some numerical examples. </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Pasquale Avella  | Antonio Sassano   | Igor Vasil'ev |   </authors><title>computational study of large-scale

</title><content>abstract;;this paper deals with two-stage and multi-stage stochastic programs in which the right-hand sides of the constraints are gaussian random variables. such problems are of

solving nonlinear optimization problems. we consider a standard interior point approach, for which the complementarity conditions of the original primal-dual system are perturbed by a parameter driven to zero during the iterations. the sequence of iterates is generated by a linearization of the perturbed system and by applying the fraction to the boundary rule to maintain strict feasibility of the iterates with respect to the nonnegativity constraints. the analysis of the rate of convergence is carried out by considering an arbitrary sequence of perturbation parameters converging to zero. we first show that, once an iterate belongs to a neighbourhood of convergence of the newton method applied to the original system, then the whole sequence of iterates converges to the solution. in addition, if the perturbation parameters converge to zero with a rate of convergence at most superlinear, then the sequence of iterates becomes asymptotically tangent to the central trajectory in a natural way. we give an example showing that this property can be false when the perturbation parameter goes to zero quadratically. </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Michael J

applications, including single-and multi-facility location problems. the functionf is, in general, not differentiable atx if at least oner i (x) is zero. computational methods described in the literature converge quite slowly if the solution is at such a point. we present a new method which, at each iteration, computes a direction of search by solving the newton system of equations, projected, if necessary, into a linear manifold along whichf is locally differentiable. a special line search is used to obtain the next iterate. the algorithm is closely related to a method recently described by calamai and conn. the new method has quadratic convergence to a solutionx under given conditions. the reason for this property depends on the nature of the solution. if none of the residuals is zero at* x, thenf is differentiable at* x and the quadratic convergence follows from standard properties of newton's method. if one of the residuals, sayr i * x), is zero, then, as the iteration proceeds, the hessian off becomes extremely ill-conditioned. it is proved that this illconditioning, instead of creating difficulties, actually causes quadratic convergence to the manifold (x&amp;#8475;r i (x)=0}. if this is a single point, the solution is thus identified. otherwise it is necessary to continue the iteration restricted to this manifold, where the usual quadratic convergence for newton's method applies. if several residuals are zero at* x, several stages of quadratic convergence take place as the correct index set is constructed. thus the ill-conditioning property accelerates the identification of the residuals which are zero at the solution. numerical experiments are presented, illustrating these results.

the total size of items which may migrate between bins must be bounded by a constant factor times the size of the new item. we show that such a property cannot be maintained with respect to optimal solutions. </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Franz Rendl   | Henry Wolkowicz  </authors><title>a semidefinite framework for trust region subproblems with applications to large scale minimization </title><content>abstract;;primal-dual pairs of semidefinite programs provide a general framework for the theory and algorithms for the trust region subproblem (trs). this latter problem consists in minimizing a general quadratic function subject to a convex quadratic constraint and, therefore, it is a generalization of the minimum eigenvalue problem. the importance of (trs) is due to the fact that it provides the step in trust region minimization algorithms. the semidefinite framework is studied as an interesting instance of semidefinite programming as well as a tool for viewing known algorithms and deriving new algorithms for (trs). in particular, a dual simplex type method is studied that solves (trs) as a parametric eigenvalue problem. this method uses the lanczos algorithm for the smallest eigenvalue as a black box. therefore, the essential cost of the algorithm is the matrix-vector multiplication and, thus, sparsity can be exploited. a primal simplex type method provides steps for the so-called hard case. extensive numerical tests for large sparse problems are discussed. these tests show that the cost of the algorithm is 1 +&amp;#945;(n) times the cost of finding a minimum eigenvalue using the lanczos algorithm, where 0&amp;lt;&amp;#945;(n)&amp;lt;1 is a fraction which decreases as the dimension increases.

(a generalization of the minimum-mean cycle selection rule in cycle canceling algorithms, 1991) to find gaps that have a good trade-off between the gain of the gap and the residual capacity of its arcs; our algorithm may be viewed as a special case of wayne&amp;#8217;s algorithm for the generalized minimum-cost circulation problem (wayne in math oper res 27:445&amp;#8211;459, 2002). most previous algorithms for the generalized maximum flow problem are dual-based; the few previous primal algorithms (including wayne in math oper res 27:445&amp;#8211;459, 2002) require subroutines to

</title><content>abstract;;we focus on the numerical solution of closed-loop stochastic problems, and propose a perturbed gradient algorithm to achieve this goal. the main hurdle in such problems is the fact that the control variables are infinite-dimensional, due to, e.g., the information constraints. alternatively said, control variables are feedbacks, i.e., functions. such controls have hence to be represented in a finite way in order to solve the problem numerically. in the same way, the gradient of the criterion is itself an infinite-dimensional object. our algorithm replaces this exact (and unknown) gradient by a perturbed one, which consists of the product of the true gradient evaluated at a random point and a kernel function which extends this gradient to the neighbourhood of the random point. proceeding this way, we explore the whole space iteration after iteration through random points. since each kernel function is perfectly known by a small number of parameters, say n, the control at iteration k is perfectly known as an infinite-dimensional object by at most n;г—;k parameters. the main strength of this method is that it avoids any discretization of the underlying space, provided that we can sample as many points as needed in this space. moreover, our algorithm can take into account the possible measurability constraints of the problem in a new way. finally, the randomized strategy implemented by the algorithm causes the most probable parts of the space to be the most explored ones, which is a priori an interesting feature. in this paper, we first prove two convergence results of this algorithm in the strongly convex and convex cases, and then give some numerical examples showing the interest of this method for practical stochastic optimization problems.

the set partitioning formulation with additional cuts that correspond to capacity and clique inequalities. the exact algorithm uses a bounding procedure that finds a near optimal dual solution of the

the cvrp. the second one combines lagrangean relaxation, pricing and cut generation. the third attempts to close the duality gap left by the first two procedures using a classical pricing and cut generation technique. the final dual solution is used to generate a reduced problem containing only the routes whose reduced costs are smaller than the gap between an upper bound and the lower bound achieved. the resulting problem is solved by an integer programming solver. computational results over the main instances from the literature show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

</title><content>abstract;;in this paper, an exact dual is derived for semidefinite programming (sdp), for which strong duality properties hold without any regularity assumptions. its main features are: (i) the new dual is an explicit semidefinite program with polynomially many variables and polynomial size coefficient bitlengths. (ii) if the primal is feasible, then it is bounded if and only if the dual is feasible. (iii) when the primal is feasible and bounded, then its optimum value equals that of the dual, or in other words, there is no duality gap. further, the dual attains this common optimum value. (iv) it yields a precise theorem of the alternative for semidefinite inequality systems, i.e. a characterization of theinfeasibility of a semidefinite inequality in terms of thefeasibility of another polynomial size semidefinite inequality. the standard duality for linear programming satisfies all of the above features, but no such explicit gap-free dual program of polynomial size was previously known for sdp, without slater-like conditions being assumed. the dual is then applied to derive certain complexity results for sdp. the decision problem of semidefinite feasibility (sdfp), which asks to determine if a given semidefinite inequality system is feasible, is the central problem of interest, he complexity of sdfp is unknown, but we show the following: (i) in the turing machine model, the membership or nonmembership of sdfp in np and co-np is simultaneous; hence sdfp is not np-complete unless np=co-np.

landmark result of fekete and schepers suggests to put these geometric aspects aside and use the most advanced tools for the one-dimensional case. in this paper we make additional progress in this direction, especially on the basic question &amp;#8220;does a given set of rectangles fit into a square?&amp;#8221;, which turns out to be the bottleneck of all the approaches known. given a set of rectangles and the associated convex hull of rectangle subsets that fit into a square, we derive a wide class of valid inequalities for this convex hull from a complete description of the two knapsack polytopes associated with the widths and the heights of the rectangles, respectively. in addition, we illustrate how to solve the associated separation problem as a bilinear program, for which we develop a solution method that turns out to be fast in practice, and show that the integer solutions that satisfy all these constraints generally correspond to vertices of the original convex hull for the benchmark instances in the literature. the same tools are used to derive lower bounds for the two-dimensional bin packing problem, corresponding to the determination of an optimal pair of so-called dual feasible functions. these lower bounds in many cases equal those obtained by the customary set covering formulation (for which column generation is very hard), but are computable within

structure, which is reflected by many characterizations with respect to different concepts. perfect graphs are, for instance, precisely those graphs g where the stable set polytope stab(g) equals the fractional stable set polytope qstab(g). the dilation ratio of the two polytopes yields the imperfection ratio of g. it is np-hard to compute and, for most graph classes, it is even unknown whether it is bounded. for graphs g such that all facets of stab(g) are rank constraints associated with antiwebs, we characterize the imperfection ratio and bound it by 3/2. outgoing from this result, we characterize and bound the imperfection ratio for several graph classes, including near-bipartite graphs and their complements, namely quasi-line graphs, by means of induced antiwebs and webs,

introduction of a superclass of circulant graphs that are called clique-circulants. the new class of graphs is invetigated in depth. we characterize which clique-circulants c are facet producing, i.e. are such that is a facet of stab(c), thus extending a result of trotter (discrete math. 12:373&amp;#8211;388, 1975) for circulants. we show that a simple clique family inequality (oriolo, discrete

with degeneracy in reduced gradient algorithms </title><content>abstract;;many algorithms for linearly constrained optimization problems proceed by solving a sequence of subproblems. in these subproblems, the number of variables is implicitly reduced by using the linear constraints to express certain &amp;#8216;basic&amp;#8217; variables in terms of other variables. difficulties may arise, however, if degeneracy is present; that is, if one or more basic variables are at lower or upper bounds. in this situation, arbitrarily small movements along a feasible search direction in the reduced problem may result in infeasibilities for basic variables in the original problem. for such cases, the search direction is typically discarded, a new reduced problem is formed and a new search direction is computed. such a process may be extremely costly, particularly in large-scale optimization where degeneracy is likely and good search directions can be expensive to compute. this paper is concerned with a practical method for ensuring that directions that are computed in the reduced space are actually feasible in the original problem. it is based on a generalization of the &amp;#8216;maximal basis&amp;#8217; result first introduced by dembo and klincewicz for large nonlinear network optimization problems. </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Andrzej

studies the class of differential variational inequalities (dvis) in a finite-dimensional euclidean space. the dvi provides a powerful modeling paradigm for many applied problems in which dynamics, inequalities, and discontinuities are present; examples of such problems include constrained time-dependent physical systems with unilateral constraints, differential nash games, and hybrid engineering systems with variable structures. the dvi unifies several mathematical problem classes that include ordinary differential equations (odes) with smooth and discontinuous right-hand sides, differential algebraic equations (daes), dynamic complementarity systems, and evolutionary variational inequalities. conditions are presented under which the dvi can be converted, either locally or globally, to an equivalent ode with a lipschitz continuous right-hand function. for dvis that cannot be so converted, we consider their numerical resolution via an euler time-stepping procedure, which involves the solution of a sequence of finite-dimensional variational inequalities. borrowing results from differential inclusions (dis) with upper semicontinuous, closed and convex valued multifunctions, we establish the convergence of such a procedure for solving initial-value dvis. we also present a class of dvis for which the theory of dis is not directly applicable, and yet similar convergence can be established. finally, we extend the method to a boundary-value dvi and provide conditions for the convergence of the method. the results in this paper pertain exclusively to systems with &amp;#8220;index&amp;#8221; not exceeding two and which have absolutely continuous solutions. </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Sebastian Sager  | Hans Georg Bock   |

achieved in the solution of optimization problems involving integer variables, in particular mixed-integer linear programs, as well as in continuous optimal control problems, the combination of the two is yet an open field of research. we consider the question of lower bounds that can be obtained by a relaxation of the integer requirements. for general nonlinear mixed-integer programs such lower bounds typically suffer from a huge integer gap. we convexify (with respect to binary controls) and relax the original problem and prove that the optimal solution of this continuous control problem yields the best lower bound for the nonlinear integer problem. building on this theoretical result we present a novel algorithm to solve mixed-integer optimal control problems, with a focus on discrete-valued control functions. our algorithm is based on the direct multiple shooting method, an adaptive refinement of the underlying control discretization grid and tailored heuristic integer methods. its applicability is shown by a challenging application, the energy optimal control of a subway train with discrete gears and velocity limits.

necessary. usually, the rail system is periodically scheduled. a fundamental base of the schedule are the lines connecting several stations with a fixed frequency. possible objectives for the construction of the line plan may be the minimization of the total cost or the maximization of the passengers&amp;#8217;s comfort satisfying certain regulations. after the lines of the system are fixed, the train schedule can be determined. a criterion for the quality of a schedule is the total transit time of the passengers including the waiting time which should be minimized satisfying some operational constraints. for each trip of the schedule a train consisting of a locomotive and some carriages is needed for service. the assignment of rolling stock to schedule trips has to satisfy operational requirements. a comprehensible objective is to minimize the total cost. after all strategic and tactical planning the schedule has to be realized. several external influences, for example delayed trains, force the dispatcher to recompute parts of the schedule on-line. </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Dimitri P  Bertsekas </authors><title>distributed asynchronous

feedback control policy, given the current state, is non-convex. a recent breakthrough has been the application of robust optimization techniques to reparameterize this problem as a convex program. while the reparameterized problem is theoretically tractable, the number of variables is quadratic in the number of stages or horizon length n and has no apparent exploitable structure, leading to computational time of per iteration of an interior-point method. we focus on the case when the disturbance set is &amp;#8734;-norm bounded or the linear map of a hypercube, and the cost function involves the minimization of a quadratic cost. here we make use of state variables to regain a sparse problem structure that is related to the structure of the original problem, that is, the policy optimization problem may be decomposed into a set of coupled finite horizon control problems. this decomposition can then be formulated as a highly structured quadratic program, solvable by primal-dual interior-point methods in which each iteration requires time. this cubic iteration time can be guaranteed using a riccati-based block factorization technique, which is standard in discrete-time optimal control. numerical results are presented, using a standard sparse primal-dual interior point solver, that illustrate the efficiency of this approach.

point methods and robust optimization. these advances have recently started to significantly impact various fields of applied sciences and engineering where computational efficiency is essential. this paper focuses on two such fields: digital signal processing and communication. in the past, the widely used optimization methods in both fields had been the gradient descent or least squares methods, both of which are known to suffer from the usual headaches of stepsize selection, algorithm initialization and local minima. with the recent advances in conic and robust optimization, the opportunity is ripe to use the newly developed interior point optimization techniques and highly efficient software tools to help advance the fields of signal processing and digital communication. this paper surveys recent successes of applying interior point and robust optimization to solve some core problems in these two fields. the successful applications considered in this paper include adaptive filtering, robust beamforming, design and analysis of multi-user communication system, channel equalization, decoding and detection. throughout, our emphasis is on how to exploit the hidden convexity, convex reformulation of semi-infinite constraints, analysis of convergence, complexity and performance, as well as efficient practical implementation.

algorithm, which involves an inner iteration in which the perturbed systems are approximately solved, is outlined. it is shown that asymptotically, a single linear system is solved per update of the scalar parameter. it turns out that a componentwise q-superlinear rate may be attained, both in the direct error and in the residuals, under standard assumptions, and that this rate may be made arbitrarily close to quadratic. numerical experiments illustrate the results and we discuss the relationships that this method shares with interior methods in constrained optimization.

paper necessary, and sufficient optimality conditions are established without lipschitz continuity for convex composite continuous optimization model problems subject to inequality constraints. necessary conditions for the special case of the optimization model involving max-min constraints, which frequently arise in many engineering applications, are also given. optimality conditions in the presence of lipschitz continuity are routinely obtained using chain rule formulas of the clarke generalized jacobian which is a bounded set of matrices. however, the lack of derivative of a continuous map in the absence of lipschitz continuity is often replaced by a locally unbounded generalized jacobian map for which the standard form of the chain rule formulas fails to hold. in this paper we overcome this situation by constructing approximate jacobians for the convex composite function involved in the model problem using &amp;#949;-perturbations of the subdifferential of the convex function and the flexible generalized calculus of unbounded approximate jacobians. examples are discussed to illustrate the nature of the optimality conditions.

application of conjugate duality leads to the arbitrage pricing theorems of financial mathematics, namely the equivalence of absence of arbitrage and the existence of a probability measure that makes the price process into a martingale. the model easily extends to the analysis of options pricing when modeling risk management concerns and the impact of spreads and margin requirements for writers of contingent claims. however, we find that arbitrage pricing in incomplete markets fails to model incentives to buy or sell options. an extension of the model to incorporate pre-existing liabilities and

algorithm performs a small number of matrix-vector and vector-vector multiplications (that take full advantage of the sparsity of the original data) plus a small number of other operations involving the cone c x . the algorithm is &amp;#8220;elementary&amp;#8221; in the sense that it performs only a few relatively simple computations at each iteration.в¶the solution of the system (fp d ) generated by the algorithm has the property of being &amp;#8220;reliable&amp;#8221; in the sense that the distance from to the boundary of the cone c x , dist(,&amp;#8706;c x ), and the size of the

</authors><title>discretization and localization in successive convex relaxation methods for nonconvex quadratic optimization </title><content>abstract. ;;based on the authors&amp;#8217; previous work which established theoretical foundations of two, conceptual, successive convex relaxation methods, i.e., the ssdp (successive semidefinite programming) relaxation method and the ssilp (successive semi-infinite linear programming) relaxation method, this paper proposes their implementable variants for general quadratic optimization problems. these problems have a linear objective function c t x to be maximized over a nonconvex compact feasible region f described by a finite number of quadratic inequalities. we introduce two new techniques, &amp;#8220;discretization&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;localization,&amp;#8221; into the ssdp and ssilp relaxation methods. the discretization technique makes it possible to approximate an infinite number of semi-infinite sdps (or semi-infinite lps) which appeared at each iteration of the original methods by a finite number of standard sdps (or standard lps) with a finite number of linear inequality constraints. we establish:в¶&amp;#8226;given any open convex set u containing f, there is an implementable discretization of the ssdp (or ssilp) relaxation method which generates a compact convex set c such that f&amp;#8838;c&amp;#8838;u in a finite number of iterations.в¶the localization technique is for the cases where we are only interested in upper bounds on the optimal objective value (for a fixed objective function vector c) but not in a global approximation of the convex hull of f. this technique allows us to generate a convex relaxation of f that is accurate only in certain directions in a neighborhood of the objective direction c. this cuts off redundant work to make the convex relaxation accurate in unnecessary directions. we establish:в¶&amp;#8226;given any positive number &amp;#949;, there is an implementable localization-discretization of the ssdp (or ssilp) relaxation method which generates an upper bound of the objective value within &amp;#949; of its maximum in a finite number of iterations. </content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Paolo Nobili  | Antonio Sassano </authors><title>(0, &amp;plusmn;1) ideal matrices</title><content>abstract;;a (0, 1) matrixa is said to be ideal if all the vertices of the polytopeq(a) = {x ax 1, 0 x 1} are integral. the issue of finding a satisfactory characterization of those matrices which are minimally non-ideal is a well known open problem. an outstanding result toward the solution of this problem, due to alfred lehman, is the description of crucial properties of minimally non-ideal matrices. in this paper we consider the extension of the notion of ideality to (0, &amp;plusmn;1) matrices. by means of a standard transformation, we associate with any (0, &amp;plusmn;1) matrixa a suitable (0, 1) matrixd(a). then we introduce the concept of disjoint completiona+ of a (0, &amp;plusmn;1) matrixa and we show thata is ideal if and only ifd(a+) is ideal. moreover, we introduce a suitable concept of a minimally non-ideal (0, &amp;plusmn;1) matrix and we prove a lehman-type characterization of minimally non-ideal (0, &amp;plusmn;1) matrices. &amp;copy; 1998 the mathematical programming society,

convergent algorithm for nonlinear programs, complementarity and variational inequality problems</title><content>abstract;;this paper presents a globally convergent, locally quadratically convergent algorithm for solving general nonlinear programs, nonlinear complementarity and variational inequality problems. the algorithm is based on a unified formulation of these three mathematical programming problems as a certain system of b-differentiable equations, and is a modification of the damped newton method described in pang (1990) for solving such systems of nonsmooth equations. the algorithm resembles several existing methods for solving these classes of mathematical programs, but has some special features of its own; in particular, it possesses the combined advantage of fast quadratic rate of convergence of a basic newton method and the desirable global convergence induced by one-dimensional armijo line searches. in the context of a nonlinear program, the algorithm is of the sequential quadratic programming type with two distinct characteristics: (i) it makes no use of a penalty function; and (ii) it circumvents the maratos effect. in the context of the variational inequality/complementarity problem, the algorithm provides a newton-type descent method that is guaranteed globally convergent without requiring the f-differentiability assumption of the defining b-differentiable equations.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Norman Zadeh </authors><title>a bad network problem for the simplex method and other minimum cost flow

curves of critical points and the persistence of minima along these curves. changes in the structure of the solution occur at singularities of a nonlinear system of equations motivated by the fritz john first-order necessary conditions. it has been shown that these singularities may be completely partitioned into seven distinct classes based upon the violation of one or more of the following: a complementarity condition, a constraint qualification, and the nonsingularity of the hessian of the lagrangian on a tangent space. to apply classical bifurcation techniques to these singularities, a further subdivision of each case is necessary. the structure of curves of critical points near singularities of lowest (zero) codimension within each case is analyzed, as well as the persistence of minima along curves emanating from these singularities. bifurcation behavior is also investigated or discussed for many of the subcases giving rise to a codimension one

branch-and-cut approach for solving the multiple sequence alignment problem, which is a central problem in computational biology. we propose a general model for this problem in which arbitrary gap costs are allowed. an interesting aspect of our approach is that the three (exponentially large) classes of natural valid inequalities that we consider turn out to be both facet-defining for the convex hull of integer solutions and separable in polynomial time. both the proofs that these classes of valid inequalities are facet-defining and the description of the separation algorithms are far from trivial. experimental results on several benchmark instances show that our method outperforms the best tools developed so far, in that it produces alignments that are better from a biological point of view. a noteworthy outcome of the results is the effectiveness of using branch-and-cut with only a carefully-selected subset of the variables as a heuristic.
