In [11], related techniques were used to develop a boundary condition capturing approach for the variable coefficient Poisson equation on domains with an embedded interface. In this paper, these new numerical techniques are extended to treat multiphase incompressible flow including the effects of viscosity, surface tension and gravity. While the most notable finite difference techniques for multiphase incompressible flow involve numerical smearing of the equations near the interface, see, e.g., [19,;17,;1], this new approach treats the interface in a sharp fashion.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Glenn R.

Speziale1</authors><title>A Combined Large-Eddy Simulation and Time-Dependent RANS Capability for High-Speed Compressible Flows</title><content>An entirely new approach to the large-eddy simulation (LES) of high-speed compressible turbulent flows is presented. Subgrid scale stress models are proposed that are dimensionless functions of the computational mesh size times a Reynolds stress model. This allows a DNS to go continuously to an LES and then a Reynolds-averaged Navier&amp;#x2013;Stokes (RANS) computation as the mesh becomes successively more coarse or the Reynolds number becomes much larger. Here, the level of discretization is parameterized by the nondimensional ratio of the computational mesh size to the Kolmogorov length scale. The Reynolds stress model is based on a state-of-the-art two-equation model whose enhanced performance is documented in detail in a variety of benchmark flows. It contains many of the most recent advances in compressible turbulence modeling. Applications to the high-speed aerodynamic flows of technological importance are briefly discussed.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Ming Li1 | Tao Tang2 </authors><title>A Compact Fourth-Order Finite Difference Scheme for Unsteady Viscous Incompressible Flows</title><content>In this paper, we extend a previous work on a compact scheme for the steady Navier&amp;#x2013;Stokes equations [Li, Tang, and Fornberg (1995), Int. J. Numer. Methods Fluids, 20, 1137&amp;#x2013;1151] to the unsteady case. By exploiting the coupling relation between the streamfunction and vorticity equations, the Navier&amp;#x2013;Stokes equations are discretized in space within a 3&amp;times;3 stencil such that a fourth order accuracy is achieved. The time derivatives are discretized in such a way as to maintain the compactness of the stencil. We explore several known time-stepping approaches including second-order BDF method, fourth-order BDF method and the Crank&amp;#x2013;Nicolson method. Numerical solutions are obtained for the driven cavity problem and are compared with solutions available in the literature. For large values of the Reynolds number, it is found that high-order time discretizations outperform the low-order ones.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Arnim Br&amp;uuml ger1 | Jonas Nilsson2 | Wendy Kress2</authors><title>A Compact Higher Order Finite Difference Method for the Incompressible Navier&amp;#x2013;Stokes Equations</title><content>A numerical method based on compact fourth order finite difference approximations is used for the solution of the incompressible Navier&amp;#x2013;Stokes equations.

A single step, low order Euler time integration method is compared with Adams&amp;#x2013;Bashforth, a second order accurate time integration strategy for the solution of one dimensional wave equation. With the help of the exact solution, it is shown that the presence of the computational mode in Adams&amp;#x2013;Bashforth scheme leads to erroneous results, if the solution contains high frequency components. This is tested for the solution of incompressible Navier&amp;#x2013;Stokes equation for uniform flow past a rapidly rotating circular cylinder. This flow suffers intermittent temporal instabilities implying presence of high frequencies. Such instabilities have been noted earlier in experiments and high accuracy computations for similar flow parameters. This test problem shows that second order Adams&amp;#x2013; Bashforth time integration is not suitable for DNS.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Mark Sussman1  | M. Y.

Jauberteau1</authors><title>A Dynamic Multilevel Model for the Simulation of the Small Structures in Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence</title><content>In turbulence simulations, the small scales of motion, even if they carry only a very small percentage of the whole kinetic energy, must be taken into account in order to accurately reproduce the statistical properties of the flows. This induces strong computational restrictions. In an attempt to understand and model the nonlinear interaction between the small and large scales, a dynamic multilevel procedure is proposed and applied to homogeneous turbulence. As in large eddy simulation, filtering operators are used to separate the different scales of the velocity field. In classical models (Smagorinsky), only the large scale equation is resolved. A different approach is proposed here. Indeed, by analyzing the nonlinear interaction term in the large scale equation, we show that they locally have a very small contribution to the whole dynamic of the flow. We then propose to treat them less accurately. Specific treatments for these terms are achieved by a space and time adaptative procedure; the cut-off value (filter width) which defines the scale separation varies as time evolves. Simulations at Re in the range of 60 to 150 have been performed until statistical steady states are reached, i.e. over long time period. Comparisons with direct simulations (DNS) show that this numerical modeling provides an efficient resolution of the nonlinear interaction term. The multilevel algorithm is shown to be stable; the corresponding simulated flows reach a statistically steady state very close to the DNS ones. The shape of the energy spectrum functions as well as the characteristic statistical properties of the velocity and its derivatives are accurately recovered.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Bertil Gustafsson | Lina Hemmingsson-Fr&amp;auml nd&amp;eacute n1</authors><title>A Fast Domain Decomposition High Order Poisson Solver</title><content>We present a fast high-order Poisson solver for implementation on parallel computers. The method uses deferred correction, such that high-order accuracy is obtained by solving a sequence of systems with a narrow stencil on the left-hand side. These systems are solved by a domain decomposition method. The method is direct in the sense that for any given order of accuracy, the number of arithmetic operations is fixed. Numerical experiments show that these high-order solvers easily outperform standard second-order ones. The very fast algorithm in combination with the coarser grid allowed for by the high-order method, also makes it quite possible to compete with adaptive methods and irregular grids for problems with solutions containing widely different scales.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Elena Braverman1 | Boris Epstein2| Moshe Israeli3 | Amir Averbuch4</authors><title>A Fast Spectral Subtractional Solver for Elliptic Equations</title><content>The paper presents a fast subtractional spectral algorithm for the solution of the Poisson equation and the Helmholtz equation which does not require an extension of the original domain. It takes O(N2 log N) operations, where N is the number of collocation points in each direction. The method is based on the eigenfunction expansion of the right hand side with integration and the successive solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation using Modified Fourier Method. Both the right hand side and the boundary conditions are not assumed to have any periodicity properties. This algorithm is used as a preconditioner for the iterative solution of elliptic equations with non-constant coefficients. The procedure enjoys the following properties: fast convergence and high accuracy even when the computation employs a small number of collocation points. We also apply the basic solver to the solution of the Poisson equation in complex geometries.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Bertr| Maury1 </authors><title>A Fat Boundary Method for the Poisson Problem in a Domain with Holes</title><content>We consider the Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, in a domain \, where  n, and B is a collection of smooth open subsets (typically balls). The objective is to split the initial problem into two parts: a problem set in the whole domain , for which fast solvers can be used, and local subproblems set in narrow domains around the connected components of B, which can be solved in a fully parallel way. We shall present here a method based on a multi-domain formulation of the initial problem, which leads to a fixed point algorithm. The convergence of the algorithm is established, under some conditions on a relaxation parameter . The dependence of the convergence interval for  upon the geometry is investigated.

The method is especially suitable for moderate to large Reynolds number flows. The momentum equation is discretized by a compact fourth order scheme with the no-slip boundary condition enforced using a local vorticity boundary condition. Fourth order long-stencil discretizations are used for the temperature transport equation with one-sided extrapolation applied near the boundary. The time stepping scheme for both equations is classical fourth order Runge&amp;#x2013;Kutta. The method is highly efficient. The main computation consists of the solution of two Poisson-like equations at each Runge&amp;#x2013;Kutta time stage for which standard FFT based fast Poisson solvers are used. An example of Lorenz flow is presented, in which the full fourth order accuracy is checked. The numerical simulation of a strong shear flow induced by a temperature jump, is resolved by two perfectly matching resolutions. Additionally, we present benchmark quality simulations of a differentially-heated cavity problem. This flow was the focus of a special session at the first MIT conference on Computational Fluid and Solid Mechanics in June 2001.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>L.

The solution domain is divided into mostly parallelepiped subdomains. In each subdomain a particular solution of the non-homogeneous equation is first computed by a fast spectral method. This method is based on the application of the discrete Fourier transform accompanied by a subtraction technique. For high accuracy the subdomain boundary conditions must be compatible with the specified inhomogeneous right hand side at the edges of all the interfaces. In the following steps the partial solutions are hierarchically matched. At each step pairs of adjacent subdomains are merged into larger units. In this paper we present the matching algorithm for two boxes which is a basis of the domain decomposition scheme. The hierarchical approach is convenient for parallelization and minimizes the global communication. The algorithm requires O(N3:log:N) operations, where N is the number of grid points in each direction.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Anne Gelb1 </authors><title>A Hybrid Approach to Spectral Reconstruction of Piecewise Smooth Functions</title><content>Consider a piecewise smooth function for which the (pseudo-)spectral coefficients are given. It is well known that while spectral partial sums yield exponentially convergent approximations for smooth functions, the results for piecewise smooth functions are poor, with spurious oscillations developing near the discontinuities and a much reduced overall convergence rate. This behavior, known as the Gibbs phenomenon, is considered as one of the major drawbacks in the application of spectral methods. Various types of reconstruction methods developed for the recovery of piecewise smooth functions have met with varying degrees of success. The Gegenbauer reconstruction method, originally proposed by Gottlieb et al. has the particularly impressive ability to reconstruct piecewise analytic functions with exponential convergence up to the points of discontinuity. However, it has been sharply criticized for its high cost and susceptibility to round-off error. In this paper, a new approach to Gegenbauer reconstruction is considered, resulting in a reconstruction method that is less computationally intensive and costly, yet still enjoys superior convergence. The idea is to create a procedure that combines the well known exponential filtering method in smooth regions away from the discontinuities with the Gegenbauer reconstruction method in regions close to the discontinuities. This hybrid approach benefits from both the simplicity of exponential filtering and the high resolution properties of the Gegenbauer reconstruction method. Additionally, a new way of computing the Gegenbauer coefficients from Jacobian polynomial expansions is introduced that is both more cost effective and less prone to round-off errors.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Zhaoli Guo1 | Chuguang Zheng1  | T. S. Zhao2</authors><title>A Lattice BGK Scheme with General Propagation</title><content>The standard Lattice BGK (LBGK) scheme often encounters numerical instability in simulation of fluid flow with small kinematic viscosity or as the nondimensional relaxation time  is close to 0.5. In this paper, based on a time-splitting scheme for the Boltzmann equation with discrete velocities, a new LBGK scheme with general propagation step is proposed to address this problem. In this model, two free parameters are introduced into the propagation step, which can be adjusted to obtain a small kinematic viscosity and improved numerical stability as well. Numerical simulations of the two-dimensional Taylor vortex and the unsteady Womersley flow are carried out to test the kinematic viscosity, numerical diffusion, and numerical stability of the proposed scheme.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>M.

The new element in this work is the choice of spectral elements for the discretization of the least-squares formulation for its superior accuracy due to the high-order basis-functions. The main issue of this paper is the derivation of a least-squares spectral element formulation for the Stokes equations and the role of the boundary conditions on the coercivity relations. The numerical simulations confirm the usual exponential rate of convergence when p-refinement is applied which is typical for spectral element discretization.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Hoa D.

The algorithm uses a simple finite difference approach, analogous to the method of lines scheme presented in [36]. The zero of a level set function is used to specify the location of the discontinuity. Since a level set function is used to describe the front location, no extra data structures are needed to keep track of the location of the discontinuity. Also, two solution states are used at all computational nodes, one corresponding to the real state, and one corresponding to a ghost node state, analogous to the Ghost Fluid Method of [12]. High order pointwise convergence was demonstrated for scalar linear and nonlinear conservation laws, even at discontinuities and in multiple dimensions in the first paper of this series [3]. The solutions here are compared to standard high order shock capturing schemes, when appropriate. This paper focuses on the issues involved in tracking discontinuities in systems of conservation laws. Examples will be presented of tracking contacts and hydrodynamic shocks in inert and chemically reacting compressible flow.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Fr&amp;eacute d&amp;eacute ric Gibou1 | Ronald Fedkiw2| Russel Caflisch3 | Stanley Osher3</authors><title>A Level Set Approach for the Numerical Simulation of Dendritic Growth</title><content>In this paper, we present a level set approach for the modeling of dendritic solidification.

The complex three-dimensional reactor problem is decomposed into simpler, more manageable problems which are then recombined sequentially by GMRES algorithms. Mathematically, the method consists of using an inner level GMRES to solve the preconditioner equation for an outer level GMRES. Applications were performed on practical, three-dimensional models of operating Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR). Serial and parallel applications were performed for a reactor model with two different details in the core representation. When appropriately tight convergence was enforced at each GMRES level, the results of the semi-iterative solver were in agreement with existing direct solution methods. For the larger model tested, the serial performance of GMRES was about a factor of 3 better than the direct solver and the parallel speedups were about 4 using 13 processors of the INTEL Paragon. Thus, for the larger problem over an order of magnitude reduction in the execution time was achieved indicating that the use of semi-iterative solvers and parallel computing can considerably reduce the computational load for practical PWR transient calculations.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Weizhong Dai1</authors><title>A New ADI Scheme for Solving Three-Dimensional Parabolic Differential Equations</title><content>A new alternating-direction implicit (ADI) scheme for solving three-dimensional parabolic differential equations has been developed based on the idea of regularized difference scheme.

The fluid is a silicone oil (Prandtl number equal to 105) contained in a three-dimensional box bounded by rigid and impermeable walls with top free surface exposed to a gaseous phase. At the lateral box walls a different non-uniform temperature distribution is assumed so to induce horizontal convection and to keep separated thermocapillary and buoyancy effects. The vorticity-velocity formulation of the time-dependent Navier&amp;#x2013;Stokes equations for a non-isothermal incompressible fluid is used.

In this note, we propose to develop and analyze reduced basis methods for simulating hierarchical flow systems, which is of relevance for studying flows in a network of pipes, an example being a set of arteries or veins. We propose to decompose the geometry into generic parts (e.g., pipes and bifurcations), and to contruct a reduced basis for these generic parts by considering representative geometric snapshots. The global system is constructed by gluing the individual basis solutions together via Lagrange multipliers.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Ruben S. Montero1 | Ignacio M.

The two problems associated with this simulation; boundary layers and entering flows with non-aligned characteristics, have been successfully overcome through the combination of a plane-implicit solver and semicoarsening. In fact, this multigrid algorithm exhibits a textbook multigrid convergence rate, i.e., the solution of the discrete system of equations is obtained in a fixed amount of computational work, independently of the grid size, grid stretching factor and non-alignment parameter. Also, a parallel variant of the smoother based on a four-color ordering of planes is investigated.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>C&amp;eacute dric Chauvi&amp;egrave re1  | Robert G.

Symes1  | Jianliang Qian2 </authors><title>A Slowness Matching Eulerian Method for Multivalued Solutions of Eikonal Equations</title><content>Traveltime, or geodesic distance, is locally the solution of the eikonal equation of geometric optics. However traveltime between sufficiently distant points is generically multivalued. Finite difference eikonal solvers approximate only the viscosity solution, which is the smallest value of the (multivalued) traveltime (first arrival time). The slowness matching method stitches together local single-valued eikonal solutions, approximated by a finite difference eikonal solver, to approximate all values of the traveltime. In some applications, it is reasonable to assume that geodesics (rays) have a consistent orientation, so that the eikonal equation may be viewed as an evolution equation in one of the spatial directions. This paraxial assumption simplifies both the efficient computation of local traveltime fields and their combination into global multivalued traveltime fields via the slowness matching algorithm. The cost of slowness matching is on the same order as that of a finite difference solver used to compute the viscosity solution, when traveltimes from many point sources are required as is typical in seismic applications. Adaptive gridding near the source point and a formally third order scheme for the paraxial eikonal combine to give second order convergence of the traveltime branches.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Mejdi Azaiez1 </authors><title>A Spectral Element Projection Scheme for Incompressible Flow with Application to the Unsteady Axisymmetric Stokes Problem</title><content>This paper presents a modified Goda scheme in the simulation of unsteady incompressible Navier&amp;#x2013;Stokes flows in cylindrical geometries.

The resulting matrix corresponding to one-way wave equation based on Pad&amp;eacute; approximation has all eigenvalues in the complex negative half plane which allows stable integration of the underlying system by any ODE solver in the sense of eigenvalue stability.

It is a finite-volume scheme of high order in space and time. The scheme is explicit, fully discrete and advances the solution in one single step. Several numerical tests have been performed. In the first test case the dissipation and dispersion behaviour of the schemes are studied in one space dimension. Dispersion as well as dissipation effects strongly influence the discrete wave propagation over long distances and are very important for, e.g., aeroacoustical calculations. The next test, the so-called co-rotating vortex pair, is a demonstration of the ideas of the two-dimensional ADER approach. The linearised Euler equations are used for the simulation of the sound emitted by a co-rotating vortex pair.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>V. A. Titarev1  | E. F.

The schemes result from extending the ADER approach, which is related to the ENO/WENO methodology. Our schemes are conservative, one-step, explicit and fully discrete, requiring only the computation of the inter-cell fluxes to advance the solution by a full time step; the schemes have optimal stability condition. To compute the intercell flux in one space dimension we solve a generalised Riemann problem by reducing it to the solution a sequence of m conventional Riemann problems for the kth spatial derivatives of the solution, with k=0, 1,..., m&amp;#x2013;1, where m is arbitrary and is the order of the accuracy of the resulting scheme.

Arsham1 </authors><title>Affine Geometric Method For Linear Programs</title><content>The algebraic (simplex) method is a complete enumerating algorithm to solve bounded linear programs (LP). It converts all the inequality constraints to equality to obtain a system of equations by introducing slack/surplus variables, converts all non-restricted (in sign) variables to restricted ones by substituting the difference of two new variables, and finally solves all of its square subsystems. This conversion of an LP into a pure algebraic version overlooks the original space of the decision variables and treats all variables alike throughout the process. We propose an effective three-phase algebraic method to overcome these deficiencies. Phase I concentrates on an early recognition of basic feasible solutions (BFS) which are located on the coordinate axis of each decision variable. Phase II finds the BFS which are on the faces of the coordinate system by solving some subsystems of equations which depend on the number of decision variables and constraints. Finally, in Phase III, it locates the BFS which are not on the faces of the coordinate system. The feasibility test is performed efficiently at the end of each phase. The algorithm works directly with the original variables even if some are unrestricted. The proposed method reduces considerably the computational complexity because it does not include any slack/surplus variables. The algorithmic strategy is to partition the set of BFS into three distinct sub-sets with common characteristics. Numerical examples illustrate the new solution algorithm.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Lel| Jameson1 </authors><title>AMR vs High Order Schemes</title><content>Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) schemes are generally considered promising because of the ability of the scheme to place grid points or computational degrees of freedom at the location in the flow where truncation errors are unacceptably large. For a given order, AMR schemes can reduce work. However, for the computation of turbulent or non-turbulent mixing when compared to high order non-adaptive methods, traditional 2nd order AMR schemes are computationally more expensive. We give precise estimates of work and restrictions on the size of the small scale grid and show that the requirements on the AMR scheme to be cheaper than a high order scheme are unrealistic for most computational scenarios.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Ilaria Perugia1  | Dominik Sch&amp;ouml tzau1 </authors><title>An hp-Analysis of the Local Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Diffusion Problems</title><content>We present an hp-error analysis of the local discontinuous Galerkin method for diffusion problems, considering unstructured meshes with hanging nodes and two- and three-dimensional domains.

The previous approach of the multilevel method was a multiplicative or serial method since each level is addressed sequentially; it presents, as MG methods, a mesh-independent convergence rate. It is more costly than MG methods, but easier to implement. In order to smooth all the frequency components of the error, the V-cycle strategy is used and it results in several cost functional evaluations per cycle. The proposed new strategy is based on an additive approach. A new preconditioner is deduced from this multilevel method, which provides a better efficiency than the previous method since all frequencies are addressed in only one optimization iteration. An abstract analysis seems to indicate a mesh independent convergence rate. All application to unstructured meshes is derived by combining with a volume agglomeration approach and illustrates the behavior predicted by the theory.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>F.

The computational approach employed is based on a mixed implicit/explicit time discretization scheme together with a highly accurate spatial discretization using a PN&amp;#x2013;PN&amp;#x2013;2 spectral-element method. It is well known that this so-called forward-facing step (FFS) flow exhibits a singularity in the pressure and the velocity derivatives at the corner point. We account for this singularity by a geometric mesh refinement strategy that was proposed in a hp-FEM context. A detailed numerical study of the FFS flow reveals that length and height of the recirculation zone in front of the step are almost constant for creeping flow. In the limit of high Reynolds numbers the length and height of the recirculation zone increase proportional to Re0.6 and Re0.2, respectively.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Phu Luong1 | Clay P.

For coastal ocean modeling, in particular, a one-block grid covering the region under study is commonly used. Most bodies of water of interest have complicated coastlines; e.g., the Persian Gulf and Mediterranean Sea. Since such one-block grids are not boundary conforming, the number of unused grid points can be a relatively large portion of the entire domain space. Other disadvantages of using a one block grid include large memory requirements and long computer processing time. Multiblock grid generation and dual-level parallel techniques are used to overcome these problems. Message Passing Interface (MPI) is used to parallelize the Multiblock Grid Princeton Ocean Model (MGPOM) such that each grid block is assigned to a unique processor. Since not all grid blocks are of the same size, the workload varies between MPI processes. To alleviate this, OpenMP dynamic threading is used to improve load balance. Performance results from the MGPOM model on a one-block grid, a twenty block grid, and a forty-two block grid after a 90-day simulation for the Persian Gulf demonstrate the efficacy of the dual-level parallel code version.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Ji&amp;iacute  F&amp;uuml rst1  | Karel Kozel1</authors><title>Application of Second Order TVD and WENO Schemes in Internal Aerodynamics</title><content>We deal with the comparison of several finite volume TVD schemes and finite difference ENO schemes and we describe a second order finite volume WENO scheme which was developed for the case of general unstructured meshes.

These schemes can be used in conjunction with an appropriate spatial discretization scheme for the numerical solution of time dependent conservation equations. The main concept behind these schemes is that the order of accuracy in time is dropped locally in regions where the time evolution of the solution is not smooth. By doing this, an attempt is made at locally satisfying monotonicity conditions, while maintaining a high order of accuracy in most of the solution domain. When a linear high order time integration scheme is used along with a high order spatial discretization, enforcement of monotonicity imposes severe time-step restrictions. We propose to apply limiters to these time-integration schemes, thus making them non-linear. When these new schemes are used with high order spatial discretizations, solutions remain non-oscillatory for much larger time-steps as compared to linear time integration schemes. Numerical results obtained on scalar conservation equations and systems of conservation equations are highly promising.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Andreas Karageorghis1 | Marcin Paprzycki2</authors><title>Conditioning of Pseudospectral Matrices for Certain Domain Decompositions</title><content>In this paper we examine the conditioning of the matrices resulting from certain conforming pseudospectral approximations.

We endeavor to construct the shapes that arise from the Minkowski problem by forming a PDE that flows an initial implicitly defined hypersurface to an approximation of the shape under the level set framework. Tools and ideas found in the various applications of level set methods are gathered to generate this PDE. Numerically, its solution is determined by incorporating high order finite difference schemes over the uniform grid available in the framework. Finally, we use our approach in various test cases to generate various shapes arising from different given data in the Minkowski problem.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Bruno Despr&amp;eacute s1| 2  | Fr&amp;eacute d&amp;eacute ric Lagouti&amp;egrave re1 </authors><title>Contact Discontinuity Capturing Schemes for Linear Advection and Compressible Gas Dynamics</title><content>We present a non-diffusive and contact discontinuity capturing scheme for linear advection and compressible Euler system. In the case of advection, this scheme is equivalent to the Ultra-Bee limiter of [24], [29]. We prove for the Ultra-Bee scheme a property of exact advection for a large set of piecewise constant functions. We prove that the numerical error is uniformly bounded in time for such prepared (i.e., piecewise constant) initial data, and state a conjecture of non-diffusion at infinite time, based on some local over-compressivity of the scheme, for general initial data.

Vorticity Confinement has been shown to efficiently treat thin features in multi-dimensional incompressible fluid flow, such as vortices and streams of passive scalars, and to convect them over long distances with no spreading due to numerical errors. Outside the features, where the flow is irrotational or the scalar vanishes, the method automatically reduces to conventional discretized finite difference fluid dynamic equations. The features are treated as a type of weak solution and, within the features, a nonlinear difference equation, as opposed to finite difference equation, is solved that does not necessarily represent a Taylor expansion discretization of a simple partial differential equation (PDE). The approach is similar to artificial compression and shock capturing schemes, where conservation laws are satisfied across discontinuities. For the features, the result of this conservation is that integral quantities such as total amplitude and centroid motion are accurately computed. Basically, the features are treated as multi-dimensional nonlinear discrete solitary waves that live on the computational lattice. These obey a confinement relation that is a generalization to multiple dimensions of 1-D discontinuity capturing schemes. A major point is that the method involves a discretization of a rotationally invariant operator, rather than a composition of separate 1-D operators, as in conventional discontinuity capturing schemes. The main objective of this paper is to introduce a new formulation of Vorticity Confinement that, compared to the original formulation, is simpler, allows more detailed analysis, and exactly conserves momentum for vortical flow. First, a short critique of conventional methods for these problems is given. The basic new method is then described. Finally, analysis of the new method and initial results are presented.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Henrik Br|&amp;eacute n1  | Sverker Holmgren1 </authors><title>Convergence Acceleration for Hyperbolic Systems Using Semicirculant Approximations</title><content>The iterative solution of systems of equations arising from systems of hyperbolic, time-independent partial differential equations (PDEs) is studied. The PDEs are discretized using a finite volume or finite difference approximation on a structured grid. A convergence acceleration technique where a semicirculant approximation of the spatial difference operator is employed as preconditioner is considered. The spectrum of the preconditioned coefficient matrix is analyzed for a model problem. It is shown that, asymptotically, the time step for the forward Euler method could be chosen as a constant, which is independent of the number of grid points and the artificial viscosity parameter. By linearizing the Euler equations around an approximate solution, a system of linear PDEs with variable coefficients is formed. When utilizing the semicirculant (SC) preconditioner for this problem, which has properties very similar to the full nonlinear equations, numerical experiments show that the favorable convergence properties hold also here. We compare the results for the SC method to those of a multigrid (MG) scheme. The number of iterations and the arithmetic complexities are considered, and it is clear that the SC method is more efficient for the problems studied. Also, the MG scheme is sensitive to the amount of artificial dissipation added, while the SC method is not.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Tao Tang  | Jinghua Wang </authors><title>Convergence of MUSCL Relaxing Schemes to the Relaxed Schemes for Conservation Laws with Stiff Source Terms</title><content>We consider the convergence and stability property of MUSCL relaxing schemes applied to conservation laws with stiff source terms.

In this framework, boundary conditions can be accounted for and the spatial distribution of the errors within individual elements can be obtained. This is of importance for spectral element discretizations, for which it might be convenient to have the element size larger than the wavelength. When applied to multiple element discretizations, this allows identification of criteria for reducing the errors. While these criteria depend in general on the particular application and the discretization itself, an attempt is made to obtain optimal methods for the case when the wave propagation takes place over a large number of elements. Unfortunately, such optimization leads in the most general case to full mass matrices, and hence is useful mainly for linear problems.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Cem M.

In the present, novel method Hermite interpolation is used as point of departure. From this the second order derivative is obtained with degree of precision (2N+1) for the same grid as above. The associated theorem constitutes the main result of this paper. Based on that theorem a method in put forward in which the differential equation and the differentiated differential equation are simultaneously collocated. In this method every grid point counts for two. The double collocation leads to a solution accuracy which is superior to the precision obtained with the conventional method for the same grid. This superiority is demonstrated by 3 examples, 2 linear problems and a non-linear one. In the examples it is shown that the accuracy obtained with the present method is comparable to the solution accuracy of the standard method with twice the number of grid points. However, the condition number of the present method grows like N3 as compared to N2 in the standard method.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Uwe Hollerbach1</authors><title>Effects of Aliasing Errors on Microlithographic Image Computations</title><content>Recent advances in computational microelectronics have made it possible to compute the images of very large masks.

A. Jaberi1 | S. James2</authors><title>Effects of Chemical Reaction on Two-Dimensional Turbulence</title><content>Direct numerical simulations of compressible two-dimensional homogeneous turbulent reacting flows are conducted to investigate the interactions between turbulence and chemical reaction. Both isothermal and exothermic nonpremixed reactions are considered. In isothermal reacting simulations, the turbulence is not affected by the reaction and is characterized by the large scale coherent vortices and vorticity-gradient sheet structures. The spatial structures of the density and temperature fields are similar to that of vorticity. However, mixing and reaction occur in the layer like (lamellar) structures which are mainly formed in the hyperbolic flow regions, where the vorticily-gradient sheets are present and the turbulent stretching dominates the circulation. Analysis of the simulations with exothermic reactions indicates that the heat of reaction has significant influence on thc spatial and the compositional structure of velocity, scalar and thermodynamic variables. The fluctuations of the density, the temperature, the pressure and the dilatation are substantially increased due to nonuniform heat release. The heat of reaction also modifies the small scale solenoidal velocity field. At early times, when the reaction is significant, the magnitude of the vorticity (enstrophy) is enhanced by the baroclinic vorticity generation. At late times, when the reaction is almost completed, the molecular dissipation is dominant and the magnitude of vorticity decays continuously. Examination of the energy transfer among the rotational and the compressive components of the kinetic energy and the internal energy indicates that the energy of reaction is transfered to the compressive component of the kinetic energy by the pressure-dilatation correlations. The turbulent advection then transfer the energy from the compressive component of the kinetic energy to its rotational component.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>F.A.

Madnia1</authors><title>Effects of Heat of Reaction on Homogeneous Compressible Turbulence</title><content>Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of homogeneous compressible turbulent reacting flows are conducted to investigate the effects of heat of reaction on the solenoidal and the dilatational turbulent motions. Consistent with the previous theoretical results, it is shown that the heat of reaction does not have a significant effect on the low order moments of the solenoidal velocity. However, the variances of dilatation, pressure, temperature, and density, increase significantly due to heat release. Also, the magnitudes of the skewness and the kurtosis of dilatation increase significantly as a result of heat of reaction. The high negative values of the dilatation correspond to localized structures with low probability of existence. The heat of reaction also enhances the amplitude and the frequency of the oscillations of the pressure-dilatation correlation. Examination of the energy transfer among rotational and compressive components of the kinetic energy and the internal energy indicates that the energy of the reaction is transferred to the compressive component of the kinetic energy by the pressure-dilatation correlation. The advection term then transfer the energy from the compressive component of the kinetic energy to its rotational component. While the interactions between compressive component of the kinetic energy and the internal energy are significant, those between the rotational and the compressive components of the kinetic energy are relatively weak.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Bernhard M&amp;uuml ller1  | H.

For stability consideration, the Euler equations are split into a conservative and a symmetric non-conservative portion. Due to the large disparity of acoustic and stagnation quantities in low Mach number aeroacoustics, the split Euler equations are formulated in perturbation form to minimize numerical cancellation errors. Spurious oscillations are suppressed by a characteristic-based filter. The method has been applied to accurately simulate the sound emitted by an almost circular Kirchhoff vortex at low Mach numbers.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Erratum</authors><title/></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>J.

Numerical results demonstrate the sixth-order convergence         rate of the image approximation and the O(N) complexity of the fast implementation of the point image approximation.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Wuming Zhu1 | David A.

I.;Single Asset with and;without Jump Diffusion      </title><content>We develop a spectral element method to price single factor European options with and without jump diffusion. The method uses         piecewise high order Legendre polynomial expansions to approximate the option price represented pointwise on a Gauss-Lobatto         mesh within each element, which allows an exact representation of the non-smooth payoff function. The convolution integral         is approximated by high order Gauss-Lobatto quadratures. A second order implicit/explicit (IMEX) approximation is used to         integrate in time, with the convolution integral integrated explicitly. The method is spectrally accurate (exponentially convergent)         in space for the solution and Greeks, and second-order accurate in time. The spectral element solution to the Black-Scholes         equation is ten to one hundred times faster than commonly used second order finite difference methods.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Mofdi El-Amrani1  | Mohammed SeaГЇd2 </authors><title>A Spectral Stochastic Semi-Lagrangian Method for;Convection-Diffusion Equations with;Uncertainty      </title><content>Real life convection-diffusion problems are characterized by their inherent or externally induced uncertainties in the design         parameters. This paper presents a spectral stochastic finite element semi-Lagrangian method for numerical solution of convection-diffusion         equations with uncertainty. Using the spectral decomposition, the stochastic variational problem is reformulated to a set         of deterministic variational problems to be solved for each Wiener polynomial chaos. To obtain the chaos coefficients in the         corresponding deterministic convection-diffusion equations, we implement a semi-Lagrangian method in the finite element framework.         Once this representation is computed, statistics of the numerical solution can be easily evaluated. These numerical techniques         associate the geometrical flexibility of the finite element method with the ability offered by the semi-Lagrangian method         to solve convection-dominated problems using time steps larger than its Eulerian counterpart. Numerical results are shown         for a convection-diffusion problem driven with stochastic velocity and for an incompressible viscous flow problem with a random         force. In both examples, the proposed method demonstrates its ability to better maintain the shape of the solution in the         presence of uncertainties and steep gradients.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>R.

An implicit preconditioned LU-SGS p-multigrid method developed for the spectral difference (SD) Euler         solver by Liang is adopted here. In the original SV solver, the viscous flux was computed with a local discontinuous Galerkin         (LDG) type approach. In this study, an interior penalty approach is developed and tested for both the Laplace and Navier&amp;#8211;Stokes         equations. In addition, the second method of Bassi and Rebay (also known as BR2 approach) is also implemented in the SV context,         and also tested. Their convergence properties are studied with the implicit BLU-SGS approach. Fourier analysis revealed some         interesting advantages for the penalty method over the LDG method. A;convergence speedup of up to 2-3 orders is obtained with         the implicit method. The convergence was further enhanced by employing a p-multigrid algorithm. Numerical simulations were         performed using all the three viscous flux formulations and were compared with existing high order simulations (or in some         cases, analytical solutions). The penalty and the BR2 approaches displayed higher accuracy than the LDG approach. In general,         the numerical results are very promising and indicate that the approach has a great potential for 3D flow problems.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Carlo Lovadina1  | L.

In this limit, explicit numerical schemes suffer from numerical constraints related to the small Debye length and         large plasma frequency. Here, we propose a semi-Lagrangian scheme for the Vlasov-Poisson model in the quasi-neutral limit.         The main ingredient relies on a reformulation of the Poisson equation derived in (Crispel et al. in C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris,         Ser. I 341:341&amp;#8211;346, 2005) which enables asymptotically stable simulations. This scheme has a comparable numerical cost per time step to that of an         explicit scheme. Moreover, it is not constrained by a restriction on the size of the time and length step when the Debye length         and plasma period go to zero. A stability analysis and numerical simulations confirm this statement.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>S. C. Brenner1| 2 | T. Gudi2 | L. Owens3  | L.-Y.

Brief review         of the CVT (centroidal Voronoi tessellation) approaches to reduced-order basis are provided. In CVT-reduced order modelling,         we start with a snapshot set just as is done in a SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)-based setting. A weighted (nonuniform         density) CVT is introduced and low-order approximate solution and compensator-based control design of Burgers equation is         discussed. Through CVT-nonuniform method, the low-order basis is obtained. Then this low-order basis is applied to low-order         approximate solution and functional gains to design a low-order controller, and by using the low-order basis order of control         modelling was reduced. Numerical experiments show that a solution of reduced-order controlled Burgers equation performs well         in comparison with a solution of full order controlled Burgers equation.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>J.

The corresponding two-level preconditioner combines traditional and projection-type preconditioners to get rid of the effect         of both small and large eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix. In the literature, various two-level PCG methods are known,         coming from the fields of deflation, domain decomposition and multigrid. Even though these two-level methods differ a lot         in their specific components, it can be shown that from an abstract point of view they are closely related to each other.         We investigate their equivalences, robustness, spectral and convergence properties, by accounting for their implementation,         the effect of roundoff errors and their sensitivity to inexact coarse solves, severe termination criteria and perturbed starting         vectors.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Yana Di1  | Ruo Li2 </authors><title>Computation of Dendritic Growth with Level Set Model Using a Multi-Mesh Adaptive Finite Element Method      </title><content>In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-mesh h-adaptive algorithm to solve the level set model of dendritic growth. Since the level set function is used to provide implicitly         the location of the phase interface, it is resolved by an h-adaptive mesh with refinement only around the phase interface, while the thermal field is approximated on another h-adaptive mesh. The proposed method not only can enjoy the merits of the level set function to handle complex evolution of         the free boundary, but also can achieve the similar accuracy as the front tracking method for the sharp interface model with         about the same degrees of freedom. The algorithm is applied to the simulation of the dendritic crystallization in a pure undercooled         melt. The accuracy is verified by comparing the computational dendrite tip velocity with solvability theory.

Inhomogeneous         obstacles may require a volumetric discretization, such as the Finite Element Method (FEM), and for this approach to be feasible         the exterior domain must be truncated and an appropriate condition enforced at the far, artificial, boundary. An exact, non-reflecting         boundary condition can be stated using the classical DtN-FE method if the Artificial Boundary&amp;#8217;s shape is quite specific: circular         or elliptical. Recently, this approach has been generalized to permit quite general Artificial Boundaries which are shaped         as perturbations of a circle resulting in the &amp;#8220;Enhanced DtN-FE&amp;#8221; method. In this paper we extend this method to a two-dimensional         FEM featuring high-order polynomials in order to realize a high rate of convergence. This is more involved than simply specifying         high-order test and trial functions as now the scatterer shape and Artificial Boundary must be faithfully represented. This         entails boundary elements which conform (to high order) to the true boundary shapes. As we show, this can be accomplished         and we realize an arbitrary order FEM without spurious reflections.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Olivier Pironneau1 </authors><title>Finite Element Characteristic Methods Requiring no;Quadrature      </title><content>The characteristic methods are known to be very efficient for convection-diffusion problems including the Navier-Stokes equations.

We present         numerical evidence for the accuracy of the solution and its gradients for different treatments at the interface using the         Ghost Fluid Method for Poisson problems of Gibou et al. (J. Comput. Phys. 176:205&amp;#8211;227, 2002; 202:577&amp;#8211;601, 2005). This paper is therefore intended as a guide for those interested in using the GFM for Poisson-type problems (and by consequence         diffusion-like problems and Stefan-type problems) by providing the pros and cons of the different choices for defining the         ghost values and locating the interface. We found that in order to obtain second-order-accurate gradients, both a quadratic         (or higher order) extrapolation for defining the ghost values and a quadratic (or higher order) interpolation for finding         the interface location are required. In the case where the ghost values are defined by a linear extrapolation, the gradients         of the solution converge slowly (at most first order in average) and the convergence rate oscillates, even when the interface         location is defined by a quadratic interpolation. The same conclusions hold true for the combination of a quadratic extrapolation         for the ghost cells and a linear interpolation. The solution is second-order accurate in all cases. Defining the ghost values         with quadratic extrapolations leads to a non-symmetric linear system with a worse conditioning than that of the linear extrapolation         case, for which the linear system is symmetric and better conditioned. We conclude that for problems where only the solution         matters, the method described by Gibou, F., Fedkiw, R., Cheng, L.-T. and Kang, M. in (J. Comput. Phys. 176:205&amp;#8211;227, 2002) is advantageous since the linear system that needs to be inverted is symmetric. In problems where the solution gradient         is needed, such as in Stefan-type problems, higher order extrapolation schemes as described by Gibou, F. and Fedkiw,;R. in         (J. Comput.

This undesirable phenomenon may hamper the performance of the layer, which is designed to truncate the computational domain         for unsteady wave propagation problems. For unsplit PMLs, prior studies have attributed the growth to the presence of multiple         eigenvalues in the amplification matrix of the governing system of differential equations. In the current paper, we analyze         the temporal behavior of unsplit PMLs for some commonly used second order explicit finite-difference schemes that approximate         the Maxwell&amp;#8217;s equations. Our conclusion is that on top of having the PML as a potential source of long-time growth, the type         of the layer and the choice of the scheme play a major role in how rapidly this growth may manifest itself and whether or         not it manifests itself at all.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Susanne C.

Furthermore, they         satisfy optimal order error estimates on properly graded meshes, and their analysis is greatly simplified by the underlying         compact embedding of H         0(curl;&amp;#937;)&amp;#8745;H(div0;&amp;#937;) in L         2(&amp;#937;). The performance and the relative merits of these eigensolvers are demonstrated through numerical experiments.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Marcos Pimenta de Abreu1 </authors><title>On the Dependence of Discrete Ordinates Models for;Layer Reflectance and Transmittance on Relative Optical Depth and Solar         Zenith Angle      </title><content>We investigate the effect of layer optical depth and solar zenith angle on recently developed discrete ordinates models for         the diffuse reflectance and transmittance of an optically stationary atmospheric boundary layer. We start with a mathematical         formulation of the atmospheric radiative transfer problems dealt with in this article, and we consider a discrete ordinates         version of the governing equations. For the sake of continuity, we give a brief account of our recently developed models,         and assuming steadiness with respect to the inherent optical properties, we work on the dependence of our models on two target         parameters: the relative optical depth of the boundary layer and solar zenith angle. As a result, we get optimized relations         for our models in terms of the target parameters. To illustrate the relevance of such relations, we present results of computer         simulations using problem sets basic to solar-atmospheric science applications such as environmental remote sensing, radiation         dosimetry, and solar power plants.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Emmanuil H.

It is known that the p-IPDG method admits slightly suboptimal a-priori bounds with respect to the polynomial degree (in the Hilbertian Sobolev space         setting). An example for which the suboptimal rate of convergence with respect to the polynomial degree is both proven theoretically         and validated in practice through numerical experiments is presented. Moreover, the performance of p-IPDG on the related problem of p-approximation of corner singularities is assessed both theoretically and numerically, witnessing an almost doubling of the         convergence rate of the p-IPDG method.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>AyГ§&amp;#305 l Г‡e&amp;#351 melio&amp;#287 lu1 | BГ©atrice RiviГЁre1 </authors><title>Primal Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for;Time-Dependent Coupled Surface and;Subsurface;Flow      </title><content>This paper introduces and analyzes a numerical method based on discontinuous finite element methods for solving the two-dimensional         coupled problem of time-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with the Darcy equations through Beaver-Joseph-Saffman&amp;#8217;s         condition on the interface.

While most existing         fast schemes for this task rely on so called &amp;#8220;iterative&amp;#8221; solvers, the method described here solves the linear system directly         (to within an arbitrary predefined accuracy). The method is described for the particular case of an operator defined on a         square uniform grid, but can be generalized other geometries. For a grid containing N points, a single solve requires O(Nlog&amp;#8201;2         N) arithmetic operations and                    storage. Storing the information required to perform additional solves rapidly requires O(Nlog&amp;#8201;N) storage. The scheme is particularly efficient in situations involving domains that are loaded on the boundary only and where         the solution is sought only on the boundary. In this environment, subsequent solves (after the first) can be performed in                            operations. The efficiency of the scheme is illustrated with numerical examples.

Numerical results and examples are presented and compared for several selection of         fiber parameters. The obtained results show that the semi-Lagrangian method is able to reproduce accurately the time development         of functionals of the process that are important for the quality assessment of industrial fibers.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Hirofumi Notsu1  | Masahisa Tabata1 </authors><title>A Single-Step Characteristic-Curve Finite Element Scheme of Second Order in Time for the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations      </title><content>In this paper we present a new single-step characteristic-curve finite element scheme of second order in time for the nonstationary         incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.

First, we use the artificial boundary method (Han in Frontiers and Prospects of Contemporary Applied Mathematics, [2005]) to reduce the original problem to a problem on bounded computational domain. Then we propose a new approach to construct         a discrete scheme for the reduced problem, where our finite point method has been tailored to some particular properties or         solutions of the problem. From the numerical results, we find that our new methods can achieve very high accuracy with very         coarse mesh even for very small &amp;#949;. In the contrast, the traditional finite element method does not get satisfactory numerical results with the same mesh.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Haotao Cai1 </authors><title>An Efficient Algorithm for Solving the Generalized Airfoil Equation      </title><content>In this paper, we develop an efficient Petrov-Galerkin method for the generalized airfoil equation. In general, the Petrov-Galerkin         method for this equation leads to a linear system with a dense coefficient matrix. When the order of the coefficient matrix         is large, the complexity for solving the corresponding linear system is huge. For this purpose, we propose a matrix truncation         strategy to compress the dense coefficient matrix into a sparse matrix. Subsequently, we use a numerical integration method         to generate the fully discrete truncated linear system. At last we solve the corresponding linear system by the multilevel         augmentation method. An optimal order of the approximate solution is preserved. The computational complexity for generating         the fully discrete truncated linear system and solving it is estimated to be linear up to a logarithm. The spectral condition         number of the truncated matrix is proved to be bounded. Numerical examples complete the paper.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Christophe V|ekerckhove1 | Ioannis Kevrekidis2 | Dirk Roose1</authors><title>An Efficient Newton-Krylov Implementation of;the;Constrained Runs Scheme for Initializing on;a;Slow;Manifold      </title><content>The long-term dynamic behavior of many dynamical systems evolves on a low-dimensional, attracting, invariant slow manifold,         which can be parameterized by only a few variables (&amp;#8220;observables&amp;#8221;). The explicit derivation of such a slow manifold (and thus,         the reduction of the long-term system dynamics) is often extremely difficult or practically impossible. For this class of         problems, the equation-free framework has been developed to enable performing coarse-grained computations, based on short         full model simulations. Each full model simulation should be initialized so that the full model state is consistent with the         values of the observables and close to the slow manifold. To compute such an initial full model state, a class of constrained         runs functional iterations was proposed (Gear and Kevrekidis, J. Sci. Comput. 25(1), 17&amp;#8211;28, 2005; Gear et al., SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst. 4(3), 711&amp;#8211;732, 2005). The schemes in this class only use the full model simulator and converge, under certain conditions, to an approximation         of the desired state on the slow manifold. In this article, we develop an implementation of the constrained runs scheme that         is based on a (preconditioned) Newton-Krylov method rather than on a simple functional iteration. The functional iteration         and the Newton-Krylov method are compared in detail using a lattice Boltzmann model for one-dimensional reaction-diffusion         as the full model simulator. Depending on the parameters of the lattice Boltzmann model, the functional iteration may converge         slowly or even diverge. We show that both issues are largely resolved by using the Newton-Krylov method, especially when a         coarse grid correction preconditioner is incorporated.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Bernardo Cockburn1 | Guido Kanschat2  | Dominik SchГ¶tzau3 </authors><title>An Equal-Order DG Method for the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations      </title><content>We introduce and analyze a discontinuous Galerkin method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations that is based on finite         element spaces of the same polynomial order for the approximation of the velocity and the pressure.

We consider two         different versions of the WAF method, by approximating the intermediate waves using the flux of HLL or the direct approach         of HLLC solver. It is seen that both versions can be written under the same form with different definitions for the approximation         of the velocity waves. We also propose an extension of the method to non-homogeneous systems. In the case of homogeneous systems         it is seen that we can rewrite the third component of the numerical flux in terms of an intermediate wave speed approximation.         We conclude that&amp;#8212;in order to have the same relation for non-homogeneous systems&amp;#8212;the approximation of the intermediate wave         speed must be modified. The proposed extension of the WAF method preserves all stationary solutions, up to second order accuracy,         and water at rest in an exact way, even with arbitrary pollutant concentration.

Earlier work has exploited         such geometries by approximating the solution as a truncated Fourier series in the z-direction. In this paper we propose a new solution algorithm which also exploits the tensor-product feature between the xy-plane and the z-direction. However, the new algorithm is not limited to periodic boundary conditions, but works for general Dirichlet and         Neumann type of boundary conditions. The proposed algorithm also works for problems with variable coefficients as long as         these can be expressed as a separable function with respect to the variation in the xy-plane and the variation in the z-direction. For problems where the new method is applicable, the computational cost is very competitive with the best iterative         solvers. The new algorithm is easy to implement, and useful, both in a serial and parallel context.

This paper reviews mathematical modeling, analysis and simulation of growth, structure and pattern formation for epitaxial         systems, using an island dynamics/level set method for growth and a lattice statics model for strain. Epitaxial growth involves         physics on both atomistic and continuum length scales. For example, diffusion of adatoms can be coarse-grained, but nucleation         of new islands and breakup for existing islands are best described atomistically. In heteroepitaxial growth, mismatch between         the lattice spacing of the substrate and the film will introduce a strain into the film, which can significantly influence         the material structure, for example leading to formation of quantum dots. Technological applications of epitaxial structures,         such as quantum dot arrays, require a degree of geometric uniformity that has been difficult to achieve. Modeling and simulation         may contribute insights that will help to overcome this problem. We present simulations that combine growth and strain showing         the structure of nanocrystals and the formation of patterns in epitaxial systems.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>M.

A direct approximation v                     h             of v can be obtained from the approximation u                     h             of u.

While most work has been focused on shape         priors which are constant in time, it is clear that when tracking deformable shapes certain silhouettes may become more or         less likely over time. In fact, the deformations of familiar objects such as the silhouettes of a walking person are often         characterized by pronounced temporal correlations.                     In this paper, we propose a nonlinear dynamical shape prior for level set based image segmentation. Specifically, we propose               to approximate the temporal evolution of the eigenmodes of the level set function by means of a mixture of autoregressive               models. We detail how such shape priors &amp;#8220;with memory&amp;#8221; can be integrated into a variational framework for level set segmentation.

The problem is that on         one hand one needs it for the stability of the scheme and on the other hand one wishes to get rid of it for obtaining good         quality of the solution. In this paper we are going to present a new approach for tackling this problem by developing a new         type of finite volume scheme for the linear advection equation. The scheme computes approximations to both the solution and         entropy, which are then used in the reconstruction of solution in each cell. Ultra-bee limitation is performed in the solution         reconstruction to eliminate the spurious oscillations near discontinuities. Designed in such a way, the scheme maintains the         conservation of both the solution and entropy, and in this sense the scheme is numerically neither dissipative nor compressive.         We then apply this method to the linearly degenerated second characteristic field of the Euler system to improve the resolution         of numerical solution there. Numerical examples of both the linear advection equation and Euler system are displayed to show         the efficiency of the method.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Florentina Tone1 </authors><title>On the Long-Time H         2-Stability of the Implicit Euler Scheme for the 2D Magnetohydrodynamics Equations      </title><content>Pursuing our work in Tone (Asymptot.

It is based on second order compact finite difference discretization         of the fourth order streamfunction equation on computational plane. The important advantage of this formulation is not only         to overcome the difficulties existing in the velocity-pressure and streamfunction-vorticity formulations, but also for being         applicable to complex geometries beyond rectangular. We first apply the proposed scheme to a problem having analytical solution         and then to the well-studied benchmark problem (problem of lid-driven cavity flow) in viscous fluid flow. Finally, we demonstrate         the robustness of our proposed scheme on flow in a complex domain (e.g. constricted channel and dilated channel). It is seen         to efficiently capture steady state solutions of the N-S equations with Dirichlet as well as Neumann boundary conditions.         In addition to this, it captures viscous flows involving free and wall bounded shear layers which invariably contain spatial         scale variations. Estimates of the error incurred show that the results are very accurate on a coarser grid. The results obtained         using this scheme are in excellent agreement with analytical and numerical results whenever available and they clearly demonstrate         the superior scale resolution of the proposed scheme.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>David Walfisch1 | Jennifer K.

One of the fundamental properties of the DG methodology and arguably         its most powerful property is the ability to combine high-order discretizations on an inter-element level while allowing discontinuities         between elements. This flexibility, however, generates a plethora of difficulties when one attempts to use DG fields for feature         extraction and visualization, as most post-processing schemes are not designed for handling explicitly discontinuous fields.         This work introduces a new method of applying smoothness-increasing, accuracy-conserving filtering on discontinuous Galerkin         vector fields for the purpose of enhancing streamline integration. The filtering discussed in this paper enhances the smoothness         of the field and eliminates the discontinuity between elements, thus resulting in more accurate streamlines. Furthermore,         as a means of minimizing the computational cost of the method, the filtering is done in a one-dimensional manner along the         streamline.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Marcus J.

In this paper we propose two approaches for computing multi-valued quantities related to density, momentum         as well as energy.

In this paper we present a unified formulation for the development of high-order accurate         streamline tracing algorithms on unstructured triangular and quadrilateral grids. The main result of this paper is the identification         of velocity spaces that are suitable for streamline tracing. The essential requirement is that the divergence-free part of         the velocity must induce a stream function. We recognize several classes of velocity spaces satisfying this requirement from         the theory of mixed finite element methods and, for each class, we obtain the precise functional form of the stream function.         Not surprisingly, the most widely used tracing algorithm (Pollock&amp;#8217;s method) emanates in fact from the lowest-order admissible         velocity approximation. Therefore, we provide a sound theoretical justification for the low-order algorithms currently in         use, and we show how to achieve higher-order accuracy both in the streamline tracing and the travel time computation.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Xiaobing Feng1  | Michael Neilan1 </authors><title>Vanishing Moment Method and Moment Solutions for;Fully Nonlinear Second Order Partial Differential Equations      </title><content>This paper concerns with numerical approximations of solutions of fully nonlinear second order partial differential equations         (PDEs). A new notion of weak solutions, called moment solutions, is introduced for fully nonlinear second order PDEs. Unlike         viscosity solutions, moment solutions are defined by a constructive method, called the vanishing moment method, and hence,         they can be readily computed by existing numerical methods such as finite difference, finite element, spectral Galerkin, and         discontinuous Galerkin methods. The main idea of the proposed vanishing moment method is to approximate a fully nonlinear         second order PDE by a higher order, in particular, a quasilinear fourth order PDE. We show by various numerical experiments         the viability of the proposed vanishing moment method. All our numerical experiments show the convergence of the vanishing         moment method, and they also show that moment solutions coincide with viscosity solutions whenever the latter exist.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>H.

Models for these processes should account for gaseous transport in a range of flow regimes, from continuum flow         to free molecular or Knudsen flow, and for chemical reactions at the wafer surface. We develop a kinetic transport and reaction         model whose mathematical representation is a system of transient linear Boltzmann equations. In addition to time, a deterministic         numerical solution of this system of kinetic equations requires the discretization of both position and velocity spaces, each         two-dimensional for 2-D/2-D or each three-dimensional for 3-D/3-D simulations. Discretizing the velocity space by a spectral         Galerkin method approximates each Boltzmann equation by a system of transient linear hyperbolic conservation laws. The classical         choice of basis functions based on Hermite polynomials leads to dense coefficient matrices in this system. We use a collocation         basis instead that directly yields diagonal coefficient matrices, allowing for more convenient simulations in higher dimensions.         The systems of conservation laws are solved using the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. First, we simulate chemical         vapor deposition in both two and three dimensions in typical micron scale features as application example. Second, stability         and convergence of the numerical method are demonstrated numerically in two and three dimensions.

Even though these oscillations are small in magnitude and do not affect the &amp;#8220;essentially         non-oscillatory&amp;#8221; property of WENO schemes, they are indeed responsible for the numerical residue to hang at the truncation         error level of the scheme instead of settling down to machine zero.

In [(2005). Comput.         Methods Appl. Mech.

In most of the DG papers         in the literature, the Lax&amp;#8211;Friedrichs numerical flux is used due to its simplicity, although there are many other numerical         fluxes, which could also be used.

The implicit solver can employ up to sixth-order spatial formulations and tenth-order filtering. The parallelization of the solver is founded on the overset grid technique. LES were then performed for turbulent channel flow with Reynolds numbers ranging from Re                &amp;#964;=180 to 590, and flow past a circular cylinder with a transitional wake at Re                                  D                =3900.

Inviscid Compressible Flow in One Space Dimension      </title><content>In this paper, we propose an explicit discontinuous Galerkin scheme for conservation laws which is of arbitrary order of accuracy         in space and time. The basic idea is to use a Taylor expansion in space and time to define a space&amp;#8211;time polynomial in each         space&amp;#8211;time element. The space derivatives are given by the approximate solution at the old time level, the time derivatives         and the mixed space&amp;#8211;time derivatives are computed from these space derivatives using the so-called Cauchy&amp;#8211;Kovalevskaya procedure.         The space&amp;#8211;time volume integral is approximated by Gauss quadrature with values at the space&amp;#8211;time Gaussian points obtained         from the Taylor expansion. The flux in the surface integral is approximated by a numerical flux with arguments given by the         Taylor expansions from the left and from the right-hand side of the element interface. The locality of the presented method         together with the space&amp;#8211;time expansion gives the attractive feature that the time steps may be different in each grid cell.         Hence, we drop the common global time levels and propose that every grid zone runs with its own time step which is determined         by the local stability restriction. In spite of the local time steps the scheme is locally conservative, fully explicit, and         arbitrary order accurate in space and time for transient calculations. Numerical results are shown for the one-dimensional         Euler equations with orders of accuracy one up to six in space and time.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>G.

In the second part we extend the scheme to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in         multi dimensions. It is based on a space-time Taylor expansion at the old time level in which all time or mixed space-time         derivatives are replaced by space derivatives using the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya procedure. The surface and volume integrals in         the variational formulation are approximated by Gaussian quadrature with the values of the space-time approximate solution.         The numerical fluxes at grid cell interfaces are based on the approximate solution of generalized Riemann problems for both,         the inviscid and viscous part. The presented scheme has to satisfy a stability restriction similar to all other explicit DG         schemes which becomes more restrictive for higher orders. The loss of efficiency, especially in the case of strongly varying         sizes of grid cells is circumvented by use of different time steps in different grid cells. The presented time accurate numerical         simulations run with local time steps adopted to the local stability restriction in each grid cell. In numerical simulations         for the two-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations we show the efficiency and the optimal order of convergence being         p+1, when a polynomial approximation of degree p is used.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Juan-Ming Yuan1 | Jie Shen2  | Jiahong Wu3 </authors><title>A Dual-Petrov-Galerkin Method for the;Kawahara-Type;Equations      </title><content>         An efficient and accurate numerical scheme is proposed, analyzed and implemented for the Kawahara and modified Kawahara equations         which model many physical phenomena such as gravity-capillary waves and magneto-sound propagation in plasmas.

The L-shaped region is partitioned into three nonoverlapping rectangular subregions with two interfaces and the rectangle with         the cross-point is partitioned into four rectangular subregions with four interfaces. In each rectangular subregion, the approximate         solution is a polynomial tensor product that satisfies Poisson&amp;#8217;s equation at the collocation points. The approximate solution         is continuous on the entire domain and its normal derivatives are continuous at the collocation points on the interfaces,         but continuity of the normal derivatives across the interfaces is not guaranteed. At the cross point, we require continuity         of the normal derivative in the vertical direction. The solution of the collocation problem is first reduced to finding the         approximate solution on the interfaces. The discrete Steklov&amp;#8211;PoincarГ© operator corresponding to the interfaces is self-adjoint         and positive definite with respect to the discrete inner product associated with the collocation points on the interfaces.         The approximate solution on the interfaces is computed using the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. A preconditioner         is obtained from the discrete Steklov&amp;#8211;PoincarГ© operators corresponding to pairs of the adjacent rectangular subregions. Once         the solution of the discrete Steklov&amp;#8211;PoincarГ© equation is obtained, the collocation solution in each rectangular subregion         is computed using a matrix decomposition method. The total cost of the algorithm is O(N         3), where the number of unknowns is proportional to N         2.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Colin B.

This combination is not         possible within the classes of Runge&amp;#8211;Kutta or linear multistep methods and therefore appears promising for the strong stability         preserving (SSP) time-stepping community which is generally concerned with computing oscillation-free numerical solutions         of PDEs. Using a variety of numerical test problems, we show that although second- and third-order unconditionally contractive         DSRK methods do preserve the strong stability property for all time step-sizes, they suffer from order reduction at large         step-sizes. Indeed, for time-steps larger than those typically chosen for explicit methods, these DSRK methods behave like         first-order implicit methods. This is unfortunate, because it is precisely to allow a large time-step that we choose to use         implicit methods. These results suggest that unconditionally contractive DSRK methods are limited in usefulness as they are         unable to compete with either the first-order backward Euler method for large step-sizes or with Crank&amp;#8211;Nicolson or high-order         explicit SSP Runge&amp;#8211;Kutta methods for smaller step-sizes.                                             We also present stage order conditions for DSRK methods and show that the observed order reduction is associated with the               necessarily low stage order of the unconditionally contractive DSRK methods.                           </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Ruo Li1 | Wenbin Liu2  | Ningning Yan3 </authors><title>A Posteriori Error Estimates of Recovery Type for;Distributed Convex Optimal Control Problems      </title><content>         In this paper, we derive a posteriori error estimates of recovery type, and present the superconvergence analysis for the         finite element approximation of distributed convex optimal control problems.

We start by analyzing boundary operators         leading to the well-posedness of the problem. In addition, equivalent characteristic boundary conditions of common physical         boundary conditions are discussed. These theoretical results are further employed to construct a Legendre pseudospectral penalty         scheme based on a tensor product formulation for approximating waves on a general curvilinear quadrilateral domain. A stability         analysis of the scheme is conducted for the case where a straight-sided quadrilateral element is used. The analysis shows         that, by properly setting the penalty parameters, the scheme is stable at the semi-discrete level. Numerical experiments for         testing the performance of the scheme are conducted, and the expected p- and h-convergence patterns are observed. Moreover, the numerical computations also show that the scheme is time stable, which makes         the scheme suitable for long time simulations.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Han Chen1| Chohong Min2 | FrГ©dГ©ric Gibou3 </authors><title>A Supra-Convergent Finite Difference Scheme for the Poisson and Heat Equations on Irregular Domains and Non-Graded Adaptive         Cartesian Grids      </title><content>We present finite difference schemes for solving the variable coefficient Poisson and heat equations on irregular domains         with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The computational domain is discretized with non-graded Cartesian grids, i.e., grids for         which the difference in size between two adjacent cells is not constrained. Refinement criteria is based on proximity to the         irregular interface such that cells with the finest resolution is placed on the interface. We sample the solution at the cell         vertices (nodes) and use quadtree (in 2D) or octree (in 3D) data structures as efficient means to represent the grids. The         boundary of the irregular domain is represented by the zero level set of a signed distance function. For cells cut by the         interface, the location of the intersection point is found by a quadratic fitting of the signed distance function, and the         Dirichlet boundary value is obtained by quadratic interpolation. Instead of using ghost nodes outside the interface, we use         directly this intersection point in the discretization of the variable coefficient Laplacian. These methods can be applied         in a dimension-by-dimension fashion, producing schemes that are straightforward to implement. Our method combines the ability         of adaptivity on quadtrees/octrees with a quadratic treatment of the Dirichlet boundary condition on the interface.

It is well known that approximations to linear functionals obtained by discontinuous Galerkin methods with polynomials         of degree k can be proven to converge with order 2k +;1 and 2k for ordinary differential and convection&amp;#8211;diffusion equations, respectively.

The distinctive feature of this method is that the stabilization parameters associated with the numerical         trace of the flux are identically equal to zero in the interior of the domain; this is why its dissipation is said to be minimal.         We show that the orders of convergence of the approximations for the potential and the flux using polynomials of degree k are the same as those of all known discontinuous Galerkin methods, namely, (k;+;1) and k, respectively. Our numerical results verify that these orders of convergence are sharp. The novelty of the analysis is that         it bypasses a seemingly indispensable condition, namely, the positivity of the above mentioned stabilization parameters, by         using a new, carefully defined projection tailored to the very definition of the numerical traces.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>P.

The result is compared to the original data to estimate the error. Although inappropriate for parabolic and other non-reversible         partial differential equations, it is useful for often troublesome advection terms. The error estimate is used to correct         the data before advection raising the method to second order accuracy, even though each individual step is only first order         accurate. In this paper, we rewrite the MacCormack method to illustrate that it estimates the error in the same exact fashion         as BFECC. The difference is that the MacCormack method uses this error estimate to correct the already computed forward advected         data. Thus, it does not require the third advection step in BFECC reducing the cost of the method while still obtaining second         order accuracy in space and time. Recent work replaced each of the three BFECC advection steps with a simple first order accurate         unconditionally stable semi-Lagrangian method yielding a second order accurate unconditionally stable BFECC scheme.

The concentration method, introduced by Gelb and Tadmor in 1999,         locates jump discontinuities in piecewise smooth functions from their Fourier spectral data. However, as is true for all global         techniques, the method yields strong oscillations near the jump discontinuities, which makes it difficult to distinguish true         discontinuities from artificial oscillations. This paper introduces refinements to the concentration method to reduce the         oscillations. These refinements also improve the results in noisy environments. One technique adds filtering to the concentration         method. Another uses convolution to determine the strongest correlations between the waveform produced by the concentration         method and the one produced by the jump function approximation of an indicator function. A zero crossing based concentration         factor, which creates a more localized formulation of the jump function approximation, is also introduced. Finally, the effects         of zero-mean white Gaussian noise on the refined concentration method are analyzed. The investigation confirms that by applying         the refined techniques, the variance of the concentration method is significantly reduced in the presence of noise.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Hudong Chen1| Isaac Goldhirsch1| 2 | Steven A.

A comparison between the most popular choices of Runge-Kutta (RK) methods is made from the point of view of accuracy         and computational work. By choosing the strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK) time-integration method of order         consistent with the polynomial order of the spatial discretisation, better accuracy can be attained compared with fixed-order         schemes. Moreover, this comes without a significant increase in the computational work. A numerical Fourier analysis is performed         for this Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) discretisation to gain insight into the dispersion and dissipation properties         of the fully discrete scheme. The analysis is carried out on both the one-dimensional and the two-dimensional fully discrete         schemes and, in the latter case, on uniform as well as on non-uniform meshes.

The CPG method is based on the orthogonality property         of the kth-derivative of the Chebyshev polynomials.

For an efficient numerical solution the problem is transformed to a finite interval and         polynomial collocation is applied to the resulting boundary value problem with essential singularity. We demonstrate that         this problem is well-posed and the involved collocation methods show their classical convergence order. Moreover, we investigate         what problem statement yields favorable conditioning of the associated collocation equations. Thus, collocation methods provide         a sound basis for the implementation of a standard code equipped with an a posteriori error estimate and an adaptive mesh         selection procedure. We present a code based on these algorithmic components that we are currently developing especially for         the numerical solution of singular boundary value problems of arbitrary, mixed order, which also admits to solve problems         in an implicit formulation. Finally, we compare our approach to a solution method proposed in the literature and conclude         that collocation is an easy to use, reliable and highly accurate way to solve problems of the present type.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>L.

While the generalized binary trees as an unstructured data structure can store solution information         efficiently if combined with a good adaptive strategy, virtual uniform meshes allow us to take advantage of many well-developed         ENO numerical methods based on uniform meshes.

Grains are material regions         with different lattice orientation which are frequently in addition elastically stressed. At the same time, new microscopic         simulation tools allow to study the dynamics of such grain structures. Single atoms are resolved experimentally as well as         in simulation results on the data microscale, whereas lattice orientation and elastic deformation describe corresponding physical         structures mesoscopically. A qualitative study of experimental images and simulation results and the comparison of simulation         and experiment requires the robust and reliable extraction of mesoscopic properties from the microscopic image data. Based         on a Mumford&amp;#8211;Shah type functional, grain boundaries are described as free discontinuity sets at which the orientation parameter         for the lattice jumps. The lattice structure itself is encoded in a suitable integrand depending on a local lattice orientation         and one global elastic displacement. For each grain a lattice orientation and an elastic displacement function are considered         as unknowns implicitly described by the image microstructure. In addition the approach incorporates solid&amp;#8211;liquid interfaces.         The resulting Mumford&amp;#8211;Shah functional is approximated with a level set active contour model following the approach by Chan         and Vese.

As is well known the use of staggered grids (e.g. MAC grids, Peri&amp;#263;et al. Comput. Fluids,16(4), 389&amp;#8211;403, (1988)) is a serious impediment for the implementation of multilevel schemes in the context of finite differences.         This difficulty is circumvented here by the use of a colocated finite volume discretization (Faureet al. (2004a) Submitted, Peri&amp;#263;et al. Comput. Fluids,16(4), 389&amp;#8211;403, (1988)), for which the algebra of multilevel methods is much simpler than in the context of MAC type finite         differences. The general ideas and the numerical simulations are presented in this article in the simplified context of a         two-dimensional Burgers equations; the two-, and three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations introducing new difficulties related         to the incompressibility condition and the time discretization, will be considered elsewhere (see Faureet al.

In the case of the gas dynamics equations the previous formulation leads to an         entropy preserving (EP) scheme. It is shown in the present paper that it is also possible to construct the flux of a conservative         finite volume scheme to produce a kinetic energy preserving (KEP) scheme which exactly satisfies the global conservation law         for kinetic energy. A proof is presented for three dimensional discretization on arbitrary grids. Both the EP and KEP schemes         have been applied to the direct numerical simulation of one-dimensional viscous flow in a shock tube.

Vatsa1</authors><title>Fourth-order runge-kutta schemes for fluid mechanics applications      </title><content>Multiple high-order time-integration schemes are used to solve stiff test problems related to the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations.         The primary objective is to determine whether high-order schemes can displace currently used second-order schemes on stiff         NS and Reynolds averaged NS (RANS) problems, for a meaningful portion of the work-precision spectrum. Implicit-Explicit (IMEX)         schemes are used on separable problems that naturally partition into stiff and nonstiff components. Non-separable problems         are solved with fully implicit schemes, oftentimes the implicit portion of an IMEX scheme. The convection-diffusion-reaction         (CDR) equations allow a term by term stiff/nonstiff partition that is often well suited for IMEX methods. Major variables         in CDR converge at near design-order rates with all formulations, including the fourth-order IMEX additive Runge-Kutta (ARK2) schemes that are susceptible to order reduction. The semi-implicit backward differentiation formulae and IMEX ARK2 schemes are of comparable efficiency. Laminar and turbulent aerodynamic applications require fully implicit schemes, as they         are not profitably partitioned. All schemes achieve design-order convergence rates on the laminar problem. The fourth-order         explicit singly diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (ESDIRK4) scheme is more efficient than the popular second-order backward         differentiation formulae (BDF2) method. The BDF2 and fourth-order modified extended backward differentiation formulae (MEBDF4)         schemes are of comparable efficiency on the turbulent problem. High precision requirements slightly favor the MEBDF4 scheme         (greater than three significant digits). Significant order reduction plagues the ESDIRK4 scheme in the turbulent case. The         magnitude of the order reduction varies with Reynolds number. Poor performance of the high-order methods can partially be         attributed to poor solver performance. Huge time steps allowed by high-order formulations challenge the capabilities of algebraic         solver technology.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>J. C.

This idea is illustrated using a contrived linear test problem and a discretized diffusion problem.         Even though the Euler method can solve these problems if the stepsize is small enough, there is no such limitation for the         implicit Euler method. To obtain high order A-stable methods, it is traditional to turn to Runge-Kutta methods or to linear         multistep methods. Each of these has limitations of one sort or another and we consider, as a middle ground, the use of general         linear (or multivalue multistage) methods. Methods possessing the property of inherent Runge-Kutta stability are identified         as promising methods within this large class, and an example of one of these methods is discussed. The method in question,         even though it has four stages, out-performs the implicit Euler method if sufficient accuracy is required, because of its         higher order.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Lorenzo Pareschi1  | Giovanni Russo2 </authors><title>Implicit-explicit runge-kutta schemes and applications to hyperbolic systems with relaxation      </title><content>We consider new implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta methods for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws with stiff relaxation         terms.

The physical         effects of this fast wave may be important to the system, but resolving the fast time scale may not be required. When simulating         such phenomena one would like to use time steps on the order of the dynamical scale for time integration. Historically, Semi-Implicit         (SI) methods have been developed to step over the stiff wave time scale in a stable fashion. However, SI methods require some         linearization and time splitting, and both of these can produce additional time integration errors. In this paper, the concept         of using SI methods as preconditioners to Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) methods is developed. This algorithmic approach         results in an implicitly balanced method (no linearization or time splitting). In this paper, we provide an overview of SI         methods in a variety of applications, and a brief background on JFNK methods. We will present details of our new algorithmic         approach.

The         scheme is based on a zero-Mach-number formulation of the compressible conservation equations for an ideal gas mixture. It         relies on Strang splitting of the discrete evolution equations, where diffusion is integrated in two half steps that are symmetrically         distributed around a single stiff step for the reaction source terms. The diffusive half-step is integrated using an explicit         single-step, multistage, Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) method. The resulting construction is second-order convergent, and has         superior efficiency due to the extended real-stability region of the RKC scheme. Two additional efficiency-enhancements are         also explored, based on an extrapolation procedure for the transport coefficients and on the use of approximate Jacobian data         evaluated on a coarse mesh. We demonstrate the construction in 1D and 2D flames, and examine consequences of splitting errors.

Although the authors&amp;#8217; original motivation was to extend the ghost fluid method         from compressible to incompressible flow, the elliptic nature of incompressible flow quickly quenched the idea that ghost         cells could be defined and used in the usual manner. Instead the boundary conditions had to be implicitly captured by the         matrix formulation itself, leading to the novel approach. We first review the work on the variable coefficient Poisson equation,         noting that the simplicity of the method allowed for an elegant convergence proof. Simplicity and robustness also allowed         for a quick extension to three-dimensional two-phase incompressible flows including the effects of viscosity and surface tension,         which is discussed subsequently. The method has enjoyed popularity in both computational physics and computer graphics, and         we show some comparisons with the traditional delta function approach for the visual simulation of bubbles.

This paper is about time staggering. Our aim is to assess a fourth-order, explicit, time-staggered integration method from         the literature, through a comparison with two alternative fourth-order, explicit methods. These are the classical Runge-Kutta         method and a symmetric-composition method derived from symplectic Euler.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Peter Diener1| 2 | Ernst Nils Dorb|1| 2 | Erik Schnetter2| 3  | Manuel Tiglio1| 2 </authors><title>Optimized High-Order Derivative and Dissipation Operators Satisfying Summation by Parts, and Applications in Three-dimensional         Multi-block Evolutions      </title><content>We construct optimized high-order finite differencing operators which satisfy summation by parts. Since these operators are         not uniquely defined, we consider several optimization criteria: minimizing the bandwidth, the truncation error on the boundary         points, the spectral radius, or a combination of these. We examine in detail a set of operators that are up to tenth order         accurate in the interior, and we surprisingly find that a combination of these optimizations can improve the operators&amp;#8217; spectral         radius and accuracy by orders of magnitude in certain cases. We also construct high-order dissipation operators that are compatible         with these new finite difference operators and which are semi-definite with respect to the appropriate summation by parts         scalar product. We test the stability and accuracy of these new difference and dissipation operators by evolving a three-dimensional         scalar wave equation on a spherical domain consisting of seven blocks, each discretized with a structured grid, and connected         through penalty boundary conditions. In particular, we find that the constructed dissipation operators are effective in suppressing         instabilities that are sometimes otherwise present in the restricted full norm case.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Youngsoo Ha1  | Carl L.

The value         function of an option contract is known to satisfy a partial differential variational inequality (PDVI) when early exercise         is permitted. We develop a computational method for the valuation of multi-asset American-style options based on approximating         the PDVI by a non-linear penalized PDE with a penalty term with continuous Jacobian. We convert the non-linear PDE to a variational         (weak) form, discretize the weak formulation spatially by a Galerkin finite element method to obtain a system of ODEs, and         integrate the resulting system of ODEs in time with an adaptive variable order and variable step size solver SUNDIALS. Numerical         results demonstrate that employing a penalty term with continuous Jacobian in contrast to the penalty terms with discontinuous         Jacobians in use in the literature improves computational performance of the adaptive temporal integrator. In our framework         we are able to price American-style options with payoffs dependent on up to six assets on a;PC. This is in contrast to the         existing literature on the pricing of American options by PDE methods, that has so far been limited to at most three-dimensional         problems. Our results open avenues for further applications to multi-dimensional problems, such as pricing convertible bonds         in multi-factor models, that will be explored in future work.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Antoine du ChГ©nГ©1| 2| Chohong Min3 | FrГ©dГ©ric Gibou4 </authors><title>Second-Order Accurate Computation of Curvatures in a Level Set Framework Using Novel High-Order Reinitialization Schemes      </title><content>         We present a high-order accurate scheme for the reinitialization equation of Sussman et;al.(J.

However, rigorous         analysis of the actual versus theoretical error properties of these non-linear numerical methods is difficult. We use a bandwidth-optimized         WENO scheme to conduct direct numerical simulations of two- and three-dimensional decaying isotropic turbulence, and we evaluate         the performance of quantitative indicators of local WENO adaptation behavior within the resulting flow fields. One aspect         of this assessment is the demarcation of shock-containing and smooth regions where the WENO method should, respectively, engage         its adaptation mechanism and revert to its linear optimal stencil.

While the advanced level set schemes combine both efficiency and accuracy, their implementation complexity makes it         difficult for the community to reproduce new results and make quantitative comparisons between methods. This paper describes         the Toolbox of Level Set Methods, a collection of Matlab routines implementing the basic level set algorithms on fixed Cartesian grids for rectangular domains in arbitrary dimension.         The Toolbox&amp;#8217;s code and interface are designed to permit flexible combinations of different schemes and PDE forms, allow easy         extension through the addition of new algorithms, and achieve efficient execution despite the fact that the code is entirely         written as m-files.

In this study we develop a novel, computationally         efficient method for generating triangulations in computational space, which, under parametric mapping, are of high geometric         quality. Computational efficiency is maintained over parametric orders (p) through approximating the parametric surface by a grid of simplified vector functions. Unlike other length metric approximations,         a maximum bound on the error introduced to the calculation of lengths by this approximation is defined to ensure the fidelity         of the transformation. This technique is applied to three parametric functions which demonstrate its robustness in handling         high mesh distortions, singularities, and high order surfaces. Further, three complex high-order biological finite element         meshes are triangulated. High mesh quality and a linear relationship between triangle generation and CPU time is observed         for each of these meshes.               </content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>G.

The best fit is defined by the minimum of a quadratic cost function and dynamics are enforced through the use of a penalty term. When the coefficient of the penalty term is identified as the inverse of the variance of model error, the method yields the same results as Kalman filtering, and in the limit of infinitely large coefficient, the same as strong-constraint formalisms. The self-adjoint nature of the equations for the best fit motivated the use of a relaxation method for their solution. The method is illustrated within the context of one-dimensional, linear, shallow-water wave dynamics, where computational examples indicate that a synoptic state is properly determined only if the asynoptic data are equivalent to complete initial conditions.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Peter Monk1  | Gerard R.

The main idea of these methods is to use a splitting of the solution         in order to model the equation. According to the splitting of the solution, a splitting of the equation is obtained. The modeling         principle is to freeze terms which have a small time variation. In this work we use wavelet discretizations of the 2-D Burgers         equations and compare the results with the hierarchical finite elements method. The numerical tests indicate that wavelets         give better results than finite elements      </content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Douglas N. Arnold1 | Franco Brezzi2  | L.

Classical solutions have a running time proportional toN2d, whereN is the size of the spatial grid andd is the space dimension. The new algorithm has a running timeO((N log2N)d). A general application of this algorithm is to the weak solutions of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws as considered by Lax (1973,Hyperbolic Systems of Conservation Laws and the Mathematical Theory of Shock Waves, S.I.A.M.).

Each iteration of the monotone method involves         the solution of a linear equation in an exterior domain with an arbitrary interior boundary. A fast immersed interface method         for generalized Helmholtz equations on exterior irregular domains is used to solve the linear equation. The monotone iterative         method leads to a sequence which converges monotonically from either above or below to a unique solution of the problem. This         monotone convergence guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a solution as well as the convergence of the finite difference         solution to the continuous solution. A comparison of the numerical results against the exact solution in an example indicates         that our method is second order accurate. We also compare our results with available data in the literature to validate the         numerical method. Our method is efficient in terms of accuracy, speed, and flexibility in dealing with the geometry of the         domain      </content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Sauro Succi1 | Maurizio Benassi1</authors><title>A four-color parallel algorithm for the solution of a two-dimensional advection-diffusion equation with the finite element method</title><content>Reordering schemes associated with multicoloring and domain decomposition techniques have been introduced in recent years to obtain parallel and/or vectorized versions of recursive linear solvers such as the Gauss-Seidel SOR scheme (Ortega and Voigt, 1986; White, 1989).

The idea is to realize the solution as well as its gradient as the common zero level         set of several level set functions in the jet space. A very generic level set equation for the underlying PDEs is thus derived.         Specific forms of the level set equation for both first-order transport equations and first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations         are presented. Using a local level set approach, the multi-valued solutions can be realized numerically as the projection         of single-valued solutions of a linear equation in the augmented phase space. The level set approach we use automatically         handles these solutions as they appear      </content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Th. Tsangaris1 | Y. -S. Smyrlis1  | A.

For linear systems, the method consists of forming a small (5&amp;#x2013;15-term) Krylov space using the Jacobian of the system and carrying out exact exponential propagation within this space. Nonlinear corrections are incorporated via a convolution integral formalism; the integral is evaluated via approximate Krylov methods as well. Gains in efficiency ranging from factors of 2 to 30 are demonstrated for several test problems as compared to a forward Euler scheme and to the integration package LSODE.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Scot Adams1  | Bernardo Cockburn1 </authors><title>A Mixed Finite Element Method for Elasticity in Three Dimensions      </title><content>We describe a stable mixed finite element method for linear elasticity in three dimensions.      </content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>I.

The properties of this system, which is perhaps the simplest model for rapidly flowing granular materials, are markedly different from those known for atomic or moleclar gases, in which collisions are of elastic nature. The most prominent feature characterizing granular systems, even in the idealized situation in which no external forcing exists and the initial condition is statistically homogeneous, is their inherent instability to inhomogeneous fluctuations. Granular gases are thus generically nonuniform, a fact that suggests extreme caution in pursuing direct analogies with molecular gases. We find that once an inhomogeneous state sets in, the velocity distribution functions differ from the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Other characteristics of the system are different from their counterparts in molecular systems as well. For a given value of the coefficient of restitution,e, a granular system forms clusters of typical separationL0l/(1-e2)1/2, wherel is the mean free path in the corresponding homogeneous system. Most of the fluctuating kinetic energy then resides in the relatively dilute regions that surround the clusters. Systems whose linear dimensions are less thenL0 do not give rise to clusters; still they are inhomogeneous, the scale of the corresponding inhomogeneity being the longest wavelength allowed by the system's size. The present article is devoted to a detailed numerical study of the above-mentioned clustering phenomenon in two dimensions and in the absence of external forcing. A theoretical framework explaining this phenomenon is outlined. Some general implications as well as practical ramifications are discussed.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Anotida Madzvamuse1 | Philip K. Maini2 | Andrew J.

N. Gupta1| M. Zubair1 | C. E. Grosch1</authors><title>A multigrid algorithm for parallel computers: CPMG</title><content>In this article, we present a multigrid algorithm for parallel computers, the chopped parallel multigrid (CPMG) algorithm. The CPMG algorithm improves the processor utilization by reducing the work load on coarse grids without affecting the convergence rate of the algorithm. This is in contrast to earlier approaches (Gannon and van Rosendale, 1986; Frederickson and McBryan, 1989), where unutilized processors are used to improve the convergence rate. The CPMG algorithm reduces the coarse grid work bychopping the alternate cycles of multigrid. Using analytical results and simulations on sequential machines we show that the CPMG can achieve almost the same convergence rate as standard MG for many cases. Analytically we show that the advantage gained by CPMG over standard MG on a mesh connected massively parallel machine is 33% in hardware utilization, 50% in communication overheads and 38% in overall execution time. We have also evaluated the performance of CPMG on an actual massively parallel machine, the DAP-510. The advantage gained by CPMG over standard MG is 35% in overall execution time. Moreover, the CPMG can be integrated with other parallel multigrid algorithms, such as the PSMG algorithm (Frederickson and McBryan, 1989) and Decker's algorithm (Decker, 1990).</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Yih Nen Jeng1 | Yuan Chang Liou1</authors><title>A new adaptive grid generation by elliptic equations with orthogonality at all of the boundaries</title><content>A new adaptive grid generation procedure is proposed, which combines a previously developed method that used Anderson's adaptive grid scheme along with a method for controlling grid spacing and orthogonality on all of the boundaries. The proposed method assigns the desired grid stretching over the smooth region during initial grid system generation and before grid adaptation is performed. After properly interpreting the smoothing term of the weighting function, the desired grid stretching is added to the adaptive grid scheme.

Numerical experiments indicate, for a fixed total number of collocation points, a significant degradation of spectral accuracy as the number of subdomains increases. While the technique generally yields reasonably good solution, a compromise between accuracy and geometric flexibility must be realized.</title><content/></document></documents>
