This paper investigates how an industrial mobile robot can respond to unexpected static obstacles while following a path planned by a global path planner. The obstacle avoidance problem is formulated using decision theory to determine an optimal response based on inaccurate sensor data. The optimal decision rule minimises the Bayes risk by trading between a sidestep maneuver and backtracking to follow an alternative path. Real-time implementation is emphasised here as part of a framework for real world applications. It has been successfully implemented both in simulation and in reality using a mobile robot.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Miguel Angel Sotelo | Francisco Javier Rodriguez | Luis Magdalena | Luis Miguel Bergasa  | Luciano Boquete </authors><title>A Color Vision-Based Lane Tracking System for Autonomous Driving on Unmarked Roads</title><content>This work describes a color Vision-based System intended to perform stable autonomous driving on unmarked roads. Accordingly, this implies the development of an accurate road surface detection system that ensures vehicle stability. Although this topic has already been documented in the technical literature by different research groups, the vast majority of the already existing Intelligent Transportation Systems are devoted to assisted driving of vehicles on marked extra urban roads and highways. The complete system was tested on the BABIECA prototype vehicle, which was autonomously driven for hundred of kilometers accomplishing different navigation missions on a private circuit that emulates an urban quarter. During the tests, the navigation system demonstrated its robustness with regard to shadows, road texture, and weather and changing illumination conditions.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Anthony Stentz1 | Martial Hebert1</authors><title>A complete navigation system for goal acquisition in unknown environments</title><content>Most autonomous outdoor navigation systems tested on actual robots have centered on local navigation tasks such as avoiding obstacles or following roads. Global navigation has been limited to simple wandering, path tracking, straight-line goal seeking behaviors, or executing a sequence of scripted local behaviors. These capabilities are insufficient for unstructured and unknown environments, where replanning may be needed to account for new information discovered in every sensor image. To address these problems, we have developed a complete system that integrates local and global navigation. The local system uses a scanning laser rangefinder to detect obstacles and recommend steering commands to ensure robot safety. These obstacles are passed to the global system which stores them in a map of the environment. With each addition to the map, the global system uses an incremental path planning algorithm to optimally replan the global path and recommend steering commands to reach the goal. An arbiter combines the steering recommendations to achieve the proper balance between safety and goal acquisition. This system was tested on a real robot and successfully drove it 1.4 kilometers to find a goal given no a priori map of the environment.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Scott McMillan1 | David E.

Through the use of object-oriented mechanisms, a very general yet efficient version of the Articulated-Body (AB) algorithm has been implemented. An efficient solution to branching within chains is developed in the paper so that the algorithm can be used to compute the dynamics for the entire class of open-chain, tree-structured mechanisms. By including compliant contacts with the environment, most closed-chain systems can also be modeled. URV systems with an extended set of topologies can be simulated including proposed underwater walking machines with intra-body powered articulations. Using the encapsulation inherent in C++, the hydrodynamics code has been confined to a single class, thereby explicitly defining this framework and providing an environment for readily implementing desired hydrodynamics algorithms. Resulting simulations are very efficient and can be used in a number of applications both in the development and use of URV systems.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Laci Jalics1 | Hooshang Hemami1 | Bradley Clymer1</authors><title>A Control Strategy for Terrain Adaptive Bipedal Locomotion</title><content>Rhythmic movements of a five-link sagittal biped with muscle-likeactuators are considered.

An accurate dynamic model is important for both controller design and mission simulation, regardless of the control strategy employed. In this paper, a dynamic model for an underwater vehicle with an n-axis robot arm is developed based on Kane's method. The technique provides a direct method for incorporating external environmental forces into the model. The model developed in this paper includes four major hydrodynamic forces: added mass, profile drag, fluid acceleration, and buoyancy. The model derived is a closed form solution which can be utilized in modern model-based control schemes.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Satoshi Kagami1| Tomonobu Kitagawa2| Koichi Nishiwaki2| Tomomichi Sugihara2| Masayuki Inaba2 | Hirochika Inoue2</authors><title>A Fast Dynamically Equilibrated Walking Trajectory Generation Method of Humanoid Robot</title><content>This paper describes a fast dynamically equilibrated trajectory generation method for a humanoid robot. From a given input motion and the desired ZMP trajectory, the algorithm generates a dynamically equilibrated trajectory using the relationship between the robot's center of gravity and the ZMP. Three key issues are denoted: 1) an enhanced ZMP constraint which enables the calculation of robot stability even if several limbs are contacting the environment, 2) a simplified robot model is introduced that represents the relationship between its center of gravity and ZMP, 3) a convergence method is adopted to eliminate approximation errors arising from the simplified model. Combining these three key issues together with online ZMP compensation method, humanoid robot H5 have succeeded to walk, step down and so on. Experimental results using humanoid robot H5 are described.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Stefan Waldherr1| Roseli Romero2 | Sebastian Thrun3</authors><title>A Gesture Based Interface for Human-Robot Interaction</title><content>Service robotics is currently a highly active research area in robotics, with enormous societal potential. Since service robots directly interact with people, finding natural and easy-to-use user interfaces is of fundamental importance. While past work has predominately focussed on issues such as navigation and manipulation, relatively few robotic systems are equipped with flexible user interfaces that permit controlling the robot by natural means. This paper describes a gesture interface for the control of a mobile robot equipped with a manipulator. The interface uses a camera to track a person and recognize gestures involving arm motion. A fast, adaptive tracking algorithm enables the robot to track and follow a person reliably through office environments with changing lighting conditions. Two alternative methods for gesture recognition are compared: a template based approach and a neural network approach. Both are combined with the Viterbi algorithm for the recognition of gestures defined through arm motion (in addition to static arm poses). Results are reported in the context of an interactive clean-up task, where a person guides the robot to specific locations that need to be cleaned and instructs the robot to pick up trash.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Haris Baltzakis1| 2  | Panos Trahanias1| 2 </authors><title>A Hybrid Framework for Mobile Robot Localization: Formulation Using Switching State-Space Models</title><content>In this paper we address one of the most important issues for autonomous mobile robots, namely their ability to localize themselves safely and reliably within their environments. We propose a probabilistic framework for modelling the robot's state and sensory information based on a Switching State-Space Model. The proposed framework generalizes two of the most successful probabilistic model families currently used for this purpose: the Kalman filter Linear models and the Hidden Markov Models. The proposed model combines the advantages of both models, relaxing at the same time inherent assumptions made individually in each of these existing models.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Edward A.

Many of these tasks will involve cooperative efforts by multiple rovers and other agents, adding further requirements both for accuracy and commonality between users. This paper presents a new navigation system called a Self-Calibrating Pseudolite Array (SCPA) that can provide centimeter-level, drift-free localization to multiple rovers within a local area by utilizing GPS-based transceivers deployed in a ground-based array. Such a system of localized beacons can replace or augment a system based on orbiting satellite transmitters, and is capable of fully autonomous operations and calibration. This paper describes the basic principles of navigation using an SCPA, focusing on the critical issue of array self-calibration. The new algorithm presented herein&amp;#x2014;called Quadratic Iterative Least Squares&amp;#x2014;achieves successful self-calibration 99.80% of the time even under extremely adverse conditions. The paper concludes with a description of the experimental prototype developed to demonstrate these capabilities and presents successful results from field trials which validate both the navigation and self-calibration functions of the SCPA.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Michael G.

Its contribution to motor control appears to be due to a fundamental role in dynamical state estimation, which also underlies its role in various non-motor tasks.

Weisbin1</authors><title>A New Method to Evaluate Human-Robot System Performance</title><content>One of the key issues in space exploration is that of deciding what space tasks are best done with humans, with robots, or a suitable combination of each. In general, human and robot skills are complementary. Humans provide as yet unmatched capabilities to perceive, think, and act when faced with anomalies and unforeseen events, but there can be huge potential risks to human safety in getting these benefits. Robots provide complementary skills in being able to work in extremely risky environments, but their ability to perceive, think, and act by themselves is currently not error-free, although these capabilities are continually improving with the emergence of new technologies. Substantial past experience validates these generally qualitative notions. However, there is a need for more rigorously systematic evaluation of human and robot roles, in order to optimize the design and performance of human-robot system architectures using well-defined performance evaluation metrics. This article summarizes a new analytical method to conduct such quantitative evaluations. While the article focuses on evaluating human-robot systems, the method is generally applicable to a much broader class of systems whose performance needs to be evaluated.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Luiz Chaimowicz | Vijay Kumar  | Mario F.

The predictor-corrector scheme provides the desired values of steering parameters which depend on the geometry of the track and a driving criterion. The geometry of the track/road ahead of the vehicle is obtained by extrapolating the identified (estimated) geometry of the track/road traversed during the elapsed time interval. This real-time identification is carried out by fitting a curve to the path traversed by the vehicle. The coordinates of the path are provided by a transformation formulation which makes use of the motion parameters and a kinematic model of the vehicle. The driving criterion specifies the positioning of the AGV on the track. Several possible criteria are identified in the paper and mathematical formulations are presented for one such criterion. Results of off-line calculations using simulated track profiles and experimental data obtained using a prototype AGV while following various track profiles are provided for illustration.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Dieter Fox1 | Wolfram Burgard2 | Hannes Kruppa3  | Sebastian Thrun4 </authors><title>A Probabilistic Approach to Collaborative Multi-Robot Localization</title><content>This paper presents a statistical algorithm for collaborative mobile robot localization. Our approach uses a sample-based version of Markov localization, capable of localizing mobile robots in an any-time fashion. When teams of robots localize themselves in the same environment, probabilistic methods are employed to synchronize each robot's belief whenever one robot detects another. As a result, the robots localize themselves faster, maintain higher accuracy, and high-cost sensors are amortized across multiple robot platforms. The technique has been implemented and tested using two mobile robots equipped with cameras and laser range-finders for detecting other robots. The results, obtained with the real robots and in series of simulation runs, illustrate drastic improvements in localization speed and accuracy when compared to conventional single-robot localization. A further experiment demonstrates that under certain conditions, successful localization is only possible if teams of heterogeneous robots collaborate during localization.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Sebastian Thrun1 | Wolfram Burgard2  | Dieter Fox2</authors><title>A Probabilistic Approach to Concurrent Mapping and Localization for Mobile Robots</title><content>This paper addresses the problem of building large-scale geometric maps of indoor environments with mobile robots.

Harrison1  | Christof Koch1 </authors><title>A Robust Analog VLSI Motion Sensor Based on the Visual System of the Fly</title><content>Sensing visual motion gives a creature valuable information about its interactions with the environment. Flies in particular use visual motion information to navigate through turbulent air, avoid obstacles, and land safely. Mobile robots are ideal candidates for using this sensory modality to enhance their performance, but so far have been limited by the computational expense of processing video. Also, the complex structure of natural visual scenes poses an algorithmic challenge for extracting useful information in a robust manner. We address both issues by creating a small, low-power visual sensor with integrated analog parallel processing to extract motion in real-time. Because our architecture is based on biological motion detectors, we gain the advantages of this highly evolved system: A design that robustly and continuously extracts relevant information from its visual environment. We show that this sensor is suitable for use in the real world, and demonstrate its ability to compensate for an imperfect motor system in the control of an autonomous robot. The sensor attenuates open-loop rotation by a factor of 31 with less than 1 mW power dissipation.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>M. Di Marco | A. Garulli | A.

But, such applications require more than just navigation. To operate in a peopled environment, robots should recognize and act according to human social behavior. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of one such social behavior: a robot that stands in line much as people do. The system employs stereo vision to recognize lines of people, and uses the concept of personal space for modeling the social behavior. Personal space is used both to detect the end of a line and to determine how much space to leave between the robot and the person in front of it. Our model of personal space is based on measurements from people forming lines. We demonstrate our ideas with a mobile robot navigation system that can purchase a cup of coffee, even if people are waiting in line for service.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Angelo M. Sabatini1</authors><title>A statistical estimation method for segmentation of sonar range data</title><content>In this paper, we describe how to deal with an important sensorial activity that ultrasonic echo-locating systems for mobile robot navigation have often to perform, namely the extraction of straight line segments from range data and the accurate localization of the corresponding planar targets. It is commonplace that range data segmentation starts with using least squares interpolation algorithms for obtaining straight line segments: it is our goal to prove that caution must be called for in order to avoid somewhat misleading results. The case study concerns the use of a linear array formed by three ultrasonic transducers in a 2D specular environment composed of line and point acoustic targets.The segmentation algorithm we propose is subdivided into two functionally distinct modules, namely identification and localization. The identification module is based on a sequential hypothesis testing between alternative hypotheses that explain the sonar range data as originated from line or point targets. With regard to the localization module, we demonstrate that widely used approaches to sensor modeling are, to some extent, deceptively simple: the estimation accuracy for the localization of planar objects may be decreased by the inability of some traditional sonar sensor models to take properly into account the specularity of reflections. A physically based model of acoustic range sensors acting in specular environments allows us to design a localization module which is capable of producing accurate and unbiased estimates of the parameters of a planar geometric feature.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>M.

The system supplies six-DOF resistive forces in response to virtual reality-based exercises running on a host PC. The Stewart platform uses double-acting pneumatic cylinders, linear potentiometers as position sensors, and a six-DOF force sensor. The Rutgers Ankle controller contains an embedded Pentium board, pneumatic solenoid valves, valve controllers, and associated signal conditioning electronics. Communication with the host PC is over a standard RS232 line. The platform movement and output forces are transparently recorded by the host PC in a database. This database can be accessed remotely over the Internet. Thus, the Rutgers Ankle Orthopedic Rehabilitation Interface will allow patients to exercise at home while being monitored remotely by therapists. A prototype was constructed, and proof-of-concept trials were conducted at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. The results indicate that the system works well as a diagnostic tool. The subjective evaluation by patients was very positive. Further medical trials are needed before the system clinical efficacy in rehabilitation can be established.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Young D. Kwon1  | Jin S.

Unlike other methods that are based on a set of geometric primitives, the presented method builds a map with a set of obstacle regions. In building a map of the environment, the presented algorithm represents the obstacles with a number of stochastic obstacle regions, each of which is characterized by its own stochastic parameters such as mean and covariance. Whereas the geometric primitives based map sometimes does not fit well to sensor data, the presented method reliably represents various types of obstacles including those of irregular walls and sets of tiny objects. Their shapes and features are easily extracted from the stochastic parameters of their obstacle regions, and are used to develop reliable navigation and obstacle avoidance algorithms. The algorithm updates the world map in real time by detecting the changes of each obstacle region. Consequently, it is adequate for modeling the quasi-static environment, which includes occasional changes in positions of the obstacles rather than constant dynamic moves of the obstacles. The presented map building method has successfully been implemented and tested on the ARES-II mobile robot system equipped with a LADAR 2D-laser range finder.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Anthony Stentz1| Cristian Dima1| Carl Wellington1| Herman Herman1 | David Stager1</authors><title>A System for Semi-Autonomous Tractor Operations</title><content>Tractors are the workhorses of the modern farm. By automating these machines, we can increase the productivity, improve safety, and reduce costs for many agricultural operations. Many researchers have tested computer-controlled machines for farming, but few have investigated the larger issues such as how humans can supervise machines and work amongst them. In this paper, we present a system for tractor automation. A human programs a task by driving the relevant routes. The task is divided into subtasks and assigned to a fleet of tractors that drive portions of the routes. Each tractor uses on-board sensors to detect people, animals, and other vehicles in the path of the machine, stopping for such obstacles until it receives advice from a supervisor over a wireless link. A first version of the system was implemented on a single tractor. Several features of the system were validated, including accurate path tracking, the detection of obstacles based on both geometric and non-geometric properties, and self-monitoring to determine when human intervention is required. Additionally, the complete system was tested in a Florida orange grove, where it autonomously drove seven kilometers.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Gregory Dudek1 | Michael R.

Such an algorithm is necessary for producing mosaicked images of the ocean floor. The basis of this three-dimensional motion planning algorithm is a new planar algorithm for nonsimply connected areas with boundaries of arbitrary shape. We show that this algorithm generalizes naturally to complex three-dimensional environments in which the terrain to be covered is projectively planar. This planar algorithm represents an improvement over previous algorithms because it results in a shorter path length for the robot and does not assume a polygonal environment. The path length of our algorithm is shown to be linear in the size of the area to be covered; the amount of memory required by the robot to implement the algorithm is linear in the size of the description of the boundary of the area. An example is provided that demonstrates the algorithm's performance in a nonsimply connected, nonplanar environment.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Timothy Horiuchi1 | Kai M.

This paper describes a robot learning method which enables a mobile robot to simultaneously acquire the ability to avoid objects, follow walls, seek goals and control its velocity as a result of interacting with the environment without human assistance. The robot acquires these behaviors by learning how fast it should move along predefined trajectories with respect to the current state of the input vector. This enables the robot to perform object avoidance, wall following and goal seeking behaviors by choosing to follow fast trajectories near: the forward direction, the closest object or the goal location respectively. Learning trajectory velocities can be done relatively quickly because the required knowledge can be obtained from the robot's interactions with the environment without incurring the credit assignment problem. We provide experimental results to verify our robot learning method by using a mobile robot to simultaneously acquire all three behaviors.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>J.M.

With this objective in mind, we enhance the existing appearance-based robot localization framework in two directions by exploiting the use of a stereo camera mounted on a pan-and-tilt device. First, we move from the classical passive appearance-based localization framework to an active one where the robot sometimes executes actions with the only purpose of gaining information about its location in the environment. Along this line, we introduce an entropy-based criterion for action selection that can be efficiently evaluated in our probabilistic localization system. The execution of the actions selected using this criterion allows the robot to quickly find out its position in case it gets lost. Secondly, we introduce the use of depth maps obtained with the stereo cameras. The information provided by depth maps is less sensitive to changes of illumination than that provided by plain images. The main drawback of depth maps is that they include missing values: points for which it is not possible to reliably determine depth information. The presence of missing values makes Principal Component Analysis (the standard method used to compress images in the appearance-based framework) unfeasible. We describe a novel Expectation-Maximization algorithm to determine the principal components of a data set including missing values and we apply it to depth maps. The experiments we present show that the combination of the active localization with the use of depth maps gives an efficient and robust appearance-based robot localization system.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>J.

Using an active trinocular stereo head (VIRTUE), sensed 3-D line segments are grouped into a polyhedral volumetric model through the aid of a constrained Delaunay triangulation.

Here we examine how rats use their whiskers (vibrissae) during free exploratory behavior and during a texture discrimination task. Results show that during free exploration, the rat rhythmically moves its head to place its small (micro) vibrissae on the surfaces it is exploring. These periodic microvibrissal placements are temporally synchronized with the whisking movements of the large (macro) vibrissae. The periodic microvibrissal placements occurred even during a texture discrimination task, in which a smooth, continuous movement might have been equally effective at extracting the required information. Finally, it was found that rats may sometimes use their micro and macro vibrissae consecutively, instead of simultaneously. This suggests that, like humans, rats' exploration consists of a series of movement sequences in which increasingly refined information is gathered about an object. Some implications of these results for the design of artificial exploratory systems are discussed.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Shuuji Kajita1  | Kazuo Tani2</authors><title>Adaptive Gait Control of a Biped Robot Based on Realtime Sensing of the Ground Profile</title><content>In this paper, realtime control of dynamic biped locomotion usingsensor information is investigated.

The adaptive optimal control of the differential drive helps to improve the automatic guidance system's safety and comfort taking into consideration operating conditions such as load and distribution changes or motion actuator limitations. Furthermore, the incorporation of an optimal controller to minimize location errors and a fuzzy controller to adapt the linear velocity to the characteristics of the trajectory, provide the vehicle with a high degree of intelligence and autonomy, even when faced with obstacles.

A graphical simulation of the robotic system can be used to improve development, train operators, and enhance their performance during actual operations. This paper summarizes the advantages realized using a graphical simulation to visually display telemetry from a multiple arm space telerobot. By displaying the commanded position of a manipulator graphically along with the actual position, the operator becomes more effective in diagnosing anomalies in the system. The negative impact of communication time delay can also be alleviated using this commanded display. The above advantages coupled with the simulation's ability to display multiple synthetic views, to move each view to any virtual location, and to highlight functions to emphasize important information, can ease the operator's workload, making him or her more effective in controlling a complex system.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Matt Wilson | Chris Melhuish | Ana B.

It provides an alternative to patch sorting for multi-object sorting. Three different mechanisms, based on hypotheses about the behaviour of Leptothorax ants are investigated and comparisons are made. Mechanism I employs a simple clustering algorithm, with objects of different sizes. The mechanism explores the idea that it is the size difference of the object that promotes segregation. Mechanism II is an extension to our earlier two-object segregation mechanism. We test the ability of this mechanism to segregate an increased number of object types. Mechanism III uses a combined leaky integrator, which allows a greater segregation of object types while retaining the compactness of the structure. Its performance is improved by optimizing the mechanism's parameters using a genetic algorithm. We compare the three mechanisms in terms of sorting performance. Comparisons between the results of these sorting mechanisms and the behaviour of ants should facilitate further insights into both biological and robotic research and make a contribution to the further development of swarm robotics.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Haoyong Yu1| Matthew Spenko1 | Steven Dubowsky1 </authors><title>An Adaptive Shared Control System for an Intelligent Mobility Aid for the Elderly</title><content>The control system for a personal aid for mobility and health monitoring (PAMM) for the elderly is presented.

It is proved that from any support pattern satisfying the condition, it is always possible to transform the given support pattern to the support pattern of wave gait.

Coaxial copper and fiber-optic cable proved to be much more reliable than aerial communication links. Aerial communication used with explosive disposal robots allows for possible terrorist interference making cable communication a requirement. The main problem in using a cable is that it has to be carefully paid out and stacked on the winding spool when the vehicle is moving from/towards the operator. Clearly, the cable can not be dragged by the robot since the typical radius of a mobile robot is 200 to 500 m. Therefore, building a winding system capable of performing smooth and neat cable winding and pay-out operation is crucial for the overall robot reliability. Unfortunately, research in the area of mobile robotic systems has traditionally been focused elsewhere. For this reason a winding system was developed conceptually, and a prototype was built. Hundreds of experiments were performed before completing the work. The developed prototype has unique features including: (i) full independence of the robot control/sensorial system, that is, it is autonomous with respect to the vehicle carrying it; (ii) handling different cables without any readjustment of the control system; and (iii) a sophisticated safety system to prevent irregular cable handling. The paper includes the description of the developed prototype, the underlying conceptual ideas, as well as experimental results.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>E.J. van Henten1| J.

A description is given of the working environment of the robot and the logistics of harvesting. It is stated that for a 2 ha Dutch nursery, 4 harvesting robots and one docking station are needed during the peak season. Based on these preliminaries, the design specifications of the harvest robot are defined. The main requirement is that a single harvest operation may take at most 10 s. Then, the paper focuses on the individual hardware and software components of the robot. These include, the autonomous vehicle, the manipulator, the end-effector, the two computer vision systems for detection and 3D imaging of the fruit and the environment and, finally, a control scheme that generates collision-free motions for the manipulator during harvesting. The manipulator has seven degrees-of-freedom (DOF). This is sufficient for the harvesting task. The end-effector is designed such that it handles the soft fruit without loss of quality. The thermal cutting device included in the end-effector prevents the spreading of viruses through the greenhouse. The computer vision system is able to detect more than 95% of the cucumbers in a greenhouse. Using geometric models the ripeness of the cucumbers is determined. A motion planner based on the A*-search algorithm assures collision-free eye-hand co-ordination. In autumn 2001 system integration took place and the harvesting robot was tested in a greenhouse. With a success rate of 80%, field tests confirmed the ability of the robot to pick cucumbers without human interference. On average the robot needed 45 s to pick one cucumber. Future research focuses on hardware and software solutions to improve the picking speed and accuracy of the eye-hand co-ordination of the robot.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Barney Pell1 | Douglas E.

The architecture supports challenging requirements of the autonomous spacecraft domain not usually addressed in mobile robot architectures, including highly reliable autonomous operations over extended time periods in the presence of tight resource constraints, hard deadlines, limited observability, and concurrent activity. A hybrid architecture, NMRA integrates traditional real-time monitoring and control with heterogeneous components for constraint-based planning and scheduling, robust multi-threaded execution, and model-based diagnosis and reconfiguration. Novel features of this integrated architecture include support for robust closed-loop generation and execution of concurrent temporal plans and a hybrid procedural/deductive executive.We implemented a prototype autonomous spacecraft agent within the architecture and successfully demonstrated the prototype in the context of a challenging autonomous mission scenario on a simulated spacecraft. As a result of this success, the integrated architecture has been selected to fly as an autonomy experiment on Deep Space One (DS-1), the first flight of NASA';s New Millennium Program (NMP), which will launch in 1998.

KR-II is a real robot, composed of six cylindrical segments linked in series and has a long snake-like appearance. The main issue on KR-II's steering control is, given from a remote human operator the velocity and orientation commands for the foremost segment, to automatically generate joint commands for all the following segments, such that they follow the foremost segment's trajectory. The derived method is based on a trajectory planning scheme in the inertial reference frame, and is feasible for real time computation. It also presents good energy efficiency and trajectory tracking performance characteristics, and can be extended for KR-II's W-Shaped Configuration steering control, which augments the lateral stability of the robot, essential for locomotion over uneven terrain. The validity of these methods are verified by experiments on the mechanical model KR-II.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Bradley J. Nelson1 | Pradeep K.

This paper describes a distributed framework for assimilating the disparate feedback provided by force and vision sensors, including active vision sensors, for robotic manipulation systems. The main components of the expectation-based framework include object schemas and port-based agents. Object schemas represent the manipulation task internally in terms of geometric models with attached sensor mappings. Object schemas are dynamically updated by sensor feedback, and thus provide an ability to perform three dimensional spatial reasoning during task execution. Because object schemas possess knowledge of sensor mappings, they are able to both select appropriate sensors and guide active sensors based on task characteristics. Port-based agents are the executors of reference inputs provided by object schemas and are defined in terms of encapsulated control strategies. Experimental results demonstrate the capabilities of the framework in two ways: the performance of manipulation tasks with active camera-lens systems, and the assimilation of force and vision sensory feedback.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Ryo Kurazume1  | Shigeo Hirose2</authors><title>An Experimental Study of a Cooperative Positioning System</title><content>Several position identification methods are being used for mobile robots. Dead reckoning is a popular method but due to the error accumulation from wheel slippage, its reliability is low for measurement of long distances especially on uneven surfaces. Another popular method is the landmark method, which estimates current position relative to known landmarks, but the landmark method''s limitation is that it cannot be used in an uncharted environment. Thus, this paper proposes a new method called Cooperative Positioning System (CPS) that is able to overcome these shortcomings. The main concept of CPS is to divide the robots into two groups, A and B where group A remains stationary and acts as a landmark while group B moves and then group B stops and acts as a landmark for group A. This process is repeated until the target position is reached. Compared with dead reckoning, CPS has a far lower accumulation of positioning errors, and can also work in three dimensions. Furthermore, CPS employs inherent landmarks and therefore can be used in uncharted environments unlike the landmark method. In this paper, we introduce the basic concept of CPS and its positioning principle. Next, we outline a second prototype CPS machine model (CPS-II) and discuss the method of position estimation using the variance of positioning error and weighted least squares method. Position identification experiments using the CPS-II model give a positioning accuracy of 0.12% for position and 0.32 degree for attitude after the robots traveled a distance of 21.5 m.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Christopher Assad1 </authors><title>An Hypothesis for a Novel Learning Mechanism in the Cerebellar Cortex</title><content>The cerebellar cortical circuitry may support a distinct second form of associative learning, complementary to the well-known synaptic plasticity (long term depression, LTD) that has been previously shown. As the granule cell axons ascend to the molecular layer, they make multiple synapses on the overlying Purkinje cells (PC). This ascending branch (AB) input, which has been ignored in models of cerebellar learning, is likely to be functionally distinct from the parallel fiber (PF) synaptic input. We predict that AB-PF correlations lead to Hebbian-type learning at the PF-PC synapse, including long term potentiation (LTP), and allowing the cortical circuit to combine AB-PF LTP for feedforward state prediction with climbing fiber LTD for feedback error correction. The new learning mechanism could therefore add computational capacity to cerebellar models and may explain more of the experimental data.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Andrew Howard1| Maja J. Matari1 | Gaurav S. Sukhatme1</authors><title>An Incremental Self-Deployment Algorithm for Mobile Sensor Networks</title><content>This paper describes an incremental deployment algorithm for mobile sensor networks. A mobile sensor network is a distributed collection of nodes, each of which has sensing, computation, communication and locomotion capabilities. The algorithm described in this paper will deploy such nodes one-at-a-time into an unknown environment, with each node making use of information gathered by previously deployed nodes to determine its deployment location. The algorithm is designed to maximize network coverage while simultaneously ensuring that nodes retain line-of-sight relationships with one another. This latter constraint arises from the need to localize the nodes in an unknown environment: in our previous work on team localization (A. Howard, M.J. Matari, and G.S. Sukhatme, in Proceedings of the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, EPFL, Switzerland, 2002; IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 2002) we have shown how nodes can localize themselves by using other nodes as landmarks. This paper describes the incremental deployment algorithm and presents the results from an extensive series of simulation experiments. These experiments serve to both validate the algorithm and illuminate its empirical properties.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>George A.

This method is a part of a larger research project aimed at modeling motor control and imitation using the notion of perceptuo-motor primitives, a basis set of coupled perceptual and motor routines. In our model, the perceptual system is biased by the set of motor behaviors the agent can execute. Thus, an agent can automatically classify observed movements into its executable repertoire. In this paper, we describe a method for automatically deriving a set of primitives directly from human movement data.We used movement data gathered from a psychophysical experiment on human imitation to derive the primitives. The data were first filtered, then segmented, and principal component analysis was applied to the segments. The eigenvectors corresponding to a few of the highest eigenvalues provide us with a basis set of primitives. These are used, through superposition and sequencing, to reconstruct the training movements as well as novel ones. The validation of the method was performed on a humanoid simulation with physical dynamics. The effectiveness of the motion reconstruction was measured through an error metric. We also explored and evaluated a technique of clustering in the space of primitives for generating controllers for executing frequently used movements.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>B.

Along these lines, the authors constructed a platform, on the base of a commercial industrial truck, provided with sufficient autonomy to carry out tasks within an industrial environment (VIA: Autonomous Industrial Vehicle).One of the sensor systems used in the truck is a system of artificial vision which enables it to move on asphalted surfaces both in open environments (roads) and closed ones, seeking the markings which most easily allow it to determine the path marked in the images. The system for following roads is capable of following painted lines, determining the sides of the road by texture analysis or determining the minimum width of the road for the robot to pass, according to the circumstances. A model of the road predicts its situation and enables a decision to be made on whether the information provided by the algorithm is reliable or not. At the same time, a neural network is trained with the results obtained by any of the previous algorithms, in such a way that when the training process converges the network takes over the steering of the truck.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Barry Brumitt1| Anthony Stentz1| Martial Hebert1 | CMU UGV Group1</authors><title>Autonomous Driving with Concurrent Goals and Multiple Vehicles: Experiments and Mobility Components</title><content>In this paper, we describe a complete system for mission planning and execution for multiple robots in natural terrain.

Since the manual cleaning is tedious and boring there is an interest in automating the task. This paper presents methods for autonomous localization and navigation for a pool cleaner to enable full coverage of pools. Path following cannot be ensured through use of internal position estimation methods alone; therefore sensing is needed. Sensor based estimation enable automatic correction of slippage. For this application we use ultrasonic sonars. Based on an analysis of the overall task and performance of the system a strategy for cleaning/navigation is developed. For the automatic localization a Kalman filtering technique is proposed: the Kalman filter uses sonar measurements and a dynamic model of the robot to provide estimates of the pose of the pool cleaner. Using this localization method we derive an optimal control strategy for traversal of a pool. The system has been implemented and successfully tested on the WEDAB400 pool cleaner.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>D. B. Marco1| A. J. Healey1 | R. B.

An overview of some of the missions being considered for this rapidly developing technology is mentioned including environmental monitoring, underwater inspection, geological survey as well as military missions in mine countermeasures.The functionalities required of such vehicles and their relation to intelligent control technology is discussed. In particular, the use of Prolog as a computer language for the specification of the discrete event system (DES) aspects of the mission control is proposed. The connections between a Prolog specification and the more common Petri Net graphical representation of a DES are made. Links are made between activation commands, transitioning signals, and the continuous state dynamic control system (DCS) responsible for vehicle stabilization.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>K.

Visual and motor interactions are described within this generic framework that allows for an incremental development of behavior from an initial basis set. Basic locomotion agents as, Stop&amp;amp;Backward, Avoid, and Forward are implemented by means of fuzzy knowledge bases to deal with the uncertainty and imprecision inherent to real systems and environments. Basic visual agents as, Saccadic, Find_Contour, and Center are raised under a space-variant representation pursuing an anthropomorphic approach. We illustrate how a complex behavior results from the combination of lower level agents always connected to the basic motor agents. The proposed methodology is validated on a caterpillar mobile robot in navigation tasks directed by an object description.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Olivier Lebeltel| Pierre Bessi&amp;egrave re | Julien Diard | Emmanuel Mazer</authors><title>Bayesian Robot Programming</title><content>We propose a new method to program robots based on Bayesian inference and learning. It is called BRP for Bayesian Robot Programming. The capacities of this programming method are demonstrated through a succession of increasingly complex experiments. Starting from the learning of simple reactive behaviors, we present instances of behavior combination, sensor fusion, hierarchical behavior composition, situation recognition and temporal sequencing. This series of experiments comprises the steps in the incremental development of a complex robot program. The advantages and drawbacks of BRP are discussed along with these different experiments and summed up as a conclusion. These different robotics programs may be seen as an illustration of probabilistic programming applicable whenever one must deal with problems based on uncertain or incomplete knowledge. The scope of possible applications is obviously much broader than robotics.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Blake Hannaford1| Kristen Jaax1 | Glenn Klute1</authors><title>Bio-Inspired Actuation and Sensing</title><content>The superb ability of animals to negotiate rough terrain has caused engineers to focus on mechanical properties of muscle and other unique features in order to design improved robots for exploration. This paper reviews recent work in artificial muscle actuators, as well as a new sensor based on a robotic model of the muscle spindle cell. The actuator contains a pneumatic force generator in parallel with a non-linear damping element and in series with a non-linear elastic tendon. Work loop experiments were performed to characterize this actuator under conditions similar to real locomotion at different speeds. The robotic muscle spindle is an 8 &amp;times; 1 cm device which simulates the response of the physiological muscle spindle to stretch.

In this research, a robotic arm composed of multiple identical segments in a collective computational architecture was tested for its ability to produce adaptive pointing and reaching behavior. The movement rules for these robotic arm segments were derived from reflex arc principles in the human nervous system. These arm segments received no central directions and used no direct informational exchange, but rather the arm was sensor-driven at its leading segment in a way that maximized pointing accuracy of the arm. The remaining non-leading segments in the arm were moved in a sequential order using only sensed locally-available movement information about neighboring segments.Pointing and reaching behavior was observed in experiments with and without obstacles to movement. Because such behavior was not specified within each segment, the overall limb behavior emerged due to the interaction and coordination of all segments, rather than due to any single segment, centrally controlled influence, or explicit inter-segmental method of communication.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Keon Young Yi1 | Yuan F.

Ankles of human beings have small torque and are veryflexible within a certain range of motion (very stiff near and beyondthis range). This characteristic makes foot landing soft and gives agood contact between its sole and the ground. This feature can beimplemented in a biped robot by using a small actuator for the anklejoints. A small actuator consumes less energy and reduces the weightof the leg. With less power in the ankle joints, robot walkingbecomes more difficult to control. This problem can be solved byproviding a feedback control mechanism as presented in this paper. Thecontrol mechanism uses the motion of the body and the swinging leg toeliminate instability caused by the weak ankle. Two locomotionexamples, standing and walking, were investigated respectively toshow the validity of the proposed control scheme. In standing, thecontrol input is the displacement of the ankle joint of thesupporting leg. The control mechanism decides the bending angle ofthe body and the position of the swinging leg. For walking, only thebending angle of the body is used to avoid the discontinuity of thecontrol input. Experimental results are presented to show theeffectiveness of the control mechanism.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>M. Caccia1 | G. Bruzzone1  | G.

In the framework of hierarchical control architectures able to uncouple the robot's kinematics (guidance) and dynamics (velocity control), the task of bottom-following is accomplished by suitable guidance task functions, which enable the system to handle unmodeled, i.e., not measured or estimated, kinematics interactions between the robot and the operating environment. In order to increase the bottom followers' reliability, the paper discusses possible techniques for modeling and handling the environmental and measurement uncertainty in the estimate of the local interactions between the vehicle and the operating environment, i.e., altitude and bottom slope. In particular, according to at-sea operational experience, the problem of managing dropouts due to erroneous tracking of multi-path echoes by the ROV altimeter(s) is addressed. Results of a large set of pool trials carried out with the Romeo ROV are reported and discussed.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Rodney A.

We, on the other hand, study robots that leave trails in the terrain to cover closed terrain repeatedly. How to design such ant robots has so far been studied only theoretically for gross robot simplifications. In this article, we describe for the first time how to build physical ant robots that cover terrain and test their design both in realistic simulation environments and on a Pebbles III robot. We show that the coverage behavior of our ant robots can be modeled with a modified version of node counting, a real-time search method. We then report on first experiments that we performed to understand their efficiency and robustness in situations where some ant robots fail, they are moved without realizing this, the trails are of uneven quality, and some trails are destroyed. Finally, we report the results of a large-scale simulation experiment where ten ant robots covered a factory floor of 25 by 25 meters repeatedly over 85 hours without getting stuck.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Call for Papers</authors><title/></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Ruben Martinez-Cantin1 | N|o de Freitas2 | Eric Brochu2 | JosГ© Castellanos3 | Arnaud Doucet2 </authors><title>A Bayesian exploration-exploitation approach for optimal online sensing and planning with a visually guided mobile robot      </title><content>We address the problem of online path planning for optimal sensing with a mobile robot. The objective of the robot is to learn         the most about its pose and the environment given time constraints. We use a POMDP with a utility function that depends on         the belief state to model the finite horizon planning problem. We replan as the robot progresses throughout the environment.         The POMDP is high-dimensional, continuous, non-differentiable, nonlinear, non-Gaussian and must be solved in real-time. Most         existing techniques for stochastic planning and reinforcement learning are therefore inapplicable. To solve this extremely         complex problem, we propose a Bayesian optimization method that dynamically trades off exploration (minimizing uncertainty         in unknown parts of the policy space) and exploitation (capitalizing on the current best solution). We demonstrate our approach         with a visually-guide mobile robot. The solution proposed here is also applicable to other closely-related domains, including         active vision, sequential experimental design, dynamic sensing and calibration with mobile sensors.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>V.

The         computational process of relaxation in the attractor landscape is similar to coordinating the movements of a puppet by means         of attached strings, the strings in our case being the virtual force fields generated by the intended/attended goal and the         other task dependent combinations of constraints involved in the execution of the task. Hence the name PMP (Passive Motion         Paradigm) was given to the computational model. The method does not require explicit kinematic inversion and the computational         mechanism does not crash near kinematic singularities or when the robot is asked to achieve a final pose that is outside its         intrinsic workspace: what happens, in this case, is the gentle degradation of performance that characterizes humans in the same situations. Further, the measure of inconsistency in the relaxation         in such cases can be directly used to trigger higher level reasoning in terms of breaking the goal into a sequence of subgoals         directed towards searching and perhaps using tools to realize the otherwise unrealizable goal. The basic PMP model has been         further expanded in the present paper by means of (1);a;non-linear dynamical timing mechanism that provides terminal attractor         properties to the relaxation process and (2);branching units that allow to &amp;#8216;compose&amp;#8217; complex PMP-networks to coordinate multiple         kinematic chains in a complex structure, including manipulated tools.

The inspiration for the definition is the commonly-held notion of stable walking: the biped does not fall. Somewhat more formally,         biped walking is shown to be stable if the trajectory of each step places the robot in a state at the end of the step for         which a controller is known to exist that generates a trajectory for the next step with this same property. To make the definition         useful, an algorithm is given to verify if a given controller induces stable walking in the given sense. Also given is a framework         to synthesize controllers that induce stable walking. The results are illustrated on a 5-link biped ERNIE in simulation and         experiment.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Ingmar Posner1 | Mark Cummins1  | Paul Newman1 </authors><title>A generative framework for fast urban labeling using spatial and;temporal context      </title><content>This paper introduces a multi-level classification framework for the semantic annotation of urban maps as provided by a mobile         robot. Environmental cues are considered for classification at different scales. The first stage considers local scene properties         using a probabilistic bag-of-words classifier. The second stage incorporates contextual information across a given scene (spatial         context) and across several consecutive scenes (temporal context) via a Markov Random Field (MRF). Our approach is driven         by data from an onboard camera and 3D;laser scanner and uses a combination of visual and geometric features. By framing the         classification exercise probabilistically we take advantage of an information-theoretic bail-out policy when evaluating class-conditional         likelihoods. This efficiency, combined with low order MRFs resulting from our two-stage approach, allows us to generate scene         labels at speeds suitable for online deployment. We demonstrate the virtue of considering such spatial and temporal context         during the classification task and analyze the performance of our technique on data gathered over almost 17;km of track through         a city.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Ashish D.

In this context, we present a method called the &amp;#8216;P-robot Method&amp;#8217; under which we introduce entities called         the p-robots at the environmental contact points and treat the linked mobile robots as a multiple degree-of-freedom object, comprising         an articulated open kinematic chain, which is manipulated by the p-robots. The method is suitable to address three critical aspects of physical cooperation: a) analysis of environmental contacts,         b) utilization of redundancy, and c) exploitation of system dynamics. Dynamics of the open chain are computed independent         of the constraints, thus allowing the same set of equations to be used as the constraint conditions change, and simplifying         the addition of multiple robots to the chain. The decoupling achieved through constraining the p-robots facilitates the analysis of kinematic as well as force constraints. We introduce the idea of a &amp;#8216;tipping cone&amp;#8217;, similar to         a standard friction cone, to test whether forces on the robots cause undesired tipping. We have employed the P-robot Method         for the static as well as dynamic analysis for a cooperative behavior involving two robots. The method is generalizable to         analyze cooperative behaviors with any number of robots. We demonstrate that redundant actuation achieved by an adding a third         robot to cooperation can help in satisfying the contact constraints. The P-robot Method can be useful to analyze other interesting         multi-body robotic systems as well.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Matthew Howard1 | Stefan Klanke1| Michael Gienger2| Christian Goerick2 | Sethu Vijayakumar1</authors><title>A novel method for learning policies from variable constraint data      </title><content>Many everyday human skills can be framed in terms of performing some task subject to constraints imposed by the environment.

A key issue is the clustering of time-series data collected by the sensors of a ground-based vehicle moving over         several terrain surfaces (e.g. concrete or soil). In this context, we present a novel off-line windowless clustering algorithm         that exploits time-dependency between samples. In terrain coverage, sets of sensory measurements are returned that are spatially,         and hence temporally, correlated. Our algorithm works by finding a set of parameter values for a user-specified classifier         that minimize a cost function. This cost function is related to the change in classifier probability estimates over time.         The main advantage over other existing methods is its ability to cluster data for fast-switching systems that either have         high process or observation noise, or complex distributions that cannot be properly characterized within the time interval         that the system stays in a single state. The algorithm was evaluated using three different classifiers (linear separator,         mixture of Gaussians and k-Nearest Neighbor), over both synthetic data sets and two different mobile robotic platforms, with success. Comparisons are         provided against a window-based algorithm and against a hidden Markov model trained with Expectation-Maximization, with positive         results.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Charles W.

This article focuses on texture classification using artificial whiskers and addresses a limitation of previous studies, namely,         their use of whisker deflection signals obtained under relatively constrained experimental conditions. Here we consider the         classification of signals obtained from a whiskered robot required to explore different surface textures from a range of orientations         and distances. This procedure resulted in a variety of deflection signals for any given texture. Using a standard Gaussian         classifier we show, using both hand-picked features and ones derived from studies of rat vibrissal processing, that a robust         rough-smooth discrimination is achievable without any knowledge of how the whisker interacts with the investigated object.

Key components of each         Bayes filter are probabilistic prediction and observation models. This paper shows how non-parametric Gaussian process (GP)         regression can be used for learning such models from training data. We also show how Gaussian process models can be integrated         into different versions of Bayes filters, namely particle filters and extended and unscented Kalman filters. The resulting         GP-BayesFilters can have several advantages over standard (parametric) filters. Most importantly, GP-BayesFilters do not require         an accurate, parametric model of the system. Given enough training data, they enable improved tracking accuracy compared to         parametric models, and they degrade gracefully with increased model uncertainty. These advantages stem from the fact that         GPs consider both the noise in the system and the uncertainty in the model. If an approximate parametric model is available,         it can be incorporated into the GP, resulting in further performance improvements. In experiments, we show different properties         of GP-BayesFilters using data collected with an autonomous micro-blimp as well as synthetic data.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>JosГ© Neira1  | Jeff Trinkle2 </authors><title>Guest editorial: selected papers from Robotics: Science;and;Systems;2008      </title><content>Without Abstract</content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Jan Peters1  | Andrew Y.

To build models of         gas distributions that can be used to accurately predict the gas concentration at query locations is a challenging task due         to the chaotic nature of gas dispersal. We formulate this task as a regression problem. To deal with the specific properties         of gas distributions, we propose a sparse Gaussian process mixture model, which allows us to accurately represent the smooth         background signal and the areas with patches of high concentrations. We furthermore integrate the sparsification of the training         data into an EM procedure that we apply for learning the mixture components and the gating function. Our approach has been         implemented and tested using datasets recorded with a real mobile robot equipped with an electronic nose.

We adopt the probabilistic model         for model-free RL of Vlassis and Toussaint (Proceedings of the international conference on machine learning, Montreal, Canada,         2009), and we propose a Monte Carlo EM algorithm (MCEM) for control learning that searches directly in the space of controller         parameters using information obtained from randomly generated robot trajectories. MCEM is related to, and generalizes, the         PoWER algorithm of Kober and Peters (Proceedings of the neural information processing systems, 2009). In the finite-horizon case MCEM reduces precisely to PoWER, but MCEM can also handle the discounted infinite-horizon case.         An interesting result is that the infinite-horizon case can be viewed as a &amp;#8216;randomized&amp;#8217; version of the finite-horizon case,         in the sense that the length of each sampled trajectory is a random draw from an appropriately constructed geometric distribution.

While it is often easy to abstractly define or even demonstrate a desired         behavior, designing a controller that embodies the same behavior is difficult, time consuming, and ultimately expensive. The         machine learning paradigm offers the promise of enabling &amp;#8220;programming by demonstration&amp;#8221; for developing high-performance robotic         systems. Unfortunately, many &amp;#8220;behavioral cloning&amp;#8221; (Bain and Sammut in Machine intelligence agents. London: Oxford University         Press, 1995; Pomerleau in Advances in neural information processing systems 1, 1989; LeCun et al. in Advances in neural information processing systems 18, 2006) approaches that utilize classical tools of supervised learning (e.g. decision trees, neural networks, or support vector         machines) do not fit the needs of modern robotic systems. These systems are often built atop sophisticated planning algorithms         that efficiently reason far into the future; consequently, ignoring these planning algorithms in lieu of a supervised learning         approach often leads to myopic and poor-quality robot performance.                     While planning algorithms have shown success in many real-world applications ranging from legged locomotion (Chestnutt et               al. in Proceedings of the IEEE-RAS international conference on humanoid robots, 2003) to outdoor unstructured navigation (Kelly et al. in Proceedings of the international symposium on experimental robotics               (ISER), 2004; Stentz et al. in AUVSI&amp;#8217;s unmanned systems, 2007), such algorithms rely on fully specified cost functions that map sensor readings and environment models to quantifiable               costs. Such cost functions are usually manually designed and programmed. Recently, a set of techniques has been developed               that explore learning these functions from expert human demonstration. These algorithms apply an inverse optimal control approach to find a cost function for which planned behavior mimics an expert&amp;#8217;s demonstration.            </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Jenhwa Guo1 </authors><title>Maneuvering and control of a biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicle      </title><content>This work presents an approach for maneuvering and controlling a biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicle (BAUV). The BAUV         swims forward by oscillating its body and caudal fin. It turns by bending its body and caudal fin toward the intended direction         of motion. A body-spline function is specified by a set of parameters. Genetic algorithms are then used to find the values         of the parameter by evaluating a fitness function over several swimming trials in a water tank. The fitness function is defined         as the ratio of the kinetic energy of the forward motion to the required driving power of the joint motors. A control law         that uses the oscillating frequency to control the forward speed, and applies a body-spline offset parameter to control the         yawing rate is proposed. Moving averages of swimming speeds and heading angles are utilized as feedback signals to control         the forward speed and heading angle of the BAUV. The effectiveness of the control algorithm is experimentally confirmed.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Anna Petrovskaya1  | Sebastian Thrun1 </authors><title>Model based vehicle detection and tracking for autonomous urban driving      </title><content>Situational awareness is crucial for autonomous driving in urban environments. This paper describes the moving vehicle detection         and tracking module that we developed for our autonomous driving robot Junior. The robot won second place in the Urban Grand         Challenge, an autonomous driving race organized by the U.S. Government in 2007. The module provides reliable detection and         tracking of moving vehicles from a high-speed moving platform using laser range finders. Our approach models both dynamic         and geometric properties of the tracked vehicles and estimates them using a single Bayes filter per vehicle. We present the         notion of motion evidence, which allows us to overcome the low signal-to-noise ratio that arises during rapid detection of         moving vehicles in noisy urban environments. Furthermore, we show how to build consistent and efficient 2D representations         out of 3D range data and how to detect poorly visible black vehicles. Experimental validation includes the most challenging         conditions presented at the Urban Grand Challenge as well as other urban settings.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Antoni Burguera1 | Yol|a GonzГЎlez1  | Gabriel Oliver1 </authors><title>On the use of likelihood fields to perform sonar scan matching localization      </title><content>Scan matching algorithms have been extensively used in the last years to perform mobile robot localization. Although these         algorithms require dense and accurate sets of readings with which to work, such as the ones provided by laser range finders,         different studies have shown that scan matching localization is also possible with sonar sensors. Both sonar and laser scan         matching algorithms are usually based on the ideas introduced in the ICP (Iterative Closest Point) approach. In this paper a different approach to scan matching, the Likelihood Field based approach, is presented. Three         scan matching algorithms based on this concept, the non filtered sNDT (sonar Normal Distributions Transform), the filtered sNDT and the LF/SoG (Likelihood Field/Sum of Gaussians), are introduced and analyzed. These algorithms are experimentally evaluated and compared to previously existing ICP-based         algorithms. The obtained results suggest that the Likelihood Field based approach compares favorably with algorithms from         the ICP family in terms of robustness and accuracy. The convergence speed, as well as the time requirements, are also experimentally         evaluated and discussed.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Andrej Gams1 | Auke J.

The system is used to learn         periodic tasks on a humanoid HOAP-2 robot. The first layer of the system is a dynamical system responsible for extracting         the fundamental frequency of the input signal, based on adaptive frequency oscillators. The second layer is a dynamical system         responsible for learning of the waveform based on a built-in learning algorithm. By combining the two dynamical systems into         one system we can rapidly teach new trajectories to robots without any knowledge of the frequency of the demonstration signal.         The system extracts and learns only one period of the demonstration signal. Furthermore, the trajectories are robust to perturbations         and can be modulated to cope with a dynamic environment. The system is computationally inexpensive, works on-line for any         periodic signal, requires no additional signal processing to determine the frequency of the input signal and can be applied         in parallel to multiple dimensions. Additionally, it can adapt to changes in frequency and shape, e.g. to non-stationary signals,         such as hand-generated signals and human demonstrations.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Martin Riedmiller1 | Thomas Gabel1| Rol| Hafner1 | Sascha Lange1</authors><title>Reinforcement learning for robot soccer      </title><content>Batch reinforcement learning methods provide a powerful framework for learning efficiently and effectively in autonomous robots.

However in order to realize this goal, a robot must         be aware of its location within an environment. Therefore, the localization problem (i.e.,the problem of determining robot         pose relative to a map of its environment) must be addressed. This paper proposes a new biology-inspired approach to this         problem. It takes advantage of models of species reproduction to provide a suitable framework for maintaining the multi-hypothesis.         In addition, various strategies to track robot pose are proposed and investigated through statistical comparisons.                                             The Bacterial Colony Growth Algorithm (BCGA) provides two different levels of modeling: a background level that carries on the multi-hypothesis and a foreground level that identifies the best hypotheses according to an exchangeable strategy. Experiments, carried out on the robot ATRV-Jr               manufactured by iRobot, show the effectiveness of the proposed BCGA.                           </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Andrea Cherubini1 | Giuseppe Oriolo1 | Francesco MacrГ­1| Fabio Aloise2 | Febo Cincotti2  | Donatella Mattia2 </authors><title>A multimode navigation system for an assistive robotics project      </title><content>Assistive technology is an emerging area, where robotic devices can help individuals with motor disabilities to achieve independence         in daily activities. This paper deals with a system that provides remote control of Sony AIBO, a commercial mobile robot,         within the assistive project ASPICE. The robot can be controlled by various input devices, including a Brain-Computer Interface.         AIBO has been chosen for its friendly-looking aspect, in order to ease interaction with the patients. The development of the         project is described by focusing on the design of the robot navigation system. Single step, semi-autonomous and autonomous         navigation modes have been realized to provide different levels of control. Automatic collision avoidance is integrated in         all cases. Other features of the system, such as the video feedback from the robotic platform to the user, and the use of         AIBO as communication aid, are briefly described. The performance of the navigation system is shown by simulations as well         as experiments. The system has been clinically validated, in order to obtain a definitive assessment through patient feedback.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>SungHwan Ahn1 | Jinwoo Choi1 | Nakju Lett Doh2  | Wan Kyun Chung1 </authors><title>A practical approach for EKF-SLAM in an indoor environment: fusing ultrasonic sensors and stereo camera      </title><content>         Improving the practical capability of SLAM requires effective sensor fusion to cope with the large uncertainties from the         sensors and environment. Fusing ultrasonic and vision sensors possesses advantages of both economical efficiency and complementary         cooperation. In particular, it can resolve the false data association and divergence problem of an ultrasonic sensor-only         algorithm and overcome both the low frequency of SLAM update caused by the computational burden and the weakness to illumination         changes of a vision sensor-only algorithm. In this paper, we propose a VR-SLAM (Vision and Range sensor-SLAM) algorithm to         combine ultrasonic sensors and stereo camera very effectively. It consists of two schemes: (1);extracting robust point and         line features from sonar data and (2);recognizing planar visual objects using a multi-scale Harris corner detector and its         SIFT descriptor from a pre-constructed object database. We show that fusing these schemes through EKF-SLAM frameworks can         achieve correct data association via the object recognition and high frequency update via the sonar features. The performance         of the proposed algorithm was verified by experiments in various real indoor environments.               </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Geoffrey Biggs1  | Bruce A.

One area of robotics programming that can be supported by an application-specific         approach is dimensioned data. Robot programs typically manage a substantial amount of dimensioned data. However, existing         robot programming tools do not directly support the description and manipulation of dimensioned quantities. A;new system is         presented for managing dimensioned data in robot software. The design provides a new primitive data type to support dimensioned         data. Its unique syntax improves program readability and writability. Dimensional consistency is automatically checked by         the system and any errors are reported, significantly easing the debugging of dimensioned data and improving the reliability         of robot software. The data type is evaluated by common criteria for evaluating programming languages and a small user study,         and is found to be an improvement.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Erik Berglund1 | Joaquin Sitte2  | Gordon Wyeth1 </authors><title>Active audition using the parameter-less self-organising map      </title><content>This paper presents a novel method for enabling a robot to determine the position of a sound source in three dimensions using         just two microphones and interaction with its environment.

Moreover,         most of the applications have used the robot as an end or a passive tool of the learning activity, where the robot has been         constructed or programmed. In this paper, we present a novel application of robotic technologies to education, where we use         the real world situatedness of a robot to teach non-robotic related subjects, such as math and physics. Furthermore, we also         provide the robot with a suitable degree of autonomy to actively guide and mediate in the development of the educational activity.         We present our approach as an educational framework based on a collaborative and constructivist learning environment, where         the robot is able to act as an interaction mediator capable of managing the interactions occurring among the working students.         We illustrate the use of this framework by a 4-step methodology that is used to implement two educational activities. These         activities were tested at local schools with encouraging results. Accordingly, the main contributions of this work are: i);A         novel use of a mobile robot to illustrate and teach relevant concepts and properties of the real world; ii);A novel use of         robots as mediators that autonomously guide an educational activity using a collaborative and constructivist learning approach;         iii);The implementation and testing of these ideas in a real scenario, working with students at local schools.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Bradley Hamner1 | Sanjiv Singh1 | Stephan Roth1  | Takeshi Takahashi1 </authors><title>An efficient system for combined route traversal and collision avoidance      </title><content>         Here we consider the problem of a robot that must follow a previously designated path outdoors. While the nominal path, a         series of closely spaced via points, is provided with an assurance that it will lead to the destination, we can&amp;#8217;t be guaranteed         that it will be obstacle free. We present an efficient system capable of both following the path as well as being perceptive         and agile enough to avoid obstacles in its way. We present a system that detects obstacles using laser ranging, as well as         a layered system that continuously tracks the path, avoiding obstacles and replanning the route when necessary. The distinction         of this system is that compared to the state of the art, it is minimal in sensing and computation while achieving high speeds.         In this paper, we present an algorithm that is based on models of obstacle avoidance by humans and show variations of the         model to deal with practical considerations. We show how the parameters of this model are automatically learned from observation         of human operation and discuss limitations of the model. We then show how these models can be extended by adding online route         planning and a formulation that allows for operation at varying speeds.

In a support phase, an asymmetric trajectories         for the hip and swing leg of the biped robots is obtained from an approximated running model with two springless legs and         a spring-loaded inverted pendulum model so that the zero moment point should exist inside the safety boundary of a supporting         foot, and the supporting leg should absorb large reaction forces, take off and fly through the air. The biped robot is under-actuated         with six degrees of under-actuation during flight. The trajectory generation strategies for the hip and both legs in a flight         phase use the approximated running model and non-holonomic constraints based on the linear and angular momenta at the mass         center. Next, we present an impedance control with a force modulation strategy to guarantee a stable landing on the ground         and simultaneously track the desired trajectories where the desired impedance at the hip link and both legs is specified.         A series of computer simulations for two different types of biped robots show that the proposed running trajectory and impedance         control method satisfy the two conditions for running stability and make the biped robot more robust to variations in the         desired running speed, gait transitions between walking and running, and parametric modeling errors. We have examined the         feasibility of this method with running experiments on a 12-DOF biped robot without arms.

This architecture relies on the integration of kinesthetic and         visual information derived from artificial landmarks, as well as on Hebbian learning, to build a holistic topological-metric         spatial representation during exploration, and employs reinforcement learning by means of an Actor-Critic architecture to         enable learning and unlearning of goal locations. From a robotics perspective, this work can be placed in the gap between         mapping and map exploitation currently existent in the SLAM literature. The exploitation of the cognitive map allows the robot         to recognize places already visited and to find a target from any given departure location, thus enabling goal-directed navigation.

The proposed algorithm is validated using experimental         data collected with an autonomous robot operating in an outdoor environment. Additionally, two detector fusion techniques         are proposed to combine the outputs of multiple immobilization detectors.

In the investigation of the effects of compliance on the energetic efficiency of walking,         four cases were studied: one without springs and three with springs of different stiffnesses and preloads. It was found that         for low-speed walking, the addition of soft springs may be used to increase energetic efficiency, while stiffer springs decrease         the energetic efficiency.

The goal of this research is to preserve         the versatility of actively controlled humanoids, while reducing their energy consumption. The biped Lucy, powered by pleated         pneumatic artificial muscles, has been built and controlled and is able to walk up to a speed of 0.15 m/s. The pressures inside         the muscles are controlled by a joint trajectory tracking controller to track the desired joint trajectories calculated by         a trajectory generator. However, the actuators are set to a fixed stiffness value. In this paper a compliance controller is         presented to reduce the energy consumption by controlling the stiffness. A mathematical formulation has been developed to         find an optimal stiffness setting depending on the desired trajectory and physical properties of the system and the proposed         strategy has been validated on a pendulum structure powered by artificial muscles. This strategy has not been implemented         on the real robot because the walking speed of the robot is currently too slow to benefit already from compliance control.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Benjamin Lavis1 | Tomonari Furukawa1 | Hugh F.

In particular, marine search and rescue scenarios are considered, highlighting         the need for space reconfiguration in situations where moving targets are involved. The proposed technique improves the search         space configuration by maintaining the validity of the recursive Bayesian estimation. The advantage of the technique is that         autonomous search and tracking can be performed indefinitely, without loss of information. Numerical results first show the         effectiveness of the technique with a single search vehicle and a single moving target. The efficacy of the approach for coordinated         autonomous search and tracking is shown through simulation, incorporating multiple search vehicles and multiple targets.

This endeavor is motivated by an application whereby a large number of Swarming Micro Air Vehicles (SMAVs), of fixed-wing               configuration, must organize autonomously to establish a wireless communication network (SMAVNET) between users located on               ground. Rather than relative or absolute positioning, agents must rely only on their own heading measurements and local communication               with neighbors.            </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Stefano Carpin1 </authors><title>Fast and accurate map merging for multi-robot systems      </title><content>We present a new algorithm for merging occupancy grid maps produced by multiple robots exploring the same environment. The         algorithm produces a set of possible transformations needed to merge two maps, i.e translations and rotations. Each transformation         is weighted, thus allowing to distinguish uncertain situations, and enabling to track multiple cases when ambiguities arise.         Transformations are produced extracting some spectral information from the maps. The approach is deterministic, non-iterative, and fast. The algorithm has been tested on public available         datasets, as well as on maps produced by two robots concurrently exploring both indoor and outdoor environments.

To ensure the safety         and performance of AGVs on these terrains, a terrain-dependent driving and control system can be implemented. A key first         step in implementing this system is autonomous terrain classification. It has recently been shown that the magnitude of the         spatial frequency response of the terrain is an effective terrain signature. Furthermore, since the spatial frequency response         is mapped by an AGV&amp;#8217;s vibration transfer function to the frequency response of the vibration measurements, the magnitude of         the latter frequency responses also serve as a terrain signature. Hence, this paper focuses on terrain classification using         vibration measurements. Classification is performed using a probabilistic neural network, which can be implemented online         at relatively high computational speeds. The algorithm is applied experimentally to both an ATRV-Jr and an eXperimental Unmanned         Vehicle (XUV) at multiple speeds. The experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed approach.               </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Masashi Sugiyama1| 2 | Hirotaka Hachiya1 | Christopher Towell2  | Sethu Vijayakumar2 </authors><title>Geodesic Gaussian kernels for value function approximation      </title><content>The least-squares policy iteration approach works efficiently in value function approximation, given appropriate basis functions.

The navigation framework         for wheeled mobile robots presented in this paper is based on this assumption. During a human-guided learning step, the robot         performs paths which are sampled and stored as a set of ordered key images, acquired by an embedded camera. The set of these         obtained visual paths is topologically organized and provides a visual memory of the environment. Given an image of one of         the visual paths as a target, the robot navigation mission is defined as a concatenation of visual path subsets, called visual         route. When running autonomously, the robot is controlled by a visual servoing law adapted to its nonholonomic constraint.         Based on the regulation of successive homographies, this control guides the robot along the reference visual route without         explicitly planning any trajectory. The proposed framework has been designed for the entire class of central catadioptric         cameras (including conventional cameras). It has been validated onto two architectures. In the first one, algorithms have         been implemented onto a dedicated hardware and the robot is equipped with a standard perspective camera. In the second one,         they have been implemented on a standard PC and an omnidirectional camera is considered.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Luis Montesano1 | Javier Minguez2 | Luis Montano2</authors><title>Modeling dynamic scenarios for local sensor-based motion planning      </title><content>This paper addresses the modeling of the static and dynamic parts of the scenario and how to use this information with a sensor-based         motion planning system. The contribution in the modeling aspect is a formulation of the detection and tracking of mobile objects         and the mapping of the static structure in such a way that the nature (static/dynamic) of the observations is included in         the estimation process. The algorithm provides a set of filters tracking the moving objects and a local map of the static         structure constructed on line. In addition, this paper discusses how this modeling module is integrated in a real sensor-based         motion planning system taking advantage selectively of the dynamic and static information. The experimental results confirm         that the complete navigation system is able to move a vehicle in unknown and dynamic scenarios. Furthermore, the system overcomes         many of the limitations of previous systems associated to the ability to distinguish the nature of the parts of the scenario.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Brian Smith1 | Ayanna Howard1 | John-Michael McNew2 | Jiuguang Wang1  | Magnus Egerstedt1 </authors><title>Multi-robot deployment and coordination with Embedded Graph Grammars      </title><content>This paper presents a framework for going from specifications to implementations of decentralized control strategies for multi-robot         systems.

Indeed, the wheels of the robot unequivocally force the robot vehicle to move tangentially to its main axis.         Here we test the hypothesis that human locomotion can also be partly described by such a nonholonomic system. This hypothesis         is inspired by the trivial observation that humans do not walk sideways: some constraints of different natures (anatomical,         mechanical&amp;#8230;) may restrict the way humans generate locomotor trajectories. To model these constraints, we propose a simple         differential system satisfying the so called rolling without sliding constraint. We validated the proposed model by comparing simulated trajectories with actual (recorded) trajectories obtained         from goal-oriented locomotion of human subjects. These subjects had to start from a pre-defined position and direction in         space and cross over to a distant porch so that both initial and final positions and directions were controlled. A comparative         analysis was successfully undertaken by making use of numerical methods to compute the control inputs from actual trajectories.         To achieve this, three body segments were used as local reference frames: head, pelvis and torso. The best simulations were         obtained using the last body segment. We therefore suggest an analogy between the steering wheels and the torso segment, meaning         that for the control of locomotion, the trunk behavior is constrained in a nonholonomic manner. Our approach allowed us to         successfully predict 87 percent of trajectories recorded in seven subjects and might be particularly relevant for future pluridisciplinary         research programs dealing with modeling of biological locomotor behaviors.               </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Micha Hersch1  | Aude G.

The resulting controller is based on         two concurrent dynamical systems acting on different, yet redundant variables. The first dynamical system acts on the end-effector         location variables and the second one acts on the joint angle variables. Coherence constraints are enforced between those         two redundant representations of the movement and can be used to modulate the relative influence of each dynamical system.

The vision component uses Gabor wavelet filters for texture analysis to find ruts and tracks from         which the road vanishing point can be inferred via Hough-style voting, yielding a direction estimate for steering control.         The ladar component projects detected obstacles along the road direction onto the plane of the front of the vehicle and tracks         the 1-D obstacle &amp;#8220;gap&amp;#8221; presumed due to the road to yield a lateral offset estimate. Several image- and state-based tests to         detect failure conditions such as off-road poses (i.e., there is no road to follow) and poor lighting due to sun glare or         distracting shadows are also explained. The system&amp;#8217;s efficacy is demonstrated with analysis of diverse logged data including         from the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge, as well as tests with full control of a vehicle over 15 km of difficult roads at up to         37 km/h with no waypoints.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Jonas Buchli2| 1  | Auke Jan Ijspeert2</authors><title>Self-organized adaptive legged locomotion in a compliant quadruped robot      </title><content>In this contribution we present experiments of an adaptive locomotion controller on a compliant quadruped robot. The adaptive         controller consists of adaptive frequency oscillators in different configurations and produces dynamic gaits such as bounding         and jumping. We show two main results: (1);The adaptive controller is able to track the resonant frequency of the robot which         is a function of different body parameters (2);controllers based on dynamical systems as we present are able to &amp;#8220;recognize&amp;#8221;         mechanically intrinsic modes of locomotion, adapt to them and enforce them. More specifically the main results are supported         by several experiments, showing first that the adaptive controller is constantly tracking body properties and readjusting         to them. Second, that important gait parameters are dependent on the geometry and movement of the robot and the controller         can account for that. Third, that local control is sufficient and the adaptive controller can adapt to the different mechanical         modes. And finally, that key properties of the gaits are not only depending on properties of the body but also the actual         mode of movement that the body is operating in. We show that even if we specify the gait pattern on the level of the CPG the         chosen gait pattern does not necessarily correspond to the CPG&amp;#8217;s pattern. Furthermore, we present the analytical treatment         of adaptive frequency oscillators in closed feedback loops, and compare the results to the data from the robot experiments.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Dezhen Song1 | Ni Qin1  | Ken Goldberg2 </authors><title>Systems, control models, and codec for collaborative observation of remote environments with an;autonomous networked robotic         camera      </title><content>Networked robotic cameras are becoming popular in remote observation applications such as natural observation, surveillance,         and distance learning.

The optimal selection of;camera control parameters for competing observation         requests and the on-demand delivery of video content for various spatiotemporal queries are two challenges in the design of         such autonomous systems. For camera control, we introduce memoryless and temporal frame selection models that effectively         enable collaborative control of the camera based on the competing inputs from in-situ sensors and users. For content delivery, we design a patch-based motion panorama representation and coding/decoding algorithms         (codec) to allow efficient storage and computation. We present system architecture, frame selection models, user interface,         and codec algorithms.

In the top-down         approach, the design process starts with specifying the global system state and assuming that each component has global knowledge         of the system, as in a centralized approach. The solution is then decentralized by replacing global knowledge with communication.         In the bottom-up approach, on the other hand, the design starts with specifying requirements and capabilities of individual         components, and the global behavior is said to emerge out of interactions among constituent components and between components         and the environment. In this paper we present a comparative study of both approaches with particular emphasis on applications         to multi-agent system engineering and robotics. We outline the generic characteristics of both approaches from the MAS perspective,         and identify three elements that we believe should serve as criteria for how and when to apply either of the approaches. We         demonstrate our analysis on a specific example of load balancing problem in robotics. We also show that under certain assumptions         on the communication and the external environment, both bottom-up and top-down methodologies produce very similar solutions.               </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Hans de Ruiter1  | Beno Benhabib1 </authors><title>Visual-model-based, real-time 3D pose tracking for autonomous navigation: methodology and experiments      </title><content>This paper presents a novel 3D-model-based computer-vision method for tracking the full six degree-of-freedom (dof) pose (position         and orientation) of a rigid body, in real-time. The methodology has been targeted for autonomous navigation tasks, such as         interception of or rendezvous with mobile targets. Tracking an object&amp;#8217;s complete six-dof pose makes the proposed algorithm         useful even when targets are not restricted to planar motion (e.g., flying or rough-terrain navigation). Tracking is achieved         via a combination of textured model projection and optical flow. The main contribution of our work is the novel combination         of optical flow with z-buffer depth information that is produced during model projection. This allows us to achieve six-dof tracking with a single         camera.                     A localized illumination normalization filter also has been developed in order to improve robustness to shading. Real-time               operation is achieved using GPU-based filters and a new data-reduction algorithm based on colour-gradient redundancy, which was developed within the framework of our project. Colour-gradient redundancy is an important property of colour images,               namely, that the gradients of all colour channels are generally aligned. Exploiting this property provides a threefold increase               in speed. A processing rate of approximately 80 to 100 fps has been obtained in our work when utilizing synthetic and real               target-motion sequences. Sub-pixel accuracies were obtained in tests performed under different lighting conditions.            </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Dominique Martinez1 | Oliver Rochel1 | Etienne Hugues1</authors><title>A biomimetic robot for tracking specific odors in turbulent plumes      </title><content>Two basic tasks must be performed by an olfactory robot tracking a specific odor source: navigate in a turbulent odor plume         and recognize an odor regardless of its concentration.

The problem is mathematically formulated as designing the cooperative control for a general         class of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) dynamical systems in canonical form with arbitrary but finite relative degrees         such that the outputs of the overall system converge to the explicitly given steady state. The proposed cooperative control for individual vehicle only need to use the sensed and communicated         outputs information from its local neighboring vehicles. No fixed leader and time-invariant communication networks are assumed         among vehicles. Particularly, a set of less-restrictive conditions on the connectivity of the sensor/communication networks         are established, under which it is rigorously proven by using the newly found nice properties of the convergence of sequences         of row stochastic matrices that the cooperative objective of the overall system can be achieved. Simulation results for a         group of vehicles achieving a target and surrounding a specified object in formation are provided to support the proposed         approach in this paper.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Udo Frese1 </authors><title>A Discussion of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping      </title><content>This paper aims at a discussion of the structure of the SLAM problem.

A human teaches a route to the robot, and the developed         robot behaves similar to a human listener by utilizing both temporal and spatial cooperative behaviors to demonstrate that         it is indeed listening to its human counterpart. The robot's software consists of many communicative units and rules for selecting         appropriate communicative units. A communicative unit realizes a particular cooperative behavior such as eye-contact and nodding,         found through previous research in HRI. The rules for selecting communicative units were retrieved through our preliminary         experiments with a WOZ method. An experiment was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the robot, with the results revealing         that a robot displaying cooperative behavior received the highest subjective evaluation, which is rather similar to a human         listener. A detailed analysis showed that this evaluation was mainly due to body movements as well as utterances.

Each individually autonomous mobile manipulator         consists of a differentially-driven Wheeled Mobile Robot (WMR) with a mounted two degree-of-freedom (d.o.f) revolute-jointed,         planar and passive manipulator arm. The composite wheeled vehicle, formed by placing a payload at the end-effectors of two         (or more) such mobile manipulators, has the capability to accommodate, detect and correct both instantaneous and finite relative         configuration errors.                     The kinematically-compatible motion-planning/control framework developed here is intended to facilitate maintenance of all               kinematic (holonomic and nonholonomic) constraints within such systems. Given an arbitrary end-effector trajectory, each individual               mobile-manipulator's bi-level hierarchical controller first generates a kinematically-feasible desired trajectory for the WMR base, which is then tracked by a suitable lower-level posture stabilizing controller. Two variants of system-level               cooperative control schemes&amp;#8212;leader-follower and decentralized control&amp;#8212;are then created based on the individual mobile-manipulator               control scheme. Both methods are evaluated within an implementation framework that emphasizes both virtual prototyping (VP)               and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimentation. Simulation and experimental results of an example of a two-module system are               used to highlight the capabilities of a real-time local sensor-based controller for accommodation, detection and corection               of relative formation errors.            </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>C.

Unfortunately,         when traditional therapy is provided in a hospital or rehabilitation center, the patient is usually seen for few hours a week.         Robot-mediated therapies could improve this situation but even if interesting results have been achieved by several groups,         the use of robot-mediated therapy has not become very common in clinical practice. This is due to many different reasons (e.g.,         the &amp;#8220;technophobia&amp;#8221; of some clinicians, the need for more extensive clinical trials) but one of the more important is the cost         and the complexity of these devices which make them difficult to be purchased and used in all the clinical centers.

Biological studies have already demonstrated the use of various search methods (e.g., chemotaxis and biased random         walk), but robotics research could provide new ways to investigate principles of olfactory-based search skills (Webb, 2000;         Grasso, 2001). In previous studies on odour source localisation, we have tested three biologically inspired search strategies:         chemotaxis, biased random walk, and a combination of these methods (Kadar and Virk, 1998; Lytridis et;al., 2001). The main         objective of the present paper is to demonstrate how simulation and robot experiments could be used conjointly to systematically         study these search strategies. Specifically, simulation studies are used to calibrate and test our three strategies in concentric         diffusion fields with various noise levels. An experiment with a mobile robot was also conducted to assess these strategies         in a real diffusion field. The results of this experiment are similar to those of simulation studies showing that chemotaxis         is a more efficient but less robust strategy than biased random walk. Overall, the combined strategy seems to be superior         to chemotaxis and biased random walk in both simulation and robot experiment.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Javier Minguez1 | Luis Montano1  | JosГ© Santos-Victor2 </authors><title>Abstracting Vehicle Shape and Kinematic Constraints from Obstacle Avoidance Methods      </title><content>Most obstacle avoidance techniques do not take into account vehicle shape and kinematic constraints. They assume a punctual         and omnidirectional vehicle and thus they are doomed to rely on approximations when used on real vehicles. Our main contribution         is a framework to consider shape and kinematics together in an exact manner in the obstacle avoidance process, by abstracting         these constraints from the avoidance method usage. Our approach can be applied to many non-holonomic vehicles with arbitrary         shape.                     For these vehicles, the configuration space is three-dimensional, while the control space is two-dimensional. The main idea               is to construct (centred on the robot at any time) the two-dimensional manifold of the configuration space that is defined               by elementary circular paths. This manifold contains all the configurations that can be attained at each step of the obstacle               avoidance and is thus general for all methods. Another important contribution of the paper is the exact calculus of the obstacle               representation in this manifold for any robot shape (i.e. the configuration regions in collision). Finally, we propose a change               of coordinates of this manifold so that the elementary paths become straight lines. Therefore, the three-dimensional obstacle               avoidance problem with kinematic constraints is transformed into the simple obstacle avoidance problem for a point moving               in a two-dimensional space without any kinematic restriction (the usual approximation in obstacle avoidance). Thus, existing               avoidance techniques become applicable.            </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Pawel Pyk1 | Sergi BermГєdez i Badia1| Ulysses Bernardet1| Philipp KnГјsel1| Mikael Carlsson3| Jing Gu4| Eric Chanie5| Bill S.

One particular         domain of interest is chemical search where a number of efforts are underway to construct mobile chemical search and localization         systems. We report on a project that aims at constructing such a system based on our understanding of the pheromone communication         system of the moth. Based on an overview of the peripheral processing of chemical cues by the moth and its role in the organization         of behavior we emphasize the multimodal aspects of chemical search, i.e. optomotor anemotactic chemical search. We present         a model of this behavior that we test in combination with a novel thin metal oxide sensor and custom build mobile robots.         We show that the sensor is able to detect the odor cue, ethanol, under varying flow conditions. Subsequently we show that         the standard model of insect chemical search, consisting of a surge and cast phases, provides for robust search and localization         performance. The same holds when it is augmented with an optomotor collision avoidance model based on the Lobula Giant Movement         Detector (LGMD) neuron of the locust. We compare our results to others who have used the moth as inspiration for the construction         of odor robots.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Shugen Ma1| 2  | Naoki Tadokoro3 </authors><title>Analysis of Creeping Locomotion of a Snake-like Robot on a Slope      </title><content>The diverse locomotion modes and physiology of biological snakes make them supremely adapted for their environment.

One of these mechanisms is attentive perception. Findings from vision science research         suggest that attentive perception requires a multitude of properties: A retina with fovea-periphery distinction, an attention         mechanism that can be manipulated both mechanically and internally, an extensive set of visual primitives that enable different         representation modes, an integration mechanism that can infer the appropriate visual information in spite of eye, head, body         and target motion, and finally memory for guiding eye movements and modeling the environment. In this paper we present an         attentively &amp;#8220;perceiving&amp;#8221; robot called APES. The novelty of this system stems from the fact that it incorporates all of these         properties simultaneously. As is explained, original approaches have to be taken to realize each of the properties so that         they can be integrated together in an attentive perception framework.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Erol &amp;#350 ahin1 | Sertan Girgin1 | Emre U&amp;#287 ur1</authors><title>Area measurement of large closed regions with a mobile robot      </title><content>How can a mobile robot measure the area of a closed region that is beyond its immediate sensing range? This problem, which         we name as blind area measurement, is inspired from scout worker ants who assess potential nest cavities. We first review the insect studies that have shown         that these scouts, who work in dark, seem to assess arbitrary closed spaces and reliably reject nest sites that are small         for the colony. We briefly describe the hypothesis that these scouts use &amp;#8220;Buffon&amp;#8217;s needle method&amp;#8221; to measure the area of the         nest. Then we evaluate and analyze this method for mobile robots to measure large closed regions. We use a simulated mobile         robot system to evaluate the performance of the method through systematic experiments. The results showed that the method         can reliably measure the area of large and rather open, closed regions regardless of their shape and compactness. Moreover,         the method&amp;#8217;s performance seems to be undisturbed by the existence of objects and by partial barriers placed inside these regions.         Finally, at a smaller scale, we partially verified some of these results on a real mobile robot platform.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Andrew G. Brooks1  | Ronald C.

In order to allow the         robot to communicate information non-verbally while simultaneously fulfilling its existing instrumental behavior, a &amp;#8220;behavioral         overlay&amp;#8221; model that encodes this data onto the robot's pre-existing motor expression is developed and presented. The state         of the robot's system of internal emotions and motivational drives is used as the principal data source for non-verbal expression,         but in order for the robot to display this information in a natural and nuanced fashion, an additional para-emotional framework         has been developed to support the individuality of the robot's interpersonal relationships with humans and of the robot itself.         An implementation on the Sony QRIO is described which overlays QRIO's existing EGO architecture and situated schema-based         behaviors with a mechanism for communicating this framework through modalities that encompass posture, gesture and the management         of interpersonal distance.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Thomas Bock1 </authors><title>Construction robotics      </title><content>First construction robots had been designed in the beginning seventies in order to increase the quality in prefabrication         of modular homes in Japan and the late 70ies planning started for use of robots in construction sites.

Related work on around fifteen such robots is presented, compared and discussed. Based on this survey, design         considerations leading to a novel design for a self-reconfigurable robot, called &amp;#8220;ATRON&amp;#8221;, is described. The ATRON robot is         a lattice-based self-reconfigurable robot with modules composed of two hemispheres joined by a single revolute joint. Mechanical         design and resulting system properties are described and discussed, based on FEM analyses as well as real-world experiments.         It is concluded that the ATRON design is both competent and novel. Even though the ATRON modules are minimalistic, in the         sense that they have only one actuated degree of freedom, the collective of modules is capable of self-reconfiguring in three         dimensions.

This work presents a new approach to door-detection in indoor environments using computer vision. Doors are         found in gray-level images by detecting the borders of their architraves. A variation of the Hough Transform is used in order         to extract the segments in the image after applying the Canny edge detector. Features like length, direction, or distance         between segments are used by a fuzzy system to analyze whether the relationship between them reveals the existence of doors.         The system has been designed to detect rectangular doors typical of many indoor environments by the use of expert knowledge.         Besides, a tuning mechanism based on a genetic algorithm is proposed to improve the performance of the system according to         the particularities of the environment in which it is going to be employed. A large database of images containing doors of         our building, seen from different angles and distances, has been created to test the performance of the system before and         after the tuning process. The system has shown the ability to detect rectangular doors under heavy perspective deformations         and it is fast enough to be used for real-time applications in a mobile robot.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>James Kramer1  | Matthias Scheutz1 </authors><title>Development environments for autonomous mobile robots: A survey      </title><content>         Robotic Development Environments (RDEs) have come to play an increasingly important role in robotics research in general, and for the development of architectures         for mobile robots in particular. Yet, no systematic evaluation of available RDEs has been performed; establishing a comprehensive         list of evaluation criteria targeted at robotics applications is desirable that can subsequently be used to compare their         strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, there are no practical evaluations of the usability and impact of a large selection of         RDEs that provides researchers with the information necessary to select an RDE most suited to their needs, nor identifies         trends in RDE research that suggest directions for future RDE development.                     This survey addresses the above by selecting and describing nine open source, freely available RDEs for mobile robots, evaluating               and comparing them from various points of view. First, based on previous work concerning agent systems, a conceptual framework               of four broad categories is established, encompassing the characteristics and capabilities that an RDE supports. Then, a practical               evaluation of RDE; usability in designing, implementing, and executing robot architectures is presented. Finally, the impact of specific RDEs on the field of robotics is addressed by providing a list of published applications and research projects               that give concrete examples of areas in which systems have been used. The comprehensive evaluation and comparison of the nine               RDEs concludes with suggestions of how to use the results of this survey and a brief discussion of future trends in RDE design.            </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Arianna Menciassi1| 2 | Dino Accoto1| Samuele Gorini1 | Paolo Dario1</authors><title>Development of a biomimetic miniature robotic crawler      </title><content>The paper presents the development of segmented artificial crawlers endowed with passive hook-shaped frictional microstructures.

Curtain wall, however, can be         considered a relatively standard material compared to other construction materials. In this study, we analyze the current         process of curtain wall installation and investigate the potential of an automated system combining a commercial excavator         and a 3-DOF manipulator. This automated system has the adaptations necessary to work with any type of commercialized excavator.         Therefore, workers need to transfer only the 3-DOF manipulator portion of the system when they move to other construction         sites.

The formations or aggregates we consider are composed of up to hundreds of robots with the capability of forming         various complex shapes dictated by the shape of the region to be explored, as well as special shapes suitable for migration.         The shapes are determined through bathymetric maps and described with reduced-dimensional representation techniques. The approach         we propose is that of breaking up the control and coordination strategy into two decoupled problems, i.e., partitioning the         aggregate into two non-overlapping sets: its boundary and its interior. The boundary uses general theory of curve evolution         to form shapes while the interior passively complies, using attraction-repulsion forces, to form a uniform distribution inside         the boundary. This makes the problem much more tractable than previous methods. Decision making by individual robots is entirely         based on local information, autonomous underwater vehicles, formation control, swarm control.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Thomas Bock1 | Masahiru Nohmi2 | Miros&amp;#322 aw Skibniewski3</authors><title>Enabling e-business tools and robotics technology for teleconstruction      </title><content>This paper proposes a comprehensive approach to the development of technology infrastructure for the application of information         techology (IT) based solutions in teleconstruction&amp;#8212;the performance of on-site construction and related tasks through the use         of IT and robotics by a remotely located team of project participants: general contractor, subcontractors, equipment operators,         materials suppliers, and project office professionals.

The method proposed is general and works for whatever number of legs         and ropes operated by actuated winches connecting the robot to the environment. The configuration of the robot is assigned.         First, the compliance of the robot body, of the legs and the compliances of the ground and the ropes are modeled as localized         elasticities. The static equilibrium problem of the resulting model is statically-determinate under the hypothesis that the         foot and rope points (where the ropes are fixed to the robot body) are joined to the ground by bilateral constraints. Since         these constraints are unilateral (the feet are contact points and can detach from the ground, and the ropes can become slack),         it is necessary to apply an iterative solving procedure in order to solve the static equilibrium problem. The method presented         in the paper is a fast and effective alternative to nonlinear analysis of a finite element model of the robot at any assigned         configuration.

However, their efficiency decreases dramatically in spaces with narrow passages. This paper presents         a new method&amp;#8212;small-step retraction&amp;#8212;that helps PRM planners find paths through such passages. This method consists of slightly         &amp;#8220;fattening&amp;#8221; robot's free space, constructing a roadmap in fattened free space, and finally repairing portions of this roadmap         by retracting them out of collision into actual free space. Fattened free space is not explicitly computed. Instead, the geometric         models of workspace objects (robot links and/or obstacles) are &amp;#8220;thinned&amp;#8221; around their medial axis. A robot configuration lies         in fattened free space if the thinned objects do not collide at this configuration. Two repair strategies are proposed. The         &amp;#8220;optimist&amp;#8221; strategy waits until a complete path has been found in fattened free space before repairing it. Instead, the &amp;#8220;pessimist&amp;#8221;         strategy repairs the roadmap as it is being built. The former is usually very fast, but may fail in some pathological cases.         The latter is more reliable, but not as fast. A simple combination of the two strategies yields an integrated planner that         is both fast and reliable. This planner was implemented as an extension of a pre-existing single-query PRM planner. Comparative         tests show that it is significantly faster (sometimes by several orders of magnitude) than the pre-existing planner.      </title><content/></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Cecilia Laschi1 | Gioel Asuni1| Eugenio Guglielmelli3| Giancarlo Teti1| 2| Rol| Johansson4| Hitoshi Konosu5| Zbigniew Wasik5| Maria Chiara Carrozza1 | Paolo Dario1</authors><title>A bio-inspired predictive sensory-motor coordination scheme for;robot reaching and preshaping      </title><content>         This paper presents a sensory-motor coordination scheme for a robot hand-arm-head system that provides the robot with the         capability to reach an object while pre-shaping the fingers to the required grasp configuration and while predicting the tactile         image that will be perceived after grasping. A model for sensory-motor coordination derived from studies in humans inspired         the development of this scheme.

Its focus is on how to handle sparse and noisy sensor data, such as PSD         infrared sensors with limited range and limited number, in order to develop a low-cost navigation system. It has been applied         to a vacuum cleaning robot in our research. In order to meet the real-time objective with low computing power, we develop         an efficient line feature extraction algorithm based upon an iterative end point fit (IEPF) technique assisted by our constrained         version of the Hough transform. It uses a geometric constraint that every line is orthogonal or parallel to each other because         in a general indoor setting, most furniture and walls satisfy this constraint. By adding this constraint to the measurement         model of EKF, we build a geometrically constrained EKF framework which can estimate line feature positions more accurately         as well as allow their covariance matrices to converge more rapidly when compared to the case of an unconstrained EKF. The         experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness to the presence of sensor noise and errors in an actual indoor         environment.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Jan Peters1| 4 | Michael Mistry1| Firdaus Udwadia1| Jun Nakanishi2| 3 | Stefan Schaal1| 2</authors><title>A unifying framework for robot control with redundant DOFs      </title><content>         Recently, Udwadia (Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 2003:1783&amp;#8211;1800, 2003) suggested to derive tracking controllers for mechanical systems with redundant degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) using a generalization         of Gauss&amp;#8217; principle of least constraint. This method allows reformulating control problems as a special class of optimal controllers.         In this paper, we take this line of reasoning one step further and demonstrate that several well-known and also novel nonlinear         robot control laws can be derived from this generic methodology. We show experimental verifications on a Sarcos Master Arm         robot for some of the derived controllers. The suggested approach offers a promising unification and simplification of nonlinear         control law design for robots obeying rigid body dynamics equations, both with or without external constraints, with over-actuation         or underactuation, as well as open-chain and closed-chain kinematics.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>J.

A hovercraft is an air vehicle endowed with natural roll and pitch stabilization         characteristics, in which planar flight control systems can be developed conveniently. Our hovercraft is fully actuated by         two rear and two lateral thrusters. It travels at a constant altitude (&amp;#8764;2 mm) and senses the environment by means of two lateral         eyes that measure the right and left optic flows (OFs). The visuo-motor control system, which is called LORA III (Lateral         Optic flow Regulation Autopilot, Mark III), is a dual OF regulator consisting of two intertwined feedback loops, each of which has its own OF set-point and controls the vehicle&amp;#8217;s translation         in one degree of freedom (surge or sway). Our computer-simulated experiments show that the hovercraft can navigate along a         straight or tapered corridor at a relatively high speed (up to 1 m/s). It also reacts to any major step perturbations in the         lateral OF (provided by a moving wall) and to any disturbances caused by a tapered corridor. The minimalistic visual system         (comprised of only 4 pixels) suffices for the hovercraft to be able to control both its clearance from the walls and its forward         speed jointly, without ever measuring speed and distance. The non-emissive visual sensors and the simple control system developed         here are suitable for use on MAVs with a permissible avionic payload of only a few grams. This study also accounts quantitatively for previous ethological findings on honeybees flying freely in a straight or tapered corridor.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Shinya Aoi1  | Kazuo Tsuchiya1 </authors><title>Adaptive behavior in turning of an oscillator-driven biped robot      </title><content>         This paper concentrates on a biped robot&amp;#8217;s turning behavior that consists of straight and curved walking and the transition         between these two patterns. We investigate how a robot achieves adaptive walking during such turning by focusing on rhythm         control and propose a locomotion control system that generates robot motions by rhythmic signals from internal oscillators         and modulates signal generation based on touch sensor signals. First, we verify that the robot attains limit cycles of straight         and curved walking by numerical simulations and hardware experiments. Second, we examine the transition between these walking         patterns based on the basin of attraction of the limit cycles in numerical simulations. Finally, we verify whether the robot         actually accomplishes transition and turning by hardware experiments. This paper clarifies that the robot establishes such         turning motions by adequate modulation of walking rhythm and phase through interactions between the dynamics of its mechanical         system, oscillators, and environment.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Roozbeh Mottaghi1  | Richard Vaughan1 </authors><title>An integrated particle filter and potential field method applied to cooperative multi-robot target tracking      </title><content>         We describe a;novel method whereby a;particle filter is used to create a potential field for robot control without prior clustering.         We show an application of this technique to control a;team of mobile robots to cooperatively locate and track a;moving target.         The particle filter models a;probability distribution over the estimated location of the target, providing robust tracking         despite frequent target occlusion. This method extends previous work in particle-filter-based tracking in two important ways.         First, the particle cloud is never clustered to find a;single estimate of target location. Instead, robot motion is guided         by a;potential field generated directly from the particle cloud. Secondly, effective coordinated multi-robot searching and         tracking can be achieved by simply assigning a;subset of the particles to each robot.

A;simulation model         of the robot is used to obtain the data demonstrating the energy consumption while walking in different modes and with varying         parameters. Based on the analysis of this data some strategies are derived in order to minimize the search effort for determining         the parameters of the gaits for an energy efficient walk. Then, similar data is obtained from an actual experimental setup,         in which the Robot-EA308 is used as the walking machine. The strategies are justified based on this realistic data. The analysis         concludes the following: a phase modified version of wave gaits is more efficient than the (conventional) wave gaits, using         the possible minimum protraction time results in more energy efficient gaits and higher velocity results in less energy consumption         per traveled distance. A stability analysis is performed for the phase modification of the wave gaits, and the stability loss         due to the modification is calculated. It is concluded that the loss in stability is insignificant.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>E. R. Westervelt1 | B. Morris2  | K. D.

Instead         of trying to build high-fidelity geometric maps, we focus on constructing topological maps as they are less sensitive to poor         odometry estimates and position errors. We propose a modification to the standard SLAM algorithm in which the assumption that         the robots can obtain metric distance/bearing information to landmarks is relaxed. Instead, the robot registers a distinctive         sensor &amp;#8220;signature&amp;#8221;, based on its current location, which is used to match robot positions. In our formulation of this non-linear         estimation problem, we infer implicit position measurements from an image recognition algorithm. We propose a method for incrementally         building topological maps for a robot which uses a panoramic camera to obtain images at various locations along its path and         uses the features it tracks in the images to update the topological map. The method is very general and does not require the         environment to have uniquely distinctive features. Two algorithms are implemented to address this problem. The Iterated form         of the Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) and a batch-processed linearized ML estimator are compared under various odometric noise         models.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Michael L.

The HRI trials studied the participants&amp;#8217; preferences for various features of robot appearance and         behavior, as well as their personality attributions towards the robots compared to their own personalities. Overall, participants         tended to prefer robots with more human-like appearance and attributes. However, systematic individual differences in the         dynamic appearance ratings are not consistent with a universal effect. Introverts and participants with lower emotional stability         tended to prefer the mechanical looking appearance to a greater degree than other participants. It is also shown that it is         possible to rate individual elements of a particular robot&amp;#8217;s behavior and then assess the contribution, or otherwise, of that         element to the overall perception of the robot by people. Relating participants&amp;#8217; dynamic appearance ratings of individual         robots to independent static appearance ratings provided evidence that could be taken to support a portion of the left hand         side of Mori&amp;#8217;s theoretically proposed &amp;#8216;uncanny valley&amp;#8217; diagram.

We propose         solutions based on physical cooperation among mobile robots to improve the overall mobility. Our focus is on the development         of the low level system components. Recognizing that small robots need to overcome discrete obstacles, we develop specific         analytical maneuvers to negotiate each obstacle where a maneuver is built from a sequence of fundamental cooperative behaviors. In this paper we present cooperative behaviors that are achieved by interactions among robots via un-actuated links thus         avoiding the need for additional actuation.                                             We analyze the cooperative lift behavior and demonstrate that useful maneuvers such a gap crossing can be built using this behavior. We prove that the requirements               on ground friction and wheel torques set fundamental limits for physical cooperation. Using the design guidelines based on               static analysis we have developed simple and low cost hardware to illustrate cooperative gap crossing with two robots. We               have developed a complete dynamic model of two-robot cooperation which leads to control design. A novel connecting link design               is proposed that can change the system configuration with no additional actuators. A decentralized control architecture is               designed for the two-robot system, where each robot controls its own state with no information about the state of the other               robot thus avoiding the need of continuous communication between the two robots. Simulation and hardware results demonstrate               a successful implementation with the gap crossing example. We have analytically proved that robot dynamics can be used to               reduce the friction requirements and have demonstrated, with simulations, the implementation of this idea for the cooperative               lifting behavior.                           </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Eliseo Stefano Maini1 | Luigi Manfredi1| Cecilia Laschi1 | Paolo Dario1</authors><title>Bioinspired velocity control of fast gaze shifts on a robotic anthropomorphic head      </title><content>         In this paper we address the problem of executing fast gaze shifts toward a visual target with a robotic platform. The robotic         platform is an anthropomorphic head with seven degrees of freedom (DOFs) that was designed to mimic the physical dimensions         (i.e. geometry and masses), the performances (i.e. angles and velocities) and the functional abilities (i.e. neck-movements         and eyes vergence) of the human head. In our approach the &amp;#8220;gold performance&amp;#8221; of the robotic head is represented by the accurate         eye-head coordination that is observed during head-free gaze saccades in humans.                                             To this aim, we implemented and tested on the robotic head a well-characterized, biologically inspired model of gaze control               and we investigate the effectiveness of the bioinspired paradigm to achieve an appropriate control of the multi-DOF robotic               head. Moreover, in order to verify if the proposed model can reproduce the typical patterns of actual human movements, we               performed a quantitative investigation of the relation between movement amplitude, duration and peak velocity. In the latter               case, we compared the actual robot performances with existing data on human main sequence which is known to provide a general               method for quantifying the dynamic of oculomotor control. The obtained results confirmed (1) the ability of the proposed bioinspired               control to achieve and maintain and stable fixation of the target which was always well-positioned within the fovea and (2) the ability to reproduce the               typical human main sequence diagrams which were never been successfully implemented on a fully anthropomorphic head.                           </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Bruce A.

In this article we address the problem of controlling the non-steady         state swimming and crawling of a novel fish robot. For this, we have designed a control architecture based on a central pattern         generator (CPG) implemented as a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators. The CPG, like its biological counterpart, can produce         coordinated patterns of rhythmic activity while being modulated by simple control parameters.                                             To test our controller, we designed BoxyBot, a simple fish robot with three actuated fins capable of swimming in water and               crawling on firm ground. Using the CPG model, the robot is capable of performing and switching between a variety of different               locomotor behaviors such as swimming forwards, swimming backwards, turning, rolling, moving upwards/downwards, and crawling.               These behaviors are triggered and modulated by sensory input provided by light, water, and touch sensors. Results are presented               demonstrating the agility of the robot and interesting properties of a CPG-based control approach such as stability of the               rhythmic patterns due to limit cycle behavior, and the production of smooth trajectories despite abrupt changes of control               parameters.                           </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>E.

The result has been very slow robots prone to tumble down in the presence of perturbations. This paper proposes a novel         gait-adaptation method based on the maximization of the Normalized Dynamic Energy Stability Margin. This method enables walking-machine         gaits to adapt to internal (robot dynamics) and external (environmental) perturbations, including the slope of the terrain,         by finding the gait parameters that maximize robot stability. The adaptation method is inspired in the natural gait adaptation         carried out by humans and animals to balance external forces or the effect of sloping terrain. Experiments with the SILO4         quadruped robot are presented and show how robot stability is more robust when the proposed approach is used for different         external forces and sloping terrains. Using the proposed gait-adaptation approach the robot is able to withstand external         forces up to 58% the robot weight and 25-degree slopes.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Jonathan Evans1 | Pedro PatrГіn1 | Ben Smith1  | David M.

The approach mixes both reactive and deliberative components. This provides the vehicle&amp;#8217;s behavior         designers with an explicit means to design-in avoidance strategies that match system requirements in concepts of operations         and for robot certification. The now traditional three layer architecture is extended to include a fourth Scenario layer,         where scripts describing specific responses are selected and parameterized on the fly. A;local map is maintained using available         sensor data, and adjacent objects are combined as they are observed. This has been observed to create safer trajectories.         Objects have persistence and fade if not re-observed over time. In common with behavior based approaches, a;reactive layer         is maintained containing pre-defined knee jerk responses for extreme situations. The reactive layer can inhibit outputs from         above. Path planning of updated goal point outputs from the Scenario layer is performed using a fast marching method made         more efficient through lifelong planning techniques. The architecture is applied to applications with Autonomous Underwater         Vehicles. Both simulated and open water tests are carried out to establish the performance and usefulness of the approach.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>David S.

The key         feature of the mechanical design is the use of two decoupled mechanisms in each axle, one to negotiate steps, and the other         to position the axle with respect to the chair to accommodate the overall slope. This design simplifies the control task substantially.         Kinematic models are necessary to describe the behavior of the system and to control the actuated degrees of freedom of the         wheelchair to ensure the passenger&amp;#8217;s comfort. The choice of a good climbing strategy simplifies the control and decreases         the power consumption of the wheelchair. In particular, we demonstrate that if the movement of the wheelchair has the same         slope as the racks or the same slope as the terrain that supports the wheel axles (depending on the configuration mechanism),         control is easier and power consumption is less. Experimental results are reported which show the behavior of the prototype         as it moves over different situations: (a) ascending a single step of different heights using different climbing strategies;         and (b) climbing a staircase using an appropriate climbing strategy that simplifies the control and reduces the power consumption         of the wheelchair.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Audrey Duquette1 | FranГ§ois Michaud2  | Henri Mercier1 </authors><title>Exploring the use of a mobile robot as an imitation agent with;children with low-functioning autism      </title><content>         Unpredictability and complexity of social interactions are important challenges for a low functioning autistic child.

However, real-time performance is commonly         gained by ignoring the robot shape and some or all of its kinematic restrictions which may lead to poor navigation performance         in many practical situations.

Our hypothesis is that hardware faults change         the flow of sensory data and the actions performed by the control program. By detecting these changes, the presence of faults         can be inferred. In order to test our hypothesis, we collect data from three different tasks performed by real robots. During         a number of training runs, we record sensory data from the robots while they are operating normally and after a fault has         been injected. We use back-propagation neural networks to synthesize fault detection components based on the data collected         in the training runs. We evaluate the performance of the trained fault detectors in terms of number of false positives and         time it takes to detect a fault. The results show that good fault detectors can be obtained. We extend the set of possible         faults and go on to show that a single fault detector can be trained to detect several faults in both a robot&amp;#8217;s sensors and         actuators. We show that fault detectors can be synthesized that are robust to variations in the task, and we show how a fault         detector can be trained to allow one robot to detect faults that occur in another robot.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Thomas Bock1 </authors><title>Guest editorial      </title><content>Without Abstract</content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Adriana Tapus1  | Maja J.

The proposal is based         on the information provided by static cameras located in the movement environment. This proposal falls within the scope of         what are known as intelligent environments; in this case, the environment is provided with cameras that, once calibrated,         allow the position of the robots to be obtained. Based on this information, control orders for the robots can be generated         using a radio frequency link. In order to facilitate identification of the robots, even under extremely adverse ambient lighting         conditions, a beacon consisting of four circular elements constructed from infrared diodes is mounted on board the robots.         In order to identify the beacon, an edge detection process is carried out. This is followed by a process that, based on the         algebraic distance, obtains the estimated ellipses associated with each element of the beacon. Once the beacon has been identified,         the coordinates of the centroids for the elements that make up the beacon are obtained on the various image planes. Based         on these coordinates, an algorithm is proposed that takes into account the standard deviation of the error produced in the         various cameras in ascertaining the coordinates of the beacon&amp;#8217;s elements. An odometric system is also used in guidance that,         in conjunction with a Kalman Filter, allows the position of the robot to be estimated during the time intervals required to         process the visual information provided by the cameras.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Anies Hannawati Purnamadjaja1  | R.

The         particular example of pheromone communication considered here was inspired by queen bee pheromones that have a number of crucial         functions in a bee colony, such as keeping together and stabilizing the colony. In the context of a robotic system, one of         the proposed applications for robot pheromones is to allow a group of robots to be guided by a robot leader. The robot leader         could release different chemicals to elicit a range of behaviors from other members of the group. A change of the operating         temperature of tin oxide gas sensors has been implemented in order to differentiate different chemicals. This paper provides         details of the robots used in the project and their behaviors. The sensors, especially the method of using the tin oxide gas         sensors, the robot control algorithms and experimental results are presented. In this project, pheromones were used to trigger         congregating behavior and light seeking in a group of robots.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Takayuki K|a1 | Shogo Nabe1| 2| Kazuo Hiraki1| 2| Hiroshi Ishiguro1| 3 | Norihiro Hagita1</authors><title>Human friendship estimation model for communication robots      </title><content>         Based on the analysis of non-verbal inter-human interaction, this paper proposes a model for estimating human friendships         in the presence of a humanoid robot. Our previous study in an elementary school provided rich video data of two months of         inter-human interaction in the presence of a humanoid robot. Such data are particularly useful for developing a robot&amp;#8217;s social         ability: a friendship estimation capability. We analyzed the video based on an observation method to analyze the interaction         among children and the robot. From their non-verbal interactions, several important factors for friendship estimation were         retrieved, including touch, gaze, co-presence, and distance. Gender was also considered a factor in the model, since gender         differences were observed in non-verbal interactions. The model discriminated between friendly and non-friendly relationships         among the children with 74.5% accuracy for boys and 83.8% for girls.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Matthew L.

Typically such systems employ carefully calibrated stereo cameras and carefully calibrated manipulators         to achieve precision on the order of ten millimeters with respect to instrument placement activities. The environmental and         functional restrictions under which these systems are used limit the operational accuracy of these approaches. This paper         presents a;novel approach to stereo-based manipulation designed to robustly achieve high precision levels despite the aforementioned         limitations. The basic principle of the approach, known as Hybrid Image Plane/Stereo (HIPS) Manipulation, is the generation         of camera models through direct visual sensing of the manipulator&amp;#8217;s end-effector. The HIPS method estimates and subsequently         uses these models to position the manipulator at a;target location specified in the image-planes of a;stereo camera pair using         stereo correlation and triangulation. In-situ estimation and adaptation of the manipulator/camera models in this method accounts         for changes in the system configuration, thus ensuring consistent precision for the life of the mission. The end result is         a;increase in positioning precision by a;factor of approximately two for a;limited version of HIPS, and an order of magnitude         increase in positioning precision for the full on-line version of HIPS.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>P.

However, walking robots still need further improvement if they are to compete with traditional vehicles. A potential improvement         could be made through optimization at design time. A better distribution of the legs around a robot&amp;#8217;s body can help decrease         actuator size in the design procedure and reduce power consumption during walking as well, which is of vital importance in         autonomous robots. This paper, thus, presents a method focused on the distribution of legs around the body to decrease maximum         foot forces against the ground, which play heavily in determining robot shape and actuator size. Some experiments have been         performed with the SILO6 walking robot to validate the theoretical results.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Hyun Do Choi1 | Chun Kyu Woo1 | Soohyun Kim1 | Yoon Keun Kwak1  | Sukjune Yoon2 </authors><title>Independent traction control for uneven terrain using stick-slip phenomenon: application to a stair climbing robot      </title><content>         Mobile robots are being developed for building inspection and security, military reconnaissance, and planetary exploration.         In such applications, the robot is expected to encounter rough terrain. In rough terrain, it is important for mobile robots         to maintain adequate traction as excessive wheel slip causes the robot to lose mobility or even be trapped. This paper proposes         a traction control algorithm that can be independently implemented to each wheel without requiring extra sensors and devices         compared with standard velocity control methods. The algorithm estimates the stick-slip of the wheels based on estimation         of angular acceleration. Thus, the traction force induced by torque of wheel converses between the maximum static friction         and kinetic friction. Simulations and experiments are performed to validate the algorithm. The proposed traction control algorithm         yielded a 40.5% reduction of total slip distance and 25.6% reduction of power consumption compared with the standard velocity         control method. Furthermore, the algorithm does not require a complex wheel-soil interaction model or optimization of robot         kinematics.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Paul E.

Such robots usually make use of a set of sensors to investigate         the terrain around them and build up an internal representation that enables them to navigate. This paper addresses the question         of how to use sensor data to learn properties of the environment and use this knowledge to predict which regions of the environment         are traversable. The approach makes use of sensed information from range sensors (stereo or ladar), color cameras, and the         vehicle&amp;#8217;s navigation sensors. Models of terrain regions are learned from subsets of pixels that are selected by projection         into a local occupancy grid. The models include color and texture as well as traversability information obtained from an analysis         of the range data associated with the pixels. The models are learned without supervision, deriving their properties from the         geometry and the appearance of the scene.                                             The models are used to classify color images and assign traversability costs to regions. The classification does not use the               range or position information, but only color images. Traversability determined during the model-building phase is stored               in the models. This enables classification of regions beyond the range of stereo or ladar using the information in the color               images. The paper describes how the models are constructed and maintained, how they are used to classify image regions, and               how the system adapts to changing environments. Examples are shown from the implementation of this algorithm in the DARPA               Learning Applied to Ground Robots (LAGR) program, and an evaluation of the algorithm against human-provided ground truth is               presented.                           </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Gianluca Antonelli1  | Stefano Chiaverini1 </authors><title>Linear estimation of the physical odometric parameters for differential-drive mobile robots      </title><content>         In this paper a calibration technique aimed at identifying the odometric parameters of differential-drive mobile robots is         proposed. The algorithm is based on two successive least-squares estimations based on the continuous-time kinematic equations         of motion; the time-discretization error, thus, is avoided. The use of the least-squares technique is made possible by working         on a linear mapping between the unknowns and the measurements and is not the result of a linearization. Another advantage         of the proposed technique is that no specific path is required. The basic technique makes use of video-camera measurements         and absolute position readings of the wheels&amp;#8217; encoders; the use of different sensors and measurements of the wheels velocities         is also discussed.

Most existing visual SLAM has been limited to the feature-based method         and only a few researchers have proposed visual SLAM methods for building a grid map using a stereo vision system which has         not been popular in practical application. In this paper, we estimate the planar depth by applying a simple visual sonar ranging         technique to the single camera image and then associating sequential scans through our own pseudo dense adaptive scan matching         algorithm reducing the processing time compared to the standard point-to-point correspondence based algorithm and finally         produce a grid map. To this end, we construct a Pseudo Dense Scan (PDS) which is an odometry based temporal accumulation of         the visual sonar readings emulating omni-directional sensing in order to overcome the sparseness of the visual sonar. Moreover,         in order to obtain a much more refined map, we further correct the slight trajectory error incurred in the PDS construction         step using Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) which is a well-known optimization scheme. Experimental results show that         our method can obtain an accurate grid map using a single camera without the need for a high price range sensors or stereo         camera.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Wolfgang HГјbner1  | Hanspeter A. Mallot1 </authors><title>Metric embedding of view-graphs         A vision and odometry-based approach to cognitive mapping</title><content>         Most recent robotic systems, capable of exploring unknown environments, use topological structures (graphs) as a spatial representation.         Localization can be done by deriving an estimate of the global pose from landmark information. In this case navigation is         tightly coupled to metric knowledge, and hence the derived control method is mainly pose-based. Alternative to continuous         metric localization, it is also possible to base localization methods on weaker constraints, e.g. the similarity between images         capturing the appearance of places or landmarks. In this case navigation can be controlled by a homing algorithm. Similarity         based localization can be scaled to continuous metric localization by adding additional constraints, such as alignment of         depth estimates.                                             We present a method to scale a similarity based navigation system (the view-graph-model) to continuous metric localization.               Instead of changing the landmark model, we embed the graph into the three dimensional pose space. Therefore, recalibration               of the path integrator is only possible at discrete locations in the environment. The navigation behavior of the robot is               controlled by a homing algorithm which combines three local navigation capabilities, obstacle avoidance, path integration,               and scene based homing. This homing scheme allows automated adaptation to the environment. It is further used to compensate               for path integration errors, and therefore allows to derive globally consistent pose estimates based on &amp;#8220;weak&amp;#8221; metric knowledge,               i.e. knowledge solely derived from odometry. The system performance is tested with a robotic setup and with a simulated agent               which explores a large, open, and cluttered environment.                           </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Seung Yeol Lee1 | Yong Seok Lee2 | Bum Seok Park3 | Sang Heon Lee4  | Chang Soo Han1 </authors><title>MFR (Multipurpose Field Robot) for installing construction materials      </title><content>The objective of the study was to propose a MFR (Multipurpose Field Robot) in hazardous operation environments.

The number of eldercare         clients is expected to grow dramatically over the next decade as the baby boom generation approaches 65 years of age. The         UMass/Smith ASSIST framework aims to alleviate the strain on centralized medical providers and community services as their         clientele grow, reduce the delays in service, support independent living, and therefore, improve the quality of life for the         up-coming elder population. We propose a closed loop methodology wherein innovative technical systems are field tested in         assisted care facilities and analyzed by social scientists to create and refine residential systems for independent living.         Our goal is to create technology that is embraced by clients, supports efficient delivery of support services, and facilitates         social interactions with family and friends. We introduce a series of technologies that are currently under evaluation based         on a distributed sensor network and a unique mobile manipulator (MM) concept. The mobile manipulator provides client services         and serves as an embodied interface for remote service providers. As a result, a wide range of cost-effective eldercare applications         can be devised, several of which are introduced in this paper. We illustrate tools for social interfaces, interfaces for community         service and medical providers, and the capacity for autonomous assistance in the activities of daily living. These projects         and others are being considered for field testing in the next cycle of ASSIST technology development.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Yuan F. Zheng1  | Weidong Chen2</authors><title>Mobile robot team forming for crystallization of proteins      </title><content>         The process of protein crystallization is explained using the theory of robotics, particularly path planning of mobile robots. Path planning is a procedure which specifies motion trajectories of multiple mobile robots to form a robotic         team with a desired pattern. Since protein crystals consist of a large number of protein molecules which come together to         form a 3D lattice of uniform structure, it is hypothesized that each protein behaves like a mobile robot and takes adequate         path to form a robotic team (crystal). Based on this hypothesis, it is shown that trajectories of the proteins should be simple and local, which generates three rules of motion for the protein robots, i.e., (a) each protein searches for its nearest neighbor,         (b) each protein takes the shortest path to approach the nearest neighbor, and (c) multiple proteins may form a sub-team of         proteins. It is then proven mathematically that the planned path according to the three rules is stable and able to crystallize         the proteins. Interaction forces at the molecular level are analyzed to show that the simple and local motion of the proteins         is physically warranted. Computer simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the new theory.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Andrea Carbone1 | Alberto Finzi2 | Andrea Orl|ini3  | Fiora Pirri1 </authors><title>Model-based control architecture for attentive robots in;rescue;scenarios      </title><content>         In this paper we present a control architecture for an autonomous rescue robot specialized in victim finding in an unknown         and unstructured environment. The reference domain for rescue robots is the rescue-world arenas purposefully arranged for         the Robocup competitions. The main task of a rescue mobile robot is to explore the environment and report to the rescue-operators         the map of visited areas annotated with its finding. In this context all the attentional activities play a major role in decision         processes: salient elements in the environment yield utilities and objectives. A;model-based executive controller is proposed         to coordinate, integrate, and monitor the distributed decisions and initiatives emerging from the modules involved in the         control loop. We show how this architecture integrates the reactive model-based control of a rescue mission, with an attentive         perceptual activity processing the sensor and visual stimuli. The architecture has been implemented and tested in real-world         experiments by comparing the performances of metric exploration and attentive exploration.

Positioning error can be caused by         many factors stemming from the robot&amp;#8217;s hardware and software configurations and the interaction between the robot and its         environment. A slip motion model that captures the effects of key factors that contribute to positioning error is presented.         Robot kinematic models with and without slippage are reformulated and used to perform an in-depth assessment and characterization         of positioning error. The method is applied to three characteristic advance and steering configurations: Ackermann, articulated,         and explicitly steered. This analysis serves as a quantitative evaluation of the properties of the steering geometries for         path tracking under identical slippage conditions. The method can also be used as a tool for comparing robot configurations         to make trade-off decisions early in the design process, as it allows for derivation of predicted performance values of alternative         steering geometries.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Paolo Arena1 | Sebastiano De Fiore1 | Luigi Fortuna1 | Mattia Frasca1 | Luca PatanГ©1  | Guido Vagliasindi1 </authors><title>Reactive navigation through multiscroll systems: from theory to;real-time implementation      </title><content>         In this paper a new reactive layer for multi-sensory integration applied to robot navigation is proposed.

To operate in the real world, autonomous robots rely on sensory information. Despite the potential richness         of visual information from on-board cameras, many mobile robots continue to rely on non-visual sensors such as tactile sensors,         sonar, and laser. This preference for relatively low-fidelity sensors can be attributed to, among other things, the characteristic         requirement of real-time operation under limited computational resources. Illumination changes pose another big challenge.         For true extended autonomy, an agent must be able to recognize for itself when to abandon its current model in favor of learning a;new one; and how to learn in its current situation. We describe a;self-contained vision system that works on-board a;vision-based autonomous         robot under varying illumination conditions. First, we present a;baseline system capable of color segmentation and object         recognition within the computational and memory constraints of the robot. This relies on manually labeled data and operates under constant and reasonably uniform illumination conditions. We then relax these limitations by introducing algorithms for (i);Autonomous         planned color learning, where the robot uses the knowledge of its environment (position, size and shape of objects) to automatically         generate a;suitable motion sequence and learn the desired colors, and (ii);Illumination change detection and adaptation, where         the robot recognizes for itself when the illumination conditions have changed sufficiently to warrant revising its knowledge         of colors. Our algorithms are fully implemented and tested on the Sony ERS-7 Aibo robots.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>T. Schmickl1  | K. Crailsheim1 </authors><title>Trophallaxis within a robotic swarm: bio-inspired communication among robots in a swarm      </title><content>         This article presents a bio-inspired communication strategy for large-scale robotic swarms. The strategy is based purely on         robot-to-robot interactions without any central unit of communication. Thus, the emerging swarm regulates itself in a purely         self-organized way. The strategy is biologically inspired by the trophallactic behavior (mouth-to-mouth feedings) performed         by social insects. We show how this strategy can be used in a collective foraging scenario and how the efficiency of this         strategy can be shaped by evolutionary computation. Although the algorithm works stable enough that it can be easily parameterized         by hand, we found that artificial evolution could further increase the efficiency of the swarm&amp;#8217;s behavior. We investigated         the suggested communication strategy by simulation of robotic swarms in several arena scenarios and studied the properties         of some of the emergent collective decisions made by the robots. We found that our control algorithm led to a nonlinear, but         graduated path selection of the emerging trail of loaded robots. They favored the shortest path, but not all robots converged         to this trail, except in arena setups with extreme differences in the length of the two possible paths. Finally, we demonstrate         how the flexibility of collective decisions that arise through this new strategy can be used in changing environments. We         furthermore show the importance of a negative feedback in an environment with changing foraging targets. Such feedback loops         allow outdated information to decay over time. We found that task efficiency is constrained by a lower and an upper boundary         concerning the strength of this negative feedback.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Arnaud ClГ©rentin1 | MГ©lanie Delafosse1 | Laurent Delahoche1 | Bruno Marhic1  | Anne-Marie Jolly-Desodt2 </authors><title>Uncertainty and imprecision modeling for the mobile robot localization;problem      </title><content>         This article deals with uncertainty and imprecision treatment during the mobile robot localization process. The imprecision         determination is based on the use of the interval formalism. Indeed, the mobile robot is equipped with an exteroceptive sensor         and odometers. The imprecise data given by these two sensors are fused by constraint propagation on intervals. At the end         of the algorithm, we get 3D localization subpaving which is supposed to contain the robot&amp;#8217;s position in a guaranteed way.         Concerning the uncertainty, it is managed through a propagation architecture based on the use of the Transferable Belief Model         of Smets. This architecture enables to propagate uncertainty from low level data (sensor data) in order to quantify the global         uncertainty of the robot localization estimation.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Eric Demeester1 | Alex|er HГјntemann1| Dirk Vanhooydonck1| Gerolf Vanacker1| Hendrik Van Brussel1 | Marnix Nuttin1</authors><title>User-adapted plan recognition and user-adapted shared control: A Bayesian approach to semi-autonomous wheelchair driving      </title><content>         Many elderly and physically impaired people experience difficulties when maneuvering a powered wheelchair. In order to ease         maneuvering, powered wheelchairs have been equipped with sensors, additional computing power and intelligence by various research         groups.                                             This paper presents a Bayesian approach to maneuvering assistance for wheelchair driving, which can be adapted to a specific               user. The proposed framework is able to model and estimate even complex user intents, i.e. wheelchair maneuvers that the driver               has in mind. Furthermore, it explicitly takes the uncertainty on the user&amp;#8217;s intent into account. Besides during intent estimation,               user-specific properties and uncertainty on the user&amp;#8217;s intent are incorporated when taking assistive actions, such that assistance               is tailored to the user&amp;#8217;s driving skills. This decision making is modeled as a greedy Partially Observable Markov Decision               Process (POMDP).                           </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Marjorie Skubic1 | Derek Anderson1| Samuel Blisard1| Dennis Perzanowski2 | Alan Schultz2</authors><title>Using a hand-drawn sketch to control a team of robots      </title><content>In this paper, we describe a prototype interface that facilitates the control of a mobile robot team by a single operator,         using a sketch interface on a Tablet PC.

The motion planning is based on a vision vector space (V2-Space), which is a unitary vector set that represents local collision-free directions in the image coordinate system. The         V2-Space is constructed by extracting the vectors based on the similarity of adjacent pixels, which captures both the color         information and the directional information from prior vehicle tire tracks and pedestrian footsteps. We report how the V2-Space is constructed to reduce the impact of varying lighting conditions in outdoor environments. We also show how the V2-Space can be used to incorporate vehicle kinematic, dynamic, and time-delay constraints in motion planning to fit the highly         dynamic requirements of the motorcycle. The combined algorithm of the V2-Space construction and the motion planning runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of pixels in the captured image. Experiments show that our algorithm outputs correct robot motion commands         more than 90% of the time.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Ralf MГ¶ller1 | Andrew Vardy2| Sven Kreft1 | Sebastian Ruwisch1</authors><title>Visual homing in environments with anisotropic landmark distribution      </title><content>         Gradient descent in image distances can lead a navigating agent to the goal location, but in environments with an anisotropic         distribution of landmarks, gradient home vectors deviate from the true home direction. These deviations can be reduced by         applying Newton&amp;#8217;s method to matched-filter descent in image distances (MFDID). Based on several image databases we demonstrate         that the home vectors produced by the Newton-based MFDID method are usually closer to the true home direction than those obtained         from the original MFDID method. The greater accuracy of Newton-MFDID home vectors in the vicinity of the goal location would         allow a navigating agent to approach the goal on straighter trajectories, improve the results of triangulation procedures,         and enhance a robot&amp;#8217;s ability to detect its arrival at a goal.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Xiuli Zhang1  | Haojun Zheng2 </authors><title>Walking up and down hill with a biologically-inspired postural reflex in a quadrupedal robot      </title><content>         This paper presents a control strategy, biologically-inspired postural reflex, based directly on animal behaviors, which allows         a quadrupedal robot to walk up and down hill smoothly. A central pattern generator (CPG) and a hip-to-knee mapping function         are employed to realize the basic rhythmic motion for the quadrupedal robot. The trunk pitch angle feedback of the robot is         linearly introduced to the CPG, spontaneously changing the mid-positions of the four legs to make postural adjustments as         the way a cat does. Thereby, slipping and falling-down are greatly reduced. Numerical simulations and experimental implementation         on a physical quadrupedal robot demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.               </content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>tefan Havl&amp;Iacute k1 </authors><title>A Modular Concept of the Robotic Vehicle for Demining Operations</title><content>Paper analyses some most important characteristics that should be taken into consideration in building the robotic demining vehicle.

One of the main applications of these robots is to perform care tasks in indoor environments such as houses, nursing homes or hospitals, and therefore they need to be able to navigate robustly for long periods of time. This paper focuses on the navigation system of SIRA, a robotic assistant for elderly and/or blind people based on a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) to global localize the robot and to direct its goal-oriented actions. The main novel feature of our approach is that it combines sonar and visual information in a natural way to produce state transitions and observations in the framework of Markov Decision Processes. Besides this multisensorial fusion, a two-level layered planning architecture that combines several planning objectives (such as guiding to a goal room and reducing locational uncertainty) improves the robustness of the navigation system, as its shown in our experiments with SIRA navigating corridors.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>A New Approach to Humanitarian DeminingPart 1: Mobile Platform for Operation on Unstructured Terrain</authors><title>Landmines can deprive whole areas of valuable resources, and continue to kill and cause injuries years after the end of armed conflicts. Armored vehicles are used for mine clearance, but with limited reliability. The final inspection of minefields is still performed by human deminers exposed to potentially fatal accidents. The aim of this research is to introduce automation as a way to improve the final level of humanitarian demining. This paper addresses mobility and manipulation, while sensing, communication and visualization shall be discussed in detail in a subsequent paper. After analyzing the merits and limitations of previous works, a new approach to tele-operated demining is considered, using off-road buggies equipped with combustion engines, and taking into account actual field requirements. Control of the automated buggies on rough terrain is also discussed, as well as the development of a new weight-balanced manipulator for landmine clearance operations.</title><content/></document></documents>
