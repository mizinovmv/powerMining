Title: Integration of battlefield visualization and agent technology
Abstract: There are several significant and related automation trends in the  evolution of the tactical battlefield, necessary to support greatly  increased mobility of our land forces.  One relates to the increased  automation and distributed functionality of the nerve center or  tactical operation center (TOC), with the introduction of  intelligent software agents.  The anticipated dynamics of the future  battlefield will require greatly increased mobility, information  flow, information assimilation, and decision action of these  centers.  The second relates to the digitization of battlefield  platforms.  This digitization greatly reduces the uncertainty  concerning these platforms and enables automated information  exchange between these platforms and their tactical operation center (TOC).  The third is the rapid development of robotic or physical  agents for numerous hazardous battlefield tasks such as clearing  buildings, or acting as scouts for a future objective force.  This  paper attempts to illustrate the importance of battlefield  visualization to exploit the potential synergy and unification of  these disparate developments.  Battlefield visualization programs are currently focussed on effectively representing the physical  environment to support planning, mission rehearsal, and situational  awareness.  As intelligent agents (software and physical) are  developed, battlefield visualization must be enhanced to include the state, behavior, collaboration and results of these agents.  An  initial representation of software and physical agents within a  single battlefield visualization is presented.  The major challenges  to attaining this level of automation, in particular human  interaction and trust will be addressed.  12 Refs.

Title: Defining a fusion gain - System operation characteristic (SOC) curve  based on probability of detection and probability of false alarms
Abstract: One issue that concerns the data fusion community is whether or not  fusion of sensory information is beneficial.  Beneficial results from fusion can be understood from a logical argument that if two types  of sensors are measuring an object and only one source is available, then fusion is beneficial.  Such an argument holds in the case of  person identification system with the fusion of audio and video  information.  If only video is available, then a system comprising of audio alone could not identify the person.  We further refine the  fusion benefit to assess what is the measure of fusion gain ? A  fusion gain system operator characteristic (FG-SOC) metric and a  system reliability (SR) metric are use to define a fusion gain.  A  multi-source data fusion system performance modeling gain directly  addresses both system performance and data sufficiency using system  simulation and functional modeling methods.  The FG-SOC approach  models the relationships between sensor performance, revisit rate,  and object density by extending current statistical tracking  performance models to asynchronous sensing situations.  The FG-SCO  application establishes a method for the relative comparison of  multiple sensor collection alternatives using a functional  performance characterization and can be used to evaluate sensor  fusion planning and control alternatives based on fusion system  performance.  21 Refs.

Title: Hierarchical adaptation scheme for multi-agent data fusion and  resource management in situation analysis
Abstract: Sensor Management (SM) has to do with how to best manage, coordinate  and organize the use of sensing resources in a manner that  synergistically improves the process of data fusion.  Based on the  contextual information, SM develops options for collecting further  information, allocates and directs the sensors towards the  achievement of the mission goals and/or tunes the parameters for the real-time improvement of the effectiveness of the sensing process.   Conscious of the important role that SM has to play in modern data  fusion systems, we are currently studying advanced SM concepts that  would help increase the survivability of the current Halifax and  Iroquois Class ships, as well as their possible future upgrades.  For this purpose, a hierarchical scheme has been proposed for data  fusion and resource management adaptation, based on the control  theory and within the process refinement paradigm of the JDL data  fusion model, and taking into account the multi-agent model put  forward by the SASS Group for the situation analysis process.  The  novelty of this work lies in the unified framework that has been  defined for tackling the adaptation of both the fusion process and  the sensor/weapon management.  17 Refs.

Title: Avoiding global congestion using decentralized adaptive agents
Abstract: Everyone wants to go to a bar called El Farol if it is not crowded  but would rather stay home if it is.  Unfortunately, the only way to  know whether or not the bar is crowded is to go.  While such a  scenario appears far removed from the typical communications  literature, it provides a simple paradigm for analyzing public goods like the Internet, which may simultaneously suffer from congestion  and coordination problems, e.g., multiple users trying to connect to the same server or to use the same resource simultaneously.  This  paper reviews previous solutions to the El Farol Santa Fe bar  problem, which typically involve complex learning algorithms.  A  simple adaptive strategy similar to many signal processing  algorithms such as LMS and its signed variants is proposed.  The  strategy is investigated via simulation, and the algorithm is  analyzed in a few simple cases.  Unlike most signal processing  applications, the objective of the adaptation is not fast and  accurate parameter estimation but rather the achievement of a degree of global coordination among users.  20 Refs.

Title: Nongovernance rather than governance in a multiagent economic society
Abstract: This paper explores how to achieve goals at the macro level without  controlling self-interested economic agents at the micro level and  investigates the effectiveness of our claim suggesting that we make  use of properties arising from interaction among economic agents to  address the above issue.  Intensive experiments on a complex domain  problem have found the following implications: 1) as an institution  design, it is important not to control economic agents at the micro  level, but to promote them to self-activate in order to achieve  goals at the macro level and 2) as a role of an administrative party like a government, it is important to have a clear view to determine which results are good because the timing for finding such results  depends on the environmental situation and there is no guarantee  that these results will converge.  Other implications are summarized  as follows: 1) it is important to remove evaluation level  intervention to find good results, while it is important to  introduce this intervention to reduce costs and 2) behaviour  intervention does not contribute to finding good results nor  reducing costs.  15 Refs.

Title: Phase transition in a Foreign Exchange Market - Analysis based on an  artificial market approach
Abstract: In this study, we propose an artificial market approach, which is a  new agent-based approach to foreign exchange market studies.  Using  this approach, emergent phenomena of markets such as the peaked and  fat-tailed distribution of rate changes were explained.  First, we  collected the field data through interviews and questionnaires with  dealers and found that the features of dealer interaction in  learning were similar to the features of genetic operations in  biology.  Second, we constructed an artificial market model using a  genetic algorithm.  Our model was a multiagent system with agents  having internal representations about market situations.  Finally, we carried out computer simulations with our model using the actual  data series of economic fundamentals and political news.  We then  identified three emergent phenomena of the market.  As a result, we  concluded that these emergent phenomena could be explained by the  phase transition of forecast variety, which is due to the  interaction of agent forecasts and the demand-supply balance.  In  addition, the results of simulation were compared with the field  data.  The field data supported the simulation results.  This approach therefore integrates fieldwork and a multiagent model, and provides  a quantitative explanation of micro-macro relations in markets.  18  Refs.

Title: Cooperation models for acquiring knowledge in multi-agent systems
Abstract: Knowledge is the precondition for an agent to compute.  In dynamic and non-deterministic multi-agent systems, agent should be able to  acquire the knowledge timely and effectively so as to solve the  problems.  The existing knowledge-acquiring models can't meet the  knowledge-acquiring requirements in dynamic and non-deterministic  multi-agent system and the agent's capability of acquiring knowledge is limited.  The systematic knowledge-acquired cooperation models  (KACM) is presented for agent to effectively acquire knowledge in  multi-agent systems, including passive model, active terminating  model and active non-terminating model.  Based on the speech act  theory and a formal framework of branch temporal logic, the  communication acts in KACM are discussed, how agent responses to the communication acts is investigated, the rigorous semantics of the  speech acts and the KACM are defined, and lastly the significance of the research is presented.  6 Refs.

Title: Towards a multi-agent model for visualizing simulated user behavior  to support the assessment of design performance
Abstract: We introduce the outline of a multi-agent model that can be used for  visualizing simulated user behavior to support the assessment of  design performance.  We will consider various performance indicators  of building environments, which are related to user reaction to  design decisions.  This system may serve as a media tool in the  design process for a better understanding of what the design will  look like, especially for those cases where design or planning  decisions will affect the behavior of individuals.  The system is  based on cellular automata and multi-agent simulation technology.   The system simulates how agents move around in a particular 3D (or  2D) environment, in which space is represented as a lattice of  cells.  Agents represent objects or people with their own behavior,  moving over the network.  Each agent will be located in a simulated  space, based on the cellular automata grid.  Each iteration of the  simulation is based on a parallel update of the agents conforming  local rules.  Agents positioned within an environment will need  sensors to perceive their local neighborhood and some means with  which to affect the environment.  In this way, autonomous individuals and the interaction between them can be simulated by the system.  As  a result, designers can use the system to assess the likely  consequences of their design decisions on user behavior.  We think  that the system provides a potentially valuable tool to support  design and decision-making processes, related to user behavior in  architecture and urban planning. copy 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: A multi-agent intelligent system for efficient ERP maintenance
Abstract: The Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is an enterprise-wide  integrated software package designed to uphold the highest quality  standards of business process.  However, for the time being, when the business condition has been changed, the system may not guarantee  that the process embedded in ERP is still best.  Moreover, since the  ERP system is very complex, maintaining the system by trial and  error is very costly.  Hence, this paper aims to construct a support  system that adjusts ERP system to environmental changes.  To do so,  we adopt multi-agent intelligent technology that enables autonomous  cooperation with one another to monitor ERP databases and to find  any exceptional changes and then analyze how the changes will affect ERP performance.  Moreover, Petri net is applied to manage the  complexity and dynamics of agents' behavior.  To show the feasibility of the idea, a prototype agent system, ERP/PN, is proposed and an  experiment is conducted. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.  All rights  reserved.  43 Refs.

Title: Power laws of wealth, market order volumes and market returns
Abstract: Using the Generalized Lotka Volterra model adapted to deal with  mutiagent systems we can investigate economic systems from a general viewpoint and obtain generic features common to most economies.   Assuming only weak generic assumptions on capital dynamics, we are  able to obtain very specific predictions for the distribution of  social wealth.  First, we show that in a 'fair' market, the wealth  distribution among individual investors fulfills a power law.  We  then argue that 'fair play' for capital and minimal socio-biological needs of the humans traps the economy within a power law wealth  distribution with a particular Pareto exponent alpha similar to 3/2.  In particular, we relate it to the average number of individuals L  depending on the average wealth: alpha similar to L/(L-1).  Then we  connect it to certain power exponents characterizing the stock  markets.  We find that the distribution of volumes of the individual  (buy and sell) orders follows a power law with similar exponent beta similar to alpha similar to 3/2.  Consequently, in a market where  trades take place by matching pairs of such sell and buy orders, the corresponding exponent for the market returns is expected to be of  order gamma similar to 2alpha similar to 3. These results are  consistent with recent experimental measurements of these power law  exponents (S.  Maslov, M. Mills, Physica A 299 (2001) 234 for beta P. Gopikrishnan et al., Phys.  Rev.  E 60 (1999) 5305 for gamma). copy  2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  35 Refs.

Title: Dynamic objects to support evolution of mobile agents
Abstract: The self-modifiability or evolvability is necessary for mobile agents to navigate over network changing unpredictably and continuously.  We propose an approach to the evolution of mobile agents based on  dynamic objects capable of being attached to, interpreted by,  carried with, exchanged among, and structured by the agents.  We have implemented such objects on the MESSENGERS mobile-agents system, and have coded a distributed task coordination as an application  example.  This paper presents the implementation and benefits of our  approach to the agent evolution.  6 Refs.

This paper presents the design and implementation of a  multi-access and multi-functional auction system.  Users can access  the auction system through the Web, WAP-enabled devices and agents,  particularly mobile agents.  The auction system supports different  types of auctions, including English auction, Dutch auction, Yankee  auction, Sealed Bid auction and Double auction.  In particular, we  discuss the mobile agent-based approach in detail by presenting the  protocol for implementing different types of auctions.  9 Refs.

Title: Realizing continuous and transparent service using agents
Abstract: Many peoples are using the Internet and many types of devices have  emerged.  In this situation, a single user wants to continue to work  in anytime and anywhere.  Current contents service targets specific  devices, so that it cannot support many different types of devices.   To realize continuous and transparent services, we propose a new  model of ASP.  In our proposed model, User Agent and Application  Agent can work together to provide service continuity and device  transparency.  Then, we implemented a prototype based on this model  and evaluated our model.  As a conclution, our model could provide  continuous and device transparent service.  5 Refs.

Title: A policy management system for collaborative applications
Abstract: In the Multimedia and Mobile Agent Research Laboratory an underway  work is conducted toward combining management policies and Mobile  Agents in the area of collaborative applications.  The goal is to  have a collaborative system thoroughly based on agents and highly  flexible and dynamically manageable through multi-level policies.   Towards this objective, we have designed a global framework to  support policies.  This framework is used to define, store and  evaluate policies defined through multiple levels of the  collaborative system.  Moreover, the policies are distributed  judiciously over the application.  This paper describes the Policy  Management System we have elaborated and illustrates its integration with the V-Team system.  12 Refs.

Title: A network approach to operate agile manufacturing systems
Abstract: This paper presents and illustrates a strategic framework for  designing and operating agile networked manufacturing systems.  This  framework allows to collaboratively plan, control and manage  day-to-day operations and contingencies in a dynamic environment.   The first section summarizes the NetMan organizational and  collaboration strategy.  It consists of a dynamic business method to  organize and operate manufacturing activities through the  configuration, activation and operation of a distributed network of  inter-dependent and responsible manufacturing centers.  Next, the  concepts underlying this strategic framework as well as the  technical implications of such an approach, are illustrated, using a detailed case study inspired by a motorcoach industrial partner.   copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract: Advanced manufacturing concepts such as CIM, "Concurrent  engineering", "Agile manufacturing" and "Virtual enterprise " have  emerged.  This article examines the main characteristics on which the Virtual enterprise (VE) structure depends, in accordance with  environmental constraints, production process and strategic  objectives.  The main types of VE and especially the Consortium VE  type are considered.  The primary concern with VE is the overall  control.  A distributed and non-hierarchic control structure for a  Consortium VE, allowing tasks distribution and product development  management, is proposed with a multi-agent system based solution  with self-organisation abilities. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Socially intelligent reasoning for autonomous agents
Abstract: Socially intelligent agents are autonomous problem solvers that have  to achieve their objectives by interacting with other similarly  autonomous entities.  A major concern, therefore, is with the design  of the decision-making mechanism that such agents employ in order to determine which actions to take to achieve their goals.  An  attractive and much sought after property of this mechanism is that  it produces decisions that are rational from the perspective of the  individual agent.  However, such agents are also inherently social.   Moreover, individual and social concerns often conflict, leading to  the possibility of inefficient performance of the individual and the system.  To address these problems we propose a framework for making  socially acceptable decisions, based on social welfare functions,  that combines social and individual perspectives in a unified and  flexible manner.  The framework is realized in an exemplar  computational setting and an empirical analysis is made of the  relative performance of varyingly sociable decision-making functions in a range of environments.  This analysis is then used to design an  agent that adapts its decision-making to reflect the resource  constraints that it faces at any given time.  A further round of  empirical evaluation shows how adding such a metalevel mechanism  enhances the performance of the agent by directing reasoning to  adopt different strategies in different contexts.  Finally, the  possibility and efficacy of making the metalevel mechanism adaptive, so that experience of past encounters can be factored into the  decision-making, is demonstrated.  28 Refs.

Title: Research and design of automatic abstracting systems based on  multiagent technologies
Abstract: To resolve the contradiction of domain currency and abstract quality  of automatic abstracting systems, we put forward the solution to  build automatic abstracting systems based on multiagent  technologies.  To build such systems, there are two key problems:  firstly, how many abstracting agents for each domain are suitable in some load; secondly, what coordination strategy should be used.  The  model of an automatic abstracting system based on multiagent  technologies is given, and three kinds of coordination algorithms  are set forth.  We analyze the performance of the system based on the simulations, and get suitable number of abstracting agents for each  domain in given load.

Title: Study of agent-based distributed hierarchical intelligent control
Abstract: According to the hierarchical structure of intelligent control  systems, the concept of distributed hierarchical intelligent control (DHIC) is presented by blending the factitious division of  hierarchical systems and the natural division of distributed control systems.  A multi-agent system (MAS) is constructed by taking agents  as intelligent controllers of DHIC.  In accordance with the  characteristic of DHIC, a dominant-subordinate mechanism is proposed to coordinate this kind of MAS.  The commonness of agents in the MAS  is analyzed and agent's compound structure and implementation scheme of the systems are expounded.  7 Refs.

Title: Holonic assembly system with Plug and Produce
Abstract: An assembly system based on holonic concept has been newly installed.  The system consists of three manipulators, one belt-conveyor and two warehouses.  The system assembles several parts into a product.  Its  sequences are planned by negotiation among the assembly devices by  means of contract net protocol.  Thus, even though the parts are  supplied at different warehouses, the system can generate a sequence of transportation automatically.  Utilizing the characteristics of  distributed autonomous systems, a new concept Plug and Produce is  proposed.  A device can be installed easily and then immediately  start to work.  This system has high robustness against the  reconfiguration and sudden changes of products.  Experiments were  made for two kinds of assembly tasks and verified the efficiency of  the system. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  7  Refs.

Title: Microscopic traffic simulation with reactive driving agents
Abstract: Computer traffic simulation is important for making new  traffic-control strategies.  Microscopic traffic simulators can model traffic flow in a realistic manner and are ideal for agent-based  vehicle control.  In this paper we describe a model of a reactive  agent that is used to control a simulated vehicle.  The agent is  capable of tactical-level driving and has different driving styles.   To ensure fast reaction times, the agent's driving task is divided  in several competing and reactive behavior rules.  The agent is  implemented in and tested with a prototype traffic simulator  program.  The simulator consists of an urban environment with  multi-lane roads, intersections, traffic lights, and vehicles.  Every vehicle is controlled by a driving agent and all agents have  individual behavior settings.  Preliminary experiments have shown  that the agents exhibit human-like behavior ranging from slow and  careful to fast and aggressive driving behavior.  11 Refs.

Title: Intelligent agents in decentralized traffic control
Abstract: A multi-agent decentralized strategy to control an urban traffic  network is presented.  Each agent is in charge of managing the  signals of an intersection.  Local feedback information about an  intersection state is obtained using lane sensors to implement an  adaptive strategy for each agent.  Cooperating behavior between  agents is achieved by exchanging information, called "opinions",  between adjacent agents to influence each other decisions.  Results  for this architecture are shown on a simulated environment modeling  an area of the city of Pittsburgh, PA, and comparisons are made with other methods.  8 Refs.

Title: Collaborative robot exploration and rendezvous: Algorithms,  performance bounds and observations
Abstract: We consider the problem of how two heterogeneous robots can arrange  to meet in an unknown environment from unknown starting locations:  that is, the problem of arranging a robot rendezvous.  We are  interested, in particular, in allowing two robots to rendezvous so  that they can collaboratively explore an unknown environment.   Specifically, we address the problem of how a pair of exploring  agents that cannot communicate with one another over long distances  can meet if they start exploring at different unknown locations in  an unknown environment.  We propose several alternative algorithms  that robots could use in attempting to rendezvous quickly while  continuing to explore.  These algorithms exemplify different classes  of strategy whose relative suitability depends on characteristics of the problem definition.  We consider the performance of our proposed  algorithms analytically with respect to both expected- and  worst-case behavior.  We then examine their behavior under a wider  set of conditions using both numerical analysis and also a  simulation of multi-agent exploration and rendezvous.  We examine the exploration speed, and show that a multi-robot system can explore an unknown environment faster than a single-agent system, even with the constraint of performing rendezvous to allow communication.  We  conclude with a demonstration of rendezvous implemented on a pair of actual robots.  29 Refs.

Title: Hyper-distributed hyper-parallel self-organizing dynamic scheduling  based on solitary wave
Abstract: This paper presents a new soliton approach to hyper-distributed  hyper-parallel self-organizing dynamic scheduling for task  allocations among rational autonomous agents in a multi-agent system (MAS).  This approach can overcome many drawbacks of other mechanisms currently used for coalition formation and cooperation in MAS.  The  thorny problems, such as overabundant bid, social behaviors, colony  intelligence, variable neighbors, and interdependency, can easily be treated by using the proposed approach, whereas they are very  difficult for other conventional approaches.  The simulation on a  distributed transport scheduling system shows the soliton approach  featured by hyper-parallelism, effectiveness, openness, dynamic  alignment and adaption.  9 Refs.

Title: Features based multi-agent distributed process planning methods
Abstract: The manufacturing industries are turning a way from heavy industry to service industry where orders are processed in small quantities and  are varying all the time.  This tendency leads to a virtual shop  floor that consists of several machining centers that are dispersed  on a shop floor.  This paper presents some basic concepts and  methods, uses agents relationship structure and feature connectivity architecture to cope with the particular problem for Distributed  Process Planning (DPP).  Feature connectivity aspects of a component  model are crucial in an application such as process planning.  In  developing the component process plans, the inheritance of features  is important for the machine tools and cutting tools selection.  This result in optimal process plans was presented.

Title: Using an extensible object-oriented query language in multibody  system analysis
Abstract: Since modern software tools produce large amounts of engineering  data, the demand for efficient data management may be met by  integrating database technology with engineering applications.  This  approach is taken in MECHAMOS, which is a previously reported system for symbolic and numeric multibody system (MBS) analysis.  This work  focuses on the high level analysis performed with the available  query language in MECHAMOS.  The data management is considerably  improved in this system compared to a traditional MBS analysis tool.  For instance, MECHAMOS can easily combine and compare MBS data not  only within the same MBS model but also over several MBS models,  each governing different equations of motion.  To avoid redundant  computations in such analyses a simplified materialisation mechanism is implemented.  Examples are given of combining and comparing both  symbolic and numeric MBS data. copy 2001 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  13 Refs.

Title: Spectroscopic detection of biological NO with a quantum cascade laser
Abstract: Two configurations of a continuous wave quantum cascade distributed  feedback laser-based gas sensor for the detection of NO at a parts  per billion (ppb) concentration level, typical of biomedical  applications, have been investigated.  The laser was operated at  liquid nitrogen temperature near lambda = 5.2 mum.  In the first  configuration, a 100m optical path length multi-pass cell was  employed to enhance the NO absorption.  In the second configuration,  a technique based on cavity-enhanced spectroscopy (CES) was  utilized, with an effective path length of 670 m. Both sensors  enabled simultaneous analysis of NO and CO//2 concentrations in  exhaled air.  The minimum detectable NO concentration was found to be 3 ppb with a multi-pass cell and 16 ppb when using CES.  The two  techniques are compared, and potential future developments are  discussed.  22 Refs.

Abstract: New forms of communication services that achieve richer  communications focused on a sense of "connection" called "Home  Communication Services (HCS)" have been proposed in terms of  broadband (high-speed access and continuous connection) service  creation.  This paper describes the concept of HCS, multiagent  technologies for supporting the formation of network communities,  and proposes two service models (for a family and a home-office)  that will be demonstrated through social tested in simulations of  real-life situations.  These services will allow richer conversations between people in remote locations separated by long distances and  will bring about a workstyle and lifestyle innovation.  24 Refs.

Title: Supply chain management with market economics
Abstract: Supply chain management (SCM) is now recognised as one of the best  means by which enterprises can make instant improvements to their  business strategies and operations.  SCM, however, is generally based on the simple theory of constraints (TOC) concept, and is not always concerned with Pareto optimal solutions in product distribution.   Since market price systems constitute a well-understood class of  mechanisms that under certain conditions provide effective  decentralisation of decision making with minimal communication  overhead, we propose SCM based on market-oriented programming in  this paper.  In market-oriented programming, we take a metaphor of  economy computing multi-agent behaviour literally, and directly  implement the distributed computation as a market price system.  We  define the agent activities to negotiate the tradeoffs of acquiring  different resources, so as to realise the multi-echelon  optimisation.  Several simulation experiments on the supply chain  model with multi-echelon structure clarify th e market dynamics that emerge through the agent negotiations.  It is confirmed that careful  constructions of the decision process according to economic  principles can lead to Pareto optimal resource allocations in SCM,  and the behaviour of the system can be analysed in economic terms.   copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Parallel simulation of a stochastic agent/environment interaction  model
Abstract: In this article, we address the modeling and simulation of situated  agents, together with the unreliability of their sensors and  effectors.  We propose a model for the simulation of the  agent/environment interaction, that integrates uncertainties and  errors of agent sensors and effectors.  This model is built upon a  stochastic modeling of the interaction.  We illustrate an application of such a model in the case of simulating a set of mobile autonomous robots evolving in a structured environment (the inside of a  building).  Moreover, the built simulator has been designed to be  executed on parallel computers and we describe its parallel  implementation together with major results from a simulation point  of view, as well as parallel performances.  30 Refs.

Title: Mobile agent security with the IPEditor development tool and the  mobile UNITY language
Abstract: Many people consider that security is one of the biggest problems for practical use of mobile agents that move around the network and do  their tasks.  In this paper, we assert that this issue can be  effectively managed by using IPEditor, the development support tool  of mobile multi-agent applications that we have been released, and  Mobile UNITY, a formal specification language of mobile agent  applications.  IPEditor helps developers to design applications with  visual supports of agent behaviors.  In our method, we translate an  IPEditor model to a Mobile UNITY program that is the formal  specification of the agent behaviors.  In addition, we describe the  security requirements by the Mobile UNITY logic notation.  Thus we  can verify the security requirements by proving that the mobile  UNITY program, therefore the IPEditor model, satisfies the mobile  UNITY logic notation.  We present an example of an electronic catalog (e-catalog) application and illustrate the effectiveness of our  proposal.  23 Refs.

Title: A knowledge level software engineering methodology for agent oriented programming
Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to introduce and motivate a methodology,  called Tropos, for building agent oriented software systems.  Tropos  is based on two key ideas.  First, the notion of agent and all the  related mentalistic notions (for instance: beliefs, goals, actions  and plans) are used in all phases of software development, from the  early analysis down to the actual implementation.  Second, Tropos  covers also the very early phases of requirements analysis, thus  allowing for a deeper understanding of the environment where the  software must operate, and of the kind of interactions that should  occur between software and human agents.  The methodology is  illustrated with the help of a case study.  21 Refs.

Title: Evaluation of modeling techniques for agent-based systems
Abstract: To develop agent-based systems, one needs a methodology that supports the development process as common in other disciplines.  In recent  years, several such methodologies and modeling techniques have been  suggested.  An important question is, to what extent do the existing  methodologies address the developers' needs.  In this paper we  attempt to answer this question.  In particular, we discuss  suitability of agent modeling techniques to agent-based systems  development.  In evaluating existing modeling techniques, we address  criteria from software engineering as well as characteristics of  agent-based systems.  Our evaluation shows that some aspects of  modeling techniques for agent-based systems may benefit from further enhancements.  As we show, these aspects include distribution,  concurrency, testing and communication richness.  We also find space  for (relatively small) improvements in aspects such as the refining  of the models throughout the development process and the coverage  and consistency checking of the s uggested models.  20 Refs.

Title: Communication decisions in multi-agent cooperation: Model and  experiments
Abstract: In multi-agent cooperation, agents share a common goal, which is  evaluated through a global utility function.  However, an agent  typically cannot observe the global state of an uncertain  environment, and therefore they must communicate with each other in  order to share the information needed for deciding which actions to  take.  We argue that, when communication incurs a cost (due to  resource consumption, for example), whether to communicate or not  also becomes a decision to make.  Hence, communication decision  becomes part of the overall agent decision problem.  In order to  explicitly address this problem, we present a multi-agent extension  to Markov decision processes in which communication can be modeled  as an explicit action that incurs a cost.  This framework provides a  foundation for a quantified study of agent coordination policies and provides both motivation and insight to the design of heuristic  approaches.  An example problem is studied under this framework.  From this example we can see the impact co mmunication policies have on  the overall agent policies, and what implications we can find toward the design of agent coordination policies.  16 Refs.

Title: Matchmaking among minimal agents without a facilitator
Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems are a promising way of dealing with large complex problems.  However, it is not yet clear just how much complexity or  pre-existing structure individual agents must have to allow them to  work together effectively.  In this paper, we ask to what extent  agents with minimal resources, local communication and without a  directory service can solve a consumer-provider matchmaking problem.  We are interested in finding a solution that is massively scalable  and can be used with resource poor agents in an open system.  We  create a model involving random search and a grouping procedure.   Through simulation of this model, we show that peer-to-peer  communication in a environment with multiple copies of randomly  distributed like clients and providers is sufficient for most agents to discover the service consumers or providers they need to complete tasks.  We simulate systems with between 500 and 32,000 agents,  between 10 and 2000 categories of services, and with three to six  services required by each age nt.  We show that, for instance, in a  system with 80 service categories and 2000 agents, each requiring  three random services between 93% and 97% of possible matches are  discovered.  Such a system can work with at least 90 different  service categories and tens of thousands of agents.  12 Refs.

Title: Terrain coverage with ant robots: A simulation study
Abstract: In this paper, we study a simple means for coordinating teams of  simple agents.  In particular, we study ant robots and how they can  cover terrain once or repeatedly by leaving markings in the terrain, similar to what ants do.  These markings can be sensed by all robots  and allow them to cover terrain even if they do not communicate with each other except via the markings, do not have any kind of memory,  do not know the terrain, cannot maintain maps of the terrain, nor  plan complete paths.  The robots do not even need to be localized,  which completely eliminates solving difficult and time-consuming  localization problems.  In this paper, we use real-time heuristic  search methods to implement ant robots and present a simulation  study with several real-time heuristic search methods to study their properties for terrain coverage.  Our experiments show that all of  the real-time heuristic search methods robustly cover terrain even  if the robots are moved without realizing this, some robots fail,  and some markings g et destroyed.  These results demonstrate that  terrain coverage with real-time heuristic search methods is an  interesting alternative to more conventional terrain coverage  methods.  37 Refs.

Title: Intelligent agents for an artificial market system
Abstract: This paper describes an agent-based artificial market system whose  underlying interaction protocols provide advanced features.  Using  the system, actors (i.e., customers and merchants) can delegate a  variety of tasks to personal intelligent agents that act as their  artificial employees.  Contrary to other approaches, where a new  agent is launched when their associated actors intend to perform a  buying or selling transaction and "lives" only while this  transaction is processed, our approach builds on a personalization  of agents that permanently "live" in the market representing their  actors.' interests.  Beyond just requesting and proposing an offer,  agents in our system maintain a profile of their owners, which is  updated upon the actor-agent interaction type.  Furthermore, they can proactively ask their owners' permission to initiate a transaction  (e.g., when a new product, which match one's profile, appears in the market).  The system is also enabled with a highly interactive  multiple cr iteria decision making tool that can handle  ill-structured information during a purchase transaction, and  perform a progressive synthesis and comparative evaluation of the  existing proposals.  17 Refs.

Title: How communication can improve the performance of multi-agent systems
Abstract: We analyze a general model of multi-agent communication in which all  agents learn to communicate simultaneously to a message board.  We  show that the communicating multiagent system is equivalent to a  Mealy finite state machine whose states are determined by the  agents' usage of the learned language.  Increasing the language size  increases the number of possible states in the Mealy machine, and  can improve the performance of the multi-agent system.  We introduce  the term semantic density to describe the average number of meanings assigned to each word of a language.  Using semantic density, a  simple rule is presented that provides a pessimistic estimate of the minimum language size that should be used for any multi-agent  problem in which the agents communicate simultaneously.  Simulations  on a version of the predator-prey pursuit problem, a simplified  version of problems seen in warfare scenarios, validate these  predictions.  The communicating predators evolved using a genetic  algorithm perform significantly b etter than all previous work on  similar preys.  16 Refs.

Title: A dynamic mechanism for time-constrained trading
Abstract: The market mechanism design is important for both conventional and  electronic commerce as it affects the fairness and efficiency of  trading.  In this paper, we propose a new market mechanism for  time-constrained trading.  Our mechanism mimics the traditional  brokering system, where buyers and sellers meet together and  negotiate through an electronic marketplace.  At each time step,  agents are paired up for negotiating a deal.  We consider that buyer  and seller agents are associated with a time constraint and a search cost, and thus must decide promptly and judiciously whether to  accept an offer.  One distinguishing feature of our mechanism is that the marketplace provides buyer and seller agents with statistical  information about the goods.  Specifically, the statistics include  the probability distributions of obtaining and losing a particular  offer.  With this information, the agents' decision can be viewed as  a Markov decision process, and the optimal (dominant) trading  strategy can be computed.  In other word s, buyer and seller agents  can make trading decisions that maximize their expected utility  without the need of speculating others' actions.  We also explain how such a dominant strategy can be computed in an efficient manner.   Another distinguishing feature of the proposed mechanism is that the statistics are updated continuously and hence the dominant trading  strategy is adaptive.  Experimental results verify that our mechanism facilitates a fair allocation to the trading agents under various  demand and supply conditions.  19 Refs.

Title: An auction agent for bidding on combinations of items
Abstract: This paper describes a way to obtain sub-optimal profits in bidding  for combinations of goods that are on auction at different sites,  and results for an autonomous agent that bids for goods according to the proposed strategy.  The types of requirements for combinations  are classified as complementary, substitutive and independent.  For  each type, this paper specifies the region in which bidding on goods will make a positive profit.  A bidding strategy is then proposed for sequential auctions under the condition that the bids by the other  participants in the auction can be represented by a probabilistic  function.  Two simulations were constructed to evaluate the proposed  strategy.  They indicated that the agent that applies the proposed  strategy was superior to others that bid for combinations of goods  according to simple and intuitive strategies.  The simulations also  indicated that the proposed strategy was the equilibrium strategy of those we tested, when two agents were simultaneously bidding for the same c ombination of goods.  9 Refs.

Title: Economic dynamics of agents in multiple auctions
Abstract: Over the last few years, electronic auctions have become an  increasingly important aspect of e-commerce, both in the business to business and business to consumer domains.  As a result of this, it  is often possible to find many auctions selling similar goods on the web.  However, when an individual is attempting to purchase such a  good, they will usually bid in one, or a small number, of such  auctions.  This results in two forms of inefficiency.  Firstly, the  individual may pay more for the good than would be expected in an  ideal market.  Secondly, some sellers may fail to make a sale that  could take place in an ideal market.  In this paper, we present an  agent that is able to participate in multiple auctions for a given  good, placing bids appropriately to secure the cheapest price.  We  present experiments to show; (i) Current auction markets on the web  are inefficient, with trades taking place away from equilibrium  price, and not all benefit from trade being extracted.  (ii) Our  agent is able to exploit these i nefficiencies, resulting in it  making higher profits than the simple strategy of bidding in a small number of auctions.  (iii) As more participants use our agent, the  market becomes more efficient.  When all participants use the agent,  all trades take place close to equilibrium price, and the market  approaches ideal behaviour.  24 Refs.

Title: Architectural design of a multi-agent system for handling metadata  streams
Abstract: We have designed a multi-agent architecture to deliver meta-data  streams synchronously with multimedia streams over a wide-area  network.  To this end, we have devised a simple protocol for  synchronising agents to a media clock.  This protocol defines the  concept of a deadline, after which servers can drop data because it  can no longer reach clients in time.  We also introduce a new concept of a contract as a first-class entity representing a successful  subscription; a contract is used by agents as a session identifier  during the navigation of streams.  Quality of service is a vital  element of this architecture because of the need to deliver metadata on time.  As a result, our architecture supports various  communication protocols, including UDP, RMI, SSL, or multicast.  This resulted in a return to a more declarative form of speech acts,  totally orthogonal to a notion of virtual communication channel used to manage the quality of service of communication.  24 Refs.

Title: Denotational semantics four agent communication languages
Abstract: The dilemma encountered in the design of an agent communication  language (ACL) for an open society is that it should be based on  externally observable phenomena yet it should capture something of  the intuitions behind the high level abstractions typically found in internal mental states.  Our solution treats an ACL message as a  declarative statement that is given a procedural interpretation by a denotational semantics.  This defines a speech act as a function  between states.  These states are social states which store public  information including expressed mental attitudes and control  variables.  Expressed mental attitudes are externally observable and  capture the conventional public meaning of communication.  The  variables control the flow of conversation in a protocol.  We  conclude firstly that since the denotational semantics is based on  externally observable phenomena, it is possible to verify compliance and prove properties of protocols.  Secondly, since the semantics is  more expressive than behavioural sp ecifications, it lays the  foundation for high-level communication between intelligent agents.   8 Refs.

Title: Interaction patterns and observable commitments in a multi-agent  trading scenario
Abstract: We propose a formal semantics for the protocol diagrams (interaction  patterns) of AUML (Agent Unified Modelling Language).  We connect  this proposal with a general framework for defining the semantics of ACLs (Agent Communication Languages).  We then show that protocol  diagrams should be parameterised with observable commitments:  additional specification of the expected outcomes and normative  positions resulting from the use of the protocol.  A complete  axiomatisation of a contract-net protocol is given, and animated to  show how the agents comply with expected replies and respecting the  norms.  We conclude that this approach to 'socialising' interaction  between agents is important for developing open agent systems and  potentially useful in standardisation.  11 Refs.

Title: Wasp nests for self-configurable factories
Abstract: Agent-based approaches to manufacturing scheduling and control have  gained increasing attention in recent years.  Such approaches are  attractive because they offer increased robustness against the  unpredictability of factory operations.  But the specification of  local coordination policies that give rise to efficient global  performance and effectively adapt to changing circumstances remains  an interesting challenge.  In this paper, we introduce a new approach to this coordination problem, drawing on various aspects of a  computational model of how wasp colonies coordinate individual  activities and allocate tasks to meet the collective needs of the  nest.  We focus specifically on the problem of configuring machines  in a factory to best satisfy (potentially changing) product demands  over time.  Our system models the set of jobs queued in front of any  given machine as a wasp nest, wherein wasp-like agents interact to  form a social hierarchy and prioritize the jobs that they represent.  Other wasp-like agents exter nal to the nest act as overall machine  proxies, and use a model of wasp task allocation behavior to  determine which new jobs should be accepted into the machine's  queue.  We show for simple factories that our multi-agent system  achieves the desired effect.  For a given job mix, the system  converges to a factory configuration that maximizes overall  performance, and as the job mix changes, the system quickly adapts  to a new, more appropriate configuration.  20 Refs.

Title: Agents teaching agents to share meaning
Abstract: The promise of intelligent agents acting on behalf of users'  personalized knowledge sharing needs may be hampered by the  insistence that these agents begin with a predefined, common  ontology instead of personalized, diverse ontologies.  Only until  recently have researchers diverged from the last decade's "common  ontology" paradigm to a paradigm involving agents that can share  knowledge using diverse ontologies.  This paper describes how we  address this agent knowledge sharing problem of how agents deal with diverse ontologies by introducing a methodology and algorithms for  multi-agent knowledge sharing and learning.  We demonstrate how this  approach will enable multi-agent systems to assist groups of people  in locating, translating, and sharing knowledge using our  Distributed Ontology Gathering Group Integration Environment  (DOGGIE) and describe our proof-of-concept experiments.  DOGGIE  synthesizes agent communication, machine learning, and reasoning for information sharing in the Web domain.  24 Refs.

Title: A multi-agent system for automated genomic annotation
Abstract: Massive amounts of raw data are currently being generated by  biologists while sequencing organisms.  Outside of the largest,  high-profile projects such as the Human Genome Project, most of this raw data must be analyzed through the piecemeal application of  various computer programs and searches of various public web  databases.  Due to the inexperience and lack of training, both the  raw data and any valuable derived knowledge will remain generally  unavailable except in published textual forms.  Multi-agent  information gathering systems have a lot to contribute to these  efforts, even at the current state of the art.  We have used DECAF, a multi-agent system toolkit based on RETSINA and TAEMS, to construct  a prototype multi-agent system for automated annotation and database storage of sequencing data for herpesviruses.  The resulting system  eliminates tedious and always out-of-date hand analyses, makes the  data and annotations available for other researchers (or agent  systems), and provides a level of query proc essing beyond even some high-profile web sites.  28 Refs.

Title: Cooperative multi-agent intelligent field terminals
Abstract: We have developed a method for improving cooperation in complex  systems that uses multi-agent (MA) intelligent field terminals  (IFTs).  The MA function evaluates the control conditions of the  overall system and the conditions of the other IFTs.  To shorten the  turn-around time for data transfer among IFTs, the conflicts that  occur when the data processed by different IFTs is inconsistent or  irregular must be resolved autonomously.  We thus incorporate a  predictive agent in each IFT, and these agents cooperate to resolve  the conflicts.  Experimental results showed that this method not only provides adequate controls but also reduces the load on the network  and the turn-around time when the number of IFTs is less than 30.  9  Refs.

Title: Argumentation as distributed constraint satisfactions: Applications  and results
Abstract: Conflict resolution is a critical problem in distributed and  collaborative multi-agent systems.  Negotiation via argumentation  (NVA), where agents provide explicit arguments or justifications for their proposals for resolving conflicts, is an effective approach to resolve conflicts.  Indeed, we are applying argumentation in some  real-world multi-agent applications.  However, a key problem in such  applications is that a well-understood computational model of  argumentation is currently missing, making it difficult to  investigate convergence and scalability of argumentation techniques, and to understand and characterize different collaborative NVA  strategies in a principled manner.  To alleviate these difficulties,  we present distributed constraint satisfaction problem (DCSP) as a  computational model for investigating NVA.  We model argumentation as constraint propagation in DCSP.  This model enables us to study  convergence properties of argumentation, and formulate and  experimentally compare 16 different NVA str ategies with different  levels of agent cooperativeness towards others.  One surprising  result from our experiments is that maximizing cooperativeness is  not necessarily the best strategy even in a completely cooperative  environment.  The paper illustrates the usefulness of these results  in applying NVA to multi-agent systems, as well as to DCSP systems  in general.  15 Refs.

Title: Using background knowledge to speed reinforcement learning in  physical agents
Abstract: This paper describes Icarus, an agent architecture that embeds a  hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm within a language for  specifying agent behavior.  An Icarus program expresses an  approximately correct theory about how to behave with options at  varying levels of detail, while the Icarus agent determines the best options by learning from experience.  We describe Icarus and its  learning algorithm, then report on two experiments in a vehicle  control domain.  The first examines the benefit of new distinctions  about state, whereas the second explores the impact of added plan  structure.  We show that background knowledge increases learning rate and asymptotic performance, and decreases plan size by three orders  of magnitude, relative to the typical formulation of the learning  problem in our test domain.  23 Refs.

Title: Hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the use of hierarchical reinforcement  learning to speed up the acquisition of cooperative multi-agent  tasks.  We extend the MAXQ framework to the multi-agent case.  Each  agent uses the same MAXQ hierarchy to decompose a task into  sub-tasks.  Learning is decentralized, with each agent learning three interrelated skills: how to perform subtasks, which order to do them in, and how to coordinate with other agents.  Coordination skills  among agents are learned by using joint actions at the highest  level(s) of the hierarchy.  The Q nodes at the highest level(s) of  the hierarchy are configured to represent the joint task-action  space among multiple agents.  In this approach, each agent only knows what other agents are doing at the level of sub-tasks, and is  unaware of lower level (primitive) actions.  This hierarchical  approach allows agents to learn coordination faster by sharing  information at the level of sub-tasks, rather than attempting to  learn coordination taking into account primit ive joint state-action values.  We apply this hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement  learning algorithm to a complex AGV scheduling task and compare its  performance and speed with other learning approaches, including flat multi-agent, single agent using MAXQ, selfish multiple agents using  MAXQ (where each agent acts independently without communicating with the other agents), as well as several well-known AGV heuristics like "first come first serve", "highest queue first" and "nearest station first".  We also compare the tradeoffs in learning speed vs.   performance of modeling joint action values at multiple levels in  the MAXQ hierarchy.  19 Refs.

Title: Dealing with interoperability for agent-based services
Abstract: Interoperability problems occur when developing agent systems with a  strong notion of autonomy while interacting with other agents.  The  agent platform has become the intelligent distributed operating  system for agent applications and therefore the support of much of  the interoperability between agents will be through the platforms  themselves.  With the possibility of inter-platform interoperability  comes support for open services that goes beyond current open agent  architectures.  This paper looks at the design issues of  interoperability that need to be addressed on both the communication and application levels.  It identifies solutions to some of these  issues and defines a set of components, which are implemented and  tested as a toolkit, in order to support Open Agent Service  Architecture development and deployment.  4 Refs.

Title: Modelling and visualizing agent conversations
Abstract: Although the notion of conversations has been discussed for some time as a way in which to provide an abstract representation of extended  agent message exchange, there is still no consensus established  concerning how to use these abstractions effectively.  This paper  describes a layered approach based on coloured Petri Nets that can  be used for modelling complex, concurrent conversations among agents in a multi-agent system.  The approach can be used both to define  simple conversation protocols and to define more complex  conversation protocols composed of a number of simpler  conversations.  With this method it is possible (a) to capture the  concurrent characteristics of a conversation, (b) to capture the  state of a conversation at runtime, and (c) to reuse conversation  structures for the processing of multiple concurrent messages.  5  Refs.

Title: Configuration management for multi-agent systems
Abstract: As heterogeneous distributed systems, multi-agent systems present  some challenging configuration management issues.  There are the  problems of knowing how to allocate agents to computers, launch them on remote hosts, and once the agents have been launched, how to  monitor their runtime status so as to manage computing resources  effectively.  In this paper, we present the RETSINA Configuration  Manager, RECoMa.  We describe its architecture, how it uses agent  infrastructure such as service discovery, to assist the multi-agent  system administrator in allocating, launching, and monitoring a  heterogeneous distributed agent system in a distributed and  networked computing environment.  3 Refs.

Title: An agent-based approach to imagery and geospatial computing
Abstract: This paper introduces a scalable, flexible agent-based architecture  for imagery and geospatial processing.  This architecture supports  collaboration and reuse by defining a set of fine-grained imagery  and geospatial processing agents and a combined knowledge encoding  and Agent Communication Language called I-XML.  Scalability and reuse are achieved by employing a collaborative communication structure.   Agents do not communicate directly; rather, all collaboration and  reuse goes through a shared page space that stores I-XML pages.  We  show how this approach simplifies system design and facilitates  collaboration and information sharing among area experts.  This  architecture has been implemented in the Java environment using Jini middleware for agent communication and mobility, and COTS packages  for processing functionality.  3 Refs.

Title: CMPack: A complete software system for autonomous legged soccer  robots
Abstract: This paper describes a completely implemented, fully autonomous  software system for soccer playing quadruped robots.  The system  includes real-time color vision, probabilistic localization,  quadruped locomotion/motion, and a hierarchical behavior system.   Each component was based on well tested algorithms and approaches  from other domains.  Our design exposed strengths and weaknesses in  each component, and led to improvements and extensions that made  them more capable in general, as well as better suited for our  testing domain.  Integrating the components revealed design  assumptions that were violated.  We describe the problems that arose  and how we addressed them.  The integrated system was then used at  the annual Robo-Cup robotic soccer competition where we placed  third, losing only a single game.  We reflect on how our system  addressed its goals and what was learned through implementation and  testing on real robots.  11 Refs.

Title: A Reflexive, not impulsive agent
Abstract: The aim of our present research is to build an Agent capable of  communicative and expressive behavior.  The Agent should be able to  express its emotions but also to refrain from expressing them: A  reflexive, not an impulsive Agent.  A Reflexive Agent is an agent who thinks it over before displaying one's emotions, that is, one who,  when feeling an emotion, "decides" not to display it immediately.  In this paper we present our enriched discourse generator and we give a general overview of the factors that we consider to determine the  displaying or not displaying of an emotion.  4 Refs.

Title: Negotiation protocols and dialogue games
Abstract: The building blocks for flexible negotiations, based on dialogue  games, were presented.  Basic initiative response pairs, specific to  a particular type of dialogue, were defined by initiative handling,  grounding, update rules and coherence relations together.  Larger  dialogues could be constructed coherently from such basic exchanges.  The notion of uptake was crucial for the applications that do not  required a pre-negotiation phase.  A responder could 'take up' and  respond to an initiative in one of the many possible ways.  This  jointly determined the out-come of the interaction.  (Edited  abstract) 11 Refs.

Title: The intelligent classroom: Providing competent assistance
Abstract: In the software industry, designers are forever trying to "improve"  their products by adding ever more features to them, producing  bloated software systems that are capable of doing just about  anything.  However, these systems often make it increasingly  difficult for their users to perform their tasks as they are forced  to wade through a mess of unwanted features to find the few that  they actually need.  We believe that a fruitful area of research is  in building intelligent systems for particular tasks and then having the systems actively try to assist their users in performing these  tasks.  Such a system knows the plans (and the problems associated  with those plans) that their users are likely to pursue.  These  competent assistants can use their expertise on their particular  tasks to guide their users through their tasks, provide better help, or perhaps even volunteer to take over some part of the task.  Such  an assistive agent is able to helpful because, through its task  knowledge, it is able to l imit what it needs to consider in  cooperating with its user.  In this paper we look at the  implementation of a competent assistant that functions in a physical domain.  The Intelligent Classroom is a prototype automated lecture  facility that serves as its own audio/visual assistant.  We focus on  the representations and algorithms to use task knowledge to produce  cooperative behavior, arguing these techniques could easily to be  extended for use in a wide range of domains (i.e. both physical and  purely electronic domains).  14 Refs.

Title: Coaching a simulated soccer team by opponent model recognition
Abstract: In multiagent domains with adversarial and cooperative agents, team  agents should be adaptive to the current environment and opponent.   We introduce an online method to provide the agents with team plans  that a "coach" agent generates in response to the specific  opponents.  The coach agent is equipped with a number of pre-defined  opponent models.  The coach is then able to quickly select between  different models online by using a naive Bayes style algorithm,  making the planning adaptive to the current adversary.  The coach  uses a Simple Temporal Network to represent team plans as  coordinated movements among the multiple agents and it searches for  an opponent-dependent plan for its teammates.  This plan is then  communicated to the agents, who execute the plan in a distributed  fashion.  The system is fully implemented in a simulated robotic  soccer domain.  8 Refs.

Title: Entropy and self-organization in multi-agent systems
Abstract: Emergent self-organization in multi-agent systems appears to  contradict the second law of thermodynamics.  This paradox has been  explained in terms of a coupling between the macro level that hosts  self-organization (and an apparent reduction in entropy), and the  micro level (where random processes greatly increase entropy).   Metaphorically, the micro level serves as an entropy "sink,"  permitting overall system entropy to increase while sequestering  this increase from the interactions where self-organization is  desired.  We make this metaphor precise by constructing a simple  example of pheromone-based coordination, defining a way to measure  the Shannon entropy at the macro (agent) and micro (pheromone)  levels, and exhibiting an entropy-based view of the coordination.  15 Refs.

Title: Trust-based facilitator for e-partnerships
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a facilitator that finds capable and  trustworthy partners on behalf of client users, which helps users  form and maintain e-partnerships for electronic commerce and  electronic collaboration.  Unlike existing capability-based  facilitators or matchmakers, the facilitator collects and maintains  private "word-of-mouth" trust information as well as capabilities  from each user and uses the information for personalized trust-based facilitation for each user, which is done through the facilitation  protocols and trust propagation mechanism.  Compared to other  existing trust mechanisms, the characteristics of trust, which this  facilitator handles, are  personalized-collaborative-subjective-qualitative-private.  7 Refs.

Title: Using agents to build a practical implementation of the INCA  (intelligent community alarm) system
Abstract: This paper describes an agent system to demonstrate the practicality  of the INCA (Intelligent Community Support for the Elderly)  architecture.  This architecture is intended to integrate a number of autonomous systems; home monitoring, community alarms, care  management systems and emergency systems command and control systems using agent technology to build effective coordinated care systems.   A range of different autonomous bodies provides such care, many of  which have their own management information systems already in  place.  Since these systems do not only contain information relevant  to community care, but also all the other activities of the agent,  that it would be unwilling to make available to other parties, the  actual management of community care has remained primarily outside  the role of current systems.  The current demonstrator has been built using the ZEUS agent-building toolkit (Nwana et al (1999)) as the  basis for the development of a 'bench-top' demonstrator to show that the INCA architecture is both scalable to realistic activity levels  and integrates fully and effectively with existing computer systems  in the various agencies involved, without loss of autonomy and  security.  5 Refs.

Title: Representing social structures in UML
Abstract: From a software engineering perspective, agent systems are a  specialization of object-oriented (OO) systems, in which individual  objects have their own threads of control and their own goals.   Engineering such systems is most naturally approached as an  extension of object-oriented systems engineering.  In particular, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) can be naturally extended to Agent  UML (AUML) [5] to support the distinctive  requirements of multi-agent systems.  One such requirement results  from the correspondence between multi-agent systems and social  systems.  We combine several existing organizational models for  agents, including AALAADIN, dependency theory, interaction  protocols, and holonics, in a general theoretical framework, and  show how UML can capture constructions in that framework left  bracket 9] .  9 Refs.

Title: Sensible Agents: An implemented multi-agent system and testbed
Abstract: Sensible Agents have been engineered to solve distributed problems in complex, uncertain, and dynamic domains.  Each Sensible Agent is  composed of four modules: the Action Planner, Perspective Modeler,  Conflict Resolution Advisor, and Autonomy Reasoner.  These modules  give Sensible Agents the abilities to plan, model, resolve  individual conflicts, and change agent system organization.  Two  component suites provide a variety of user-oriented features: the  Sensible Agent Run-time Environment (SARTE) and the Sensible Agent  Testbed.  The SARTE provides facilities for instantiating Sensible  Agents, deploying a Sensible Agent system, and monitoring run-time  operations.  The Sensible Agents Testbed facilitates automated  generation of parameter combinations for controlled experiments,  deterministic and non-deterministic simulation, and configuration of Sensible Agents and data acquisition.  Experimentation is a crucial  step in gaining insight into the behavior of agents, as well as  evidence toward or against hypothese s. Using a real-world example,  this paper explains and demonstrates: (1) the functional  capabilities of Sensible Agents, (2) the Sensible Agent Run-Time  Environment's facilities for monitoring and control of Sensible  Agent systems and (3) the experimental set-up, monitoring, and  analysis capabilities of the Sensible Agent Testbed.  21 Refs.

Title: Multi-agent visualisation based on multivariate data
Abstract: Interesting features of complex agent systems can be captured as  multivariate data.  There are a number of different approaches to  visualizing such data.  In this paper, we focus on methods which  reduce the dimensions of the data through matrix transformations and then visualise the entities in the lower-dimensional space.  We  review an approach which describes agent similarities through  distances, which are then visualised by multi-dimensional scaling  techniques.  We point out some shortcomings of this approach and  examine an alternative, which applies principal component analysis  and subsequent visualisation directly to the data.  Our approach is  implemented in the Space Explorer tool, which also allows  interactive exploration.  We identify four categories of data, which  capture interaction, profiles, time series, and combinations of  these three.  Then we consider how to employ them for various agent  types such as communicating, mobile, personal, interface,  information and collaborating agents.  Finally, we ex amine  real-world telecoms data of 90,000 calls with Space Explorer.  21  Refs.

Title: Determining bidding strategies in sequential auctions: Quasi-linear  utility and budget constraints
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a new method for finding an optimal bidding strategy in sequential auctions, using a dynamic programming  technique.  The existing method assumes the utility of a user is  represented in an additive form.  Thus, the remaining endowment of  money must be explicitly represented in each state.  On the other  hand, our method assumes the utility of a user can be represented in a quasi-linear form, and representing the payment as a  state-transition cost.  Accordingly, we can obtain more than an  m-fold speed-up in the computation time, where m is the initial  endowment of money.  Furthermore, we have developed a method for  obtaining a semi-optimal bidding strategy under budget constraints.   2 Refs.

Title: Design of a trust model for a secure multi-agent marketplace
Abstract: A general trust model and security framework for a multi-agent system designed to manage resources in future mobile communications  networks is described.  The multi-agent system is being developed as  part of the IST SHUFFLE project [1] .  A  business model appropriate for selling of bandwidth resource and  services is investigated and mechanisms to achieve a Global Trust  Model is outlined.  Our trust model for the marketplace is based on  concentric spheres structure.  The core of this model will be  physical security.  A security infrastructure is located in middle  spheres: the internal and the external security infrastructure.  In  outer spheres we will use complex aspects of trust such as fairness, reliability, reputation and loyalty to provide a complete model of  basic trust for marketplaces.  4 Refs.

The task delegation and social delegation are the  two types of operations which needs differentiations.  The four  different mechanisms are observed to determine a delegate to  accumulate social capital that pay-off in the future.  (Edited  abstract) 11 Refs.

Title: Vicious strategies for Vickrey auctions
Abstract: We show that the Vickrey auction, despite its theoretical benefits,  is inappropriate if "antisocial" agents participate in the auction  process.  More specifically, an antisocial attitude for economic  agents that makes reducing the profit of competitors their main goal besides maximizing their own profit is introduced.  Under this novel  condition, agents need to deviate from the dominant truth-telling  strategy.  This paper presents a strategy for bidders in repeated  Vickrey auctions who are intending to inflict losses to fellow  agents in order to be more successful, not in absolute measures, but relatively to the group of bidders.  3 Refs.

Title: Simultaneous optimization of multiple criteria for efficient agent  service brokering
Abstract: Efficient, flexible and dynamic allocation of combination of services to satisfy advanced service requirements in multi-agent systems is a crucial problem.  Optimal service allocation based on a single  criterion is NP-Complete.  However, service requirements in general  have multiple criteria that may be conflicting and  non-commensurable.  This paper presents a genetic algorithm for  optimal anytime service allocation based on multiple criteria.  The  solution found by the genetic algorithm is optimal in terms of the  information (criterion weighting and minimize/maximize criterion)  provided by the client.  We present our algorithm and show how the  performance of the algorithm varies as the number of criteria  varies.  The results show the performance of the algorithm is  sub-linear as the number of criteria increases.  The algorithm has  the ability to deal with any number of criteria.  By addressing this  problem, we expand the range of problems being addressed to any that require simultaneous optimization of multiple criteria.  1 Refs.

Title: Matchmaking for autonomous agents in electronic marketplaces
Abstract: Matchmaking is the process of mediating demand and supply based on  profile information.  Matchmaking plays a crucial role in agent-based electronic marketplaces: the problem to be solved is to find the  most appropriate agents, products, or services for a task,  negotiation, or market transaction.  Most real-world problems require multidimensional matchmaking, i.e., the ability to combine various  dimensions of decision-making to define an overall solution to a  matchmaking problem, requiring the interplay of multiple matchmaking algorithms.  In addition, in order to be applicable for real-world  applications, the matchmaking component must be easily integrated  into standard industrial marketplace platforms.  The work described  in this work aims at deploying agent-based matchmaking for  industrial electronic business applications.  The main contributions  of this work are the following: (i) we provide a configurable  framework called GRAPPA (Generic Request Architecture for Passive  Provider Agents) which is designed to be adapted to electronic  marketplace applications.  Using GRAPPA, system designers can easily  specify demand and supply profiles as XML objects; (ii) within  GRAPPA we provide an extensible library of matchmaking functions  (building blocks) that can be used for rapid development of  matchmaking solutions that include standard information retrieval  algorithms.  10 Refs.

Title: Collaborative multiagent learning for classification tasks
Abstract: Multiagent learning differs from standard machine learning in that  most existing learning methods assume that all knowledge is  available locally in a single agent.  In multiagent systems, this  assumption does not hold because relevant knowledge is distributed  among the agents within the system.  We describe a decentralized  learning algorithm for distributed classification tasks, i.e.   classification when the attributes are distributed among a set of  agents and cannot be gathered into a central agent.  Our main  contribution is to introduce and formalize the distributed  classification task, show that existing classification algorithms  are not satisfactory for distributed classification tasks, and  finally, to show that our collaborative learning algorithm performs  well at distributed classification.  2 Refs.

Title: Evolving real-time local agent control for large-scale MAS
Abstract: Control for agents situated in multi-agent systems is a complex  problem.  This is particularly true in hard, open, dynamic  environments where resource, privacy, bandwidth, and computational  limitations impose restrictions on the type of information that  agents may share and the control problem solving options available  to agents.  The MQ or motivational quantities framework addresses  these issues by evaluating candidate tasks based on the agent's  organizational context and by framing control as a local agent  optimization problem that approximates the global problem through  the use of state and preference.  23 Refs.

Title: An agent based approach to distributed task modeling for co-operative task support
Abstract: This paper describes the design and implementation of an agent based  network for the support of collaborative switching tasks within the  control room environment of the National Grid Company plc.  This work has included aspects from several research disciplines, including  operational analysis, human computer interaction, finite state  modelling techniques, intelligent agents and computer supported  co-operative work.  Aspects of these procedures have been used in the analysis of collaborative tasks to produce distributed local models  for all involved users.  These models have been used as the basis for the production of local finite state automata.  These automata have  then been embedded within an agent network together with behavioural information extracted from the task and user analysis phase.  The  resulting support system is capable of task and communication  management within the transmission despatch environment.  In tests  carried out with groups of untrained users, the support system  described here resulted in average time saving of between 41-47%  over the whole of the test scenario.  11 Refs.

Title: Formation behavior for large-scale micro-robot force deployment
Abstract: Micro-robots will soon be available for deployment by the thousands.   Consequently, controlling and coordinating a force this large to  accomplish a prescribed task is of great interest.  This paper  describes a flexible architecture for modeling thousands of  autonomous agents simultaneously.  The agents' behavior is based on a subsumption architecture in which individual behaviors are  prioritized with respect to all others.  The primary behavior  explored in this work is a group formation behavior based on social  potential fields.  This paper extends the social potential field  model by introducing a neutral zone within which other behaviors may exhibit themselves.  Previous work with social potential fields has  been restricted to models of  perfect' autonomous agents.  The paper  evaluates the effect of social potential fields in the presence of  agent death (failure) and imperfect sensory input.  (Author abstract) 11 Refs.

Title: Knowledge base for knowledge-based multiagent system construction
Abstract: The goal of the agentTool project at the Air Force Institute of  Technology is to specify, design, and semi-automatically generate  multiagent systems.  The key to this ability is an underlying  knowledge base that manages the knowledge used by the system  designer in creating intelligent agent-based software applications.   This paper describes the Agent knowledge Interchange Mechanism  (AIM), the agentTool knowledge base.  There are four main components  to AIM: the knowledge parser, the Multiagent Markup Language, the  AIM domain model, and the Agent-oriented Random-Access  Meta-Structure (ARAMS).  AIM is implemented using a multiagent system architecture that permits multiple developers to share a single  knowledge base thus directly supporting collaborative system design  and knowledge reuse.

Title: Kernel-oriented algorithm for transmission expansion planning
Abstract: With deregulation sweeping all over electrical systems around the  world, transmission planning has undergone dramatic changes during  this decade.  Centralized cost allocation methods have become  obsolete and new procedures are needed to deal with intelligent and  self-sufficient players.  In this paper we study the allocation of  transmission costs in a decentralized manner.  For this purpose we  have developed a multi-agent system that is based on a well known  cooperative game theory procedure, the kernel.  Using our approach,  the agents are able to form kernel-stable coalitions and the cost  allocation procedure is performed at every step of the kernel-  algorithm.  A six bus example and an IEEE 24 bus case illustrate our  model.  (Author abstract) 21 Refs.

Title: Man-machine collaborative work based on visual communication
Abstract: A new concept of a multi-agent system is proposed in this paper in  which, not only the entities equipped with actuators, but also  static objects take the role of agents by recognizing their own  situations and broadcasting their requests.  It is expected that in  future a computer will be manufactured in the form of a smaller and  thinner entity like a bar code film with some sensors.  This style of computer will be attached to every industrial product, which may  result in such static agents as proposed in the present paper.  A  case study is described which shows a man-machine visual  communication system for those who need help to take things such as  aged or handicapped people.  Roles of static object agents in the  system are shown and their significance is discussed as well as the  performance of the entire system.  (Author abstract) 5 Refs.

Title: Multi-agent enabled modeling and simulation towards collaborative  inventory management in supply chains
Abstract: This paper is framed to address the preliminary approach towards  process-oriented collaborative inventory management in supply  chains, taking advantage of multi-agent technology in terms of  modeling and simulation.  Initially, a SCM support model is proposed  as a foundation to combine the supply chain processes with the  multi-agent system.  In succession, a simple PC assembling case is  investigated and simulated mainly to validate the SCM support model.  As a result, the combination has the potential to make possible a  real strategic competitive advantage for the entire supply chain and will enable new forms of business, namely, collaborative inventory  management.  Accordingly, a theoretical framework of collaborative  inventory management is highlighted to refine and extend the SCM  support model with the purpose to synchronize decisions as well as  actions.

Abstract: This paper discusses the use of simulation in a new context.  Most  often QUEST is viewed as a stand-alone simulation tool to analyze  and understand shop floor behavior.

This paper attempts to  demonstrate how QUEST is being used in conjunction with an agent  based scheduling software (henceforth referred to as Scheduler)  developed using Java.  The Scheduler is a multi-threaded application  using software agents.  It can run in a distributed manner over a  LAN.  This paper deals with the agent based architecture of the  Scheduler as well as the important role of simulation in validating  the Scheduler.  (Author abstract) 3 Refs.

Title: Implementing a multi-agent systems approach to collaborative  autonomous manufacturing operations
Abstract: Remote space operations is a very demanding domain for software  systems, requiting the characteristics of high availability,  robustness, autonomy, real-time or near real-time response times,  ease of reprogramming, and low computational footprint.  A further  desirable characteristic is the ability for remote systems or  vehicles to collaborate to achieve tasks such as exploration or  remote processing or sensing.  Intelligent agent technology has  advanced to the point where it is now finding application in robotic manufacturing, such as the application described in this paper.  The  authors believe that many of the lessons being learned in the  collaborative manufacturing domain have relevance to space  operations.  This paper describes a novel agent-based execution  architecture.  Integral to this architecture is the separation of  part processing concerns from manufacturing concerns.  Thus we have  part agents which are able to issue and track resource-independent  part-processing requests.  An interface agent then tra nsforms a  resource-independent request into one or more resource-dependent  requests and dispatches them to the appropriate manufacturing  agents.  Execution of the dispatched requests then proceeds  autonomously, taking into account safety constraints.  We also  describe an implementation of this architecture for a robotic  assembly cell located at the University of Cambridge using JACK  Intelligent Agents trademark .  The paper concludes with the lessons  learned from this experiment, and highlights those of relevance to  the domain of space operations.  11 Refs.

Title: Multi-agent system for formation flying missions
Abstract: Currently, spacecraft are not operated as autonomous coordinated  teams.  Generalized reasoning capability offered by advanced  distributed software technology and AI have the potential to cope  with unexpected events and uncertainty and allow to close the loop  of perception, decision and eventually deliberation, on board.  The  team members play different interchangeable roles and they negotiate the task that they are achieving together.  We present a multi-agent  system to provide a high degree of autonomy and support for  coordination among team members.  We use JPL formation flying mission initial architectures as benchmark.  Our target is to avoid  inconsistencies/disagreements between two or more participants in a  collaborative context, increase the system's fault tolerance in  cases such as loss of a member while the system should be able to  still reliably operate.  We address the cooperation between  independent autonomous agents when they have to collaborate to  achieve a common goal.  In a top-down organization , agents are  coordinated in a hierarchical fashion, where the agents at the top  of the hierarchy make the majority of the intelligent group  decisions.  In a more structured, but still hierarchical  organization, lower-level agents exercise more intelligence in  making group decisions.  A lower-level agent can advance a plan for  the others to follow, and then a higher rank agent will decide on  the best plans produced by individual agents.  Although more rigid,  the centralized intelligence organization allows for less  communication among agents, so is more straightforward to implement.  The decentralized approach requires more communication, but the  intelligence is truly distributed, which makes for a more flexible,  adaptive and efficient organization.  11 Refs.

Title: Feasible formations of multi-agent systems
Abstract: Formations of multi-agent systems, such as satellites and aircraft,  require that individual agents satisfy their kinematic equations  while constantly maintaining inter-agent constraints.  In this paper, we develop a systematic framework for studying formations of  multi-agent systems.  In particular, we consider undirected  formations for centralized formations and directed formations for  decentralized formations.  In each case, we determine differential  geometric conditions that guarantee formation feasibility given the  individual agent kinematics.  Our framework also enables us to  extract a smaller control system that describes the formation  kinematics while maintaining all formation constraints.  9 Refs.

Title: Mobile transactional agents
Abstract: Mobile agents is an important enabling technology for certain types  of real world applications such as e-commerce and workflows.  While  the potential benefits are appealing, this technology is not being  used by many applications. This is largely attributed to the lack of components such as transactions and their integration with de-facto  technologies.  This work focuses on bridging this gap and devising an extended transactional model for mobile agents.  The nature of mobile agents for autonomous processing and mobility introduces numerous  challenges with respect to transactions which are originally  addressed in our work.  First, given flat, unstructured, execution  scripts for agents, it is necessary to isolate side-effects that  occur between two successive migrations to later, be able to commit  or abort them locally according to transaction semantics maintained  across multiple hosts.  Second, intra-transaction parallelism  requires synchronization among multiple autonomous agents to join  their processing and to rollback a transaction. Third, recovery from failures at a specific host, may necessitate maintaining a global  state of a transaction across all the agent's destinations to  determine how to proceed (e.g., repeat activities upon recovery).   This paper presents a comprehensive transaction model for mobile  agents and its deployment in the context of Java-based mobile  agents.  The overall complexity of transaction management is handled  using a division of labor between an object-oriented programming  model, protocols and a concurrency control mechanism.  Specifically,  the programming model maintains separation of concerns between  mobility, transactions and application logic in order to cope with  the aforementioned challenges.

Title: Description and validation of The Media Gateway Control Protocol  (MGCP) using SDL/MSC
Abstract: The Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) is a protocol for  controlling Voice over IP (VoIP) gateways.  The control is exercised  from external call control elements called Media Gateway Controllers (MGCs) or Call Agents (CAs).  The operation of call agents and media  gateways, and their interactions via the MGCP, have been modelled  using SDL.  The checking of general properties of the model were  performed using the ObjectGEODE tool.  A specific scenario, specified using MSCs, was used as a case study to validate our design against  some of the specific properties of the MGCP protocol.  The use of  SDL/MSC simplifies the description and validation of the protocol,  and facilitates the possibility for future extensions of our model.   5 Refs.

Title: Multi-actor-based land use modelling: Spatial planning using agents
Abstract: This paper describes a spatial planning model combining a multi-agent simulation (MAS) approach with cellular automata (CA).  The model  includes individual actor behaviour according to a bottom-up  modelling concept.  Spatial planning intentions and related decision  making of planning actors is defined by agents.  CA is used to infer  the knowledge needed by the agents to make decisions about the  future of a spatial organisation in a certain area.  The innovative  item of this approach offers a framework for modelling complex land  use planning process by extending CA approach with MAS.  The  modelling approach is demonstrated by the implementation of a pilot  model using JAVA and the SWARM agent modelling toolkit.  The pilot  model itself is applied to a study area near the city of Nijmegen,  The Netherlands. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights  reserved.  26 Refs.

Title: An agent-based service brokering architecture for multiservice  next-generation networks
Abstract: This paper describes how advanced distributed software techniques  based on agent technology can be used to provide brokering within a  complex service delivery environment in order to deliver services to end users in a consistent and simple manner.  It also describes the  benefits of separating and distributing service control from service transport in next-generation networks (NGN), a principle inspired by the MSF architecture.  An agent-based multiservice platform, called  Agent Enhanced Service Portal (AESP), has been designed and a  prototype implemented to control broadband service sessions in  Fujitsu's NGN testbed.  The prototype has been implemented using a  web computing platform enhanced with agent technology called  Phoenix.  It consists of five service providers offering high speed  Internet access, Voice over IP (VoIP), Video on Demand (VoD),  streamed video and games services delivered over a broadband core  and access network.  A description of this novel platform and its  related technologies is presente d in this paper, highlighting the  suitability of agent technology to provide brokering facilities and  distributed control in NGN.  5 Refs.

Title: Formation control based on artificial intelligence for multi-agent  coordination
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method of cooperative control based on  artificial intelligent system in distributed autonomous robotic  system.  In general, multi-agent behavior algorithm is simple and  effective for small number of robots.  However the number of robot  goes on increasing, this becomes difficult to be realized because a  multi-robot behavior algorithm requires multiple constraints and  goals in mobile robot navigation problems.  As the solution of above  problem, we propose an architecture of fuzzy system for each robot  speed control and fuzzy-neuro system for obstacle avoidance.   Controller adopts a simple reactive navigation strategy by combining repulsion from obstacles with attraction to a goal.  Simulation  results shows that the proposed strategy is effective for  multi-robot to avoid obstacles while maintaining a formation.  8  Refs.

Title: Design and realization of the planning and coordination system in  agile supply chain management
Abstract: To satisfy customers' personalized requirements with highest quality  as the lowest cost in an agile supply chain management system, it is necessary to make optimal working plans based on orders promptly and guarantee the plans' feasibility, constrained by multiple resource  limitations from multiple independent and autonomous entities.   Planning and coordination are the key components of agile supply  chain management and multi-agent system is an effective technology  to realize the planning and coordination system in agile supply  chain management.  In this paper, a planning and coordination scheme  of two levels is proposed, then the design and realization of the  planning and coordination system based on multi-agent is introduced.  It is proved in practice that this solution will greatly enhance  enterprises' agility and increase their competence in an environment full of competition, cooperation and dynamics.  6 Refs.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a decentralized motion control algorithm of multiple mobile robots transporting a single object in cooperation  with a human based on a path generated from an environment.  Each  mobile robot is controlled as if it has a wheel with a free  rotational joint and moves along the path based on the intentional  force applied by a human.  The proposed decentralized control  algorithm is experimentally applied to the omni-directional mobile  robots referred to as DR Helpers.

Title: Scalable dynamical systems for multi-agent steering and simulation
Abstract: We present a new methodology for agent modeling that is scalable and  efficient.  It is based on the integration of nonlinear dynamical  systems and kinetic data structures.  The method consists of  three-layers that model steering, flocking, and crowding agent  behaviors among moving and static obstacles in 2 and 3D.  The first  layer, the local layer is based on the the use of nonlinear  dynamical systems theory and models low level behaviors, it is fast  and efficient, and does not depend on the total number of agents in  the environment.  The use of dynamical systems allows the use of  continuous numerical parameters with which we can modify the  interaction of each agent with the environment.  This creates  controllable distinctive behaviors.  The second layer, a global  environment layer consists of a specifically designed kinetic data  structure to track efficiently the immediate environment of each  agent and know which obstacles/agents are near or visible to the  given agent.  This layer reduces the complexity in the local layer.   In the third layer, a global planning layer, the problem of target  tracking is generalized in a way that allows navigation in maze-like terrains, avoidance of local minima and cooperation between agents.   We implement this layer based on two approaches that are suitable  for different applications.  One is to track the closest single  moving or static target.  The second is to use a pre-specified vector field.  This vector can be generated automatically (with harmonic  functions, for example) or based on user input to achieve that  desired output.  We demonstrate the power of the approach through a  series of experiments simulating single/multiple agents and crowds  moving towards moving/static targets in complex environments.  36  Refs.

Title: Obstacle avoidance learning for a multi-agent linked robot in the  real world
Abstract: In order to achieve an autonomous system which can adaptively behave  through learning in the real world, we constructed a distributed  autonomous swimming robot that consisted of mechanically linked  multi-agent and adopted adaptive oscillator method that was  developed as a general decision making for distributed autonomous  systems (DASs).  One of the our aims by using this system is to  verify whether the robot could complete a target approaching  including obstacle avoidance.  For this purpose, we introduced a  modified Q-learning in which plural Q-tables are used alternately  according to dead-lock situations.  By using this system, as a  result, the robot acquired stable target approaching and obstacle  avoiding behavior.  11 Refs.

Title: Distributed sensor fusion for object position estimation by  multi-robot systems
Abstract: We present a method for representing, communicating and fusing  distributed, noisy and uncertain observations of an object by  multiple robots.  The approach relies on re-parameterization of the  canonical two-dimensional Gaussian distribution that corresponds  more naturally to the observation space of a robot.  The approach  enables two or more observers to achieve greater effective sensor  coverage of the environment and improved accuracy in object position estimation.  We demonstrate empirically that, when using our  approach, more observers achieve more accurate estimations of an  object's position.  The method is tested in three application areas,  including object location, object tracking, and ball position  estimation for robotic soccer.  Quantitative evaluations of the  technique in use on mobile robots are provided.  23 Refs.

Title: Research of cooperative model based on plan in MAS
Abstract: In the MAS, a single Agent will consider that the other agents's  actions are executed to accomplish it's own target, so it is  uncertain that it can't be forecasted and controlled.  A single agent can try to impose some controls upon other agents, which just like  the effects that other agents imposed upon the single one.  Multi  agent can take a more cooperative manner to take actions  synchronously through supplying one another with information.  Based  on the analyzing of classical plan method, and considering the  characteristics of equipment guarantee C**3I system, this treatise  puts forward the SAPP(Self-Adapt Partial Plan), which is fit for  multi agent's cooperating in dynamic conditions, and this  cooperating method has been used in the cooperating of the equipment guarantee C**3I system which is a multi agent.  5 Refs.

Title: Reliable agent communication - A pragmatic perspective
Abstract: It is well recognized that Agent Communication Languages (ACL's) are  critical elements of Multi-Agent Systems and a key to their  successful application in commerce and industry.  The established  field of protocol engineering, which concerns itself with how to  specify machine communication languages and protocols, verify their  properties and validate implementations thereof, has developed  powerful theoretical and practical techniques for doing so, and a  mature understanding of the essential requirements that such  specifications should meet.  Regrettably, this body of knowledge and  practice appears to have had little influence on recently proposed  ACL standards.  For example, the latest ACL specifications proposed  by the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) are a  confusing mix of different formal and informal specification  techniques whose net result is ambiguous, inconsistent and  under-specified.  Allowances must be made, as these are still draft  specifications, but rather than providing a verified foundation for  reliable communication between heterogeneous agents, they run the  risk of leading to unreliable or incompatible implementations, or of being ignored in favour of more pragmatic and robust approaches.  In  this paper, we propose a set of basic requirements which an ACL  specification should meet, describe how the FIPA ACL measures up  against these, and contrast its features with those of a small ACL  which was designed with reliability and ease of verification as  prime objectives.  25 Refs.

Title: Video-based multi-agent traffic surveillance system
Abstract: This paper describes Monitorix, a video-based traffic surveillance multi-agent system.  Monitorix agents are grouped in four tiers, according to the kind of information processing they perform: the sensors and effectors tier, the objective description tier, the application assistant tier, and the user assistant tier.  The video analysis algorithms use an adaptive, data-driven, application independent approach to extract features from the video raw data.  In spite of the diversity of agent tasks, adaptive learning algorithms are used in most cases.  The integration of video analysis algorithms and agent technology is made via a special middle agent called Proxy.  Monitorix is a fully decentralised multi-agent system living in a FIPA Platform and using FIPA Agent Communication Language.  Tracking of vehicles across non-overlapping cameras is performed by the Tracker agent, using a traffic model and learning algorithms that tune the model parameters

Title: Multiagent-based reservation of backup virtual paths in ATM networks
Abstract: In order to make the ATM network faulttolerant and the network  service flexible, a method for the setting up of backup virtual  paths (VP's for short) using multiagents is effective with respect  to adaptability to change of network resource and user requirements, examples of which are failure of nodes and links and addition of  VP's, respectively.  In this method, under the assumption that  candidates of backup VP's between different pairs of source and  destination nodes are given, the optimum backup VP's are obtained by exchanging information among agents autonomously.  First, this paper  proposes measures for determining backup VP's between different  pairs of source and destination nodes.  Next, this paper presents  simulation results to evaluate the adaptability of the method.  The  results show that the method efficiently obtains the optimum backup  VP's even when the number of backup VP's increases and that  different idle time at each destination node enables to shorten the  total processing time while keeping complete detection of shared  links.  12 Refs.

Title: A model of partially observable state game and its optimality
Abstract: In this paper we present a model of two-players partially observable  "state-game" and study its optimality.  The model is inspired by the  practical problem of negotiation in a multi-agent system and  formulates, from a the game theory point of view, the so-called  contract net protocol.  It covers a wide variety of real problems  including some simple card games such as blackjack, and many  negotiation and bargaining situations.  The results that follow are  valid for non-zero-sum games as well as for zero-sum games.   Basically, we establish and prove the relation between partially  observable state games and some classical (single-state) bi-matrix  games.  If the original state game is zero-sum, then the equivalent  bi-matrix game is so.  30 Refs.

Title: Pheromone robotics
Abstract: We describe techniques for coordinating the actions of large numbers  of small-scale robots to achieve useful large-scale results in  surveillance, reconnaissance, hazard detection, and path finding.   Inspired by the chemical markers used by insects for communication  and coordination, we exploit the notion of a "virtual pheromone,"  implemented using simple beacons and directional sensors mounted on  each robot.  Virtual pheromones facilitate simple communication and  coordination and require little on-board processing.  Our virtual  pheromone technique enables a robot collective to become a  distributed computing mesh embedded within the environment, while  simultaneously acting as a physical embodiment of the user  interface.  This leads to notions of world embedded computation and  world embedded interfaces that provide new ways to think about robot colonies.  20 Refs.

Title: A framework for modeling agent-oriented software
Abstract: With the increasing importance of complex software systems in the  software industry, the need for using agent technologies to develop  large-scale commercial and industrial software systems is growing  rapidly.  Such systems are complex and there is a pressing need for  system modeling techniques to support reliable, maintainable and  extensible design.  G-Nets are a type of Petri net defined to support modeling of a system as a set of independent and loosely-coupled  modules.  In this paper, we first introduce an extension of G-Nets,  agent-based G-Net, as a generic model for agent design.  Then to  progress from an agent-based design model to an agent-oriented  model, new mechanisms to support inheritance modeling are  introduced.  To illustrate our formal modeling technique for  multi-agent systems, an example of an agent family in electronic  commerce is provided.  12 Refs.

Title: Interfaces for understanding multi-agent behavior
Abstract: Synchronized punch-card displays are an interface technique to  visualize tens of thousands of variables by encoding their values as color chips in a rectangular array.  Our technique ties multiple such displays to a timeline of events enabling the punch-card displays to show animations of the behavior of complex systems.  Punch-card  displays not only make it easy to understand the high-level behavior of systems, but also enable users to quickly focus on individual  variables and on fine-grained time intervals.  This paper describes  synchronized punch-card displays and shows how this technique is  extremely powerful for understanding the behavior of complex  multi-agent systems.  7 Refs.

Title: Creating tangible interfaces by augmenting physical objects with  multimodal language
Abstract: Rasa is a tangible augmented reality environment that digitally  enhances the existing paper-based command and control capability in  a military command post.  By observing and understanding the users'  speech, pen, and touch-based multimodal language, Rasa  computationally augments the physical objects on a command post map, linking these items to digital representations of the same - for  example, linking a paper map to the world and Post-it trademark  notes to military units.  Herein, we give a thorough account of  Rasa's underlying multiagent framework, and its recognition,  understanding, and multimodal integration components.  Moreover, we  examine five properties of language - generativity,  comprehensibility, compositionality, referentiality, and, at times,  persistence - that render it suitable as an augmentation approach,  contrasting these properties to those of other augmentation methods.  It is these properties of language that allow users of Rasa to  augment physical objects, transforming them into tangible  interfaces.  17 Refs.

Abstract: More and more people combine several purposes with travelling, such  as business, leisure, entertainment, and education.

The EU funded research  project CRUMPET addresses these factors and will provide new  information delivery services for a far more heterogeneous tourist  population.  The services proposed by CRUMPET take advantage of  integrating four key emerging technology domains and applying them  to the tourism domain: location-aware services, personalised user  interaction, seamlessly accessible multi-media mobile communication, and smart component-based middleware or 'smartware' that uses  Multi-Agent Technology.  7 Refs.

Title: The limits of heart-model-based computerized ECG diagnosis
Abstract: Nowadays the most important health problem affecting large groups of  people is related to the malfunctions of the heart, usually caused  by heart attack, rhythm disturbances and pathological degenerations.  The main goal is to predict this kind of tragical events, and by  identifying the patients situated in the most dangerous states, it  is possible to apply a preventing therapy.  This paper presents the  description of the heart's function using a mathematical model, in  order to recognize the dangerous states.  The developed system  applies three different models to obtain the diagnostics: a cell  model, heart model, and chest model.  The development of these models is not finished yet, important and surprising new appear every day.   Because the computerized "understanding" and simulation of these  physiological processes require lots of unknown parameters, it is  suitable to apply stochastic processing methods.  The methods refer  to several physiological problems, like the contraction of the  heart, the respiration, the state of the patient, etc.   Unfortunately, the printed and electronical literature is often  unpuncual, which makes the implementation of such a system harder.   11 Refs.

Title: On dynamically generated ontology translators in agent communication
Abstract: In this paper, we consider communication between agents that employ  different vocabularies to represent information.  In particular, we  develop a communication mechanism in which translators between the  vocabularies of agents are generated.  Instead of being defined in  advance, these translators are dynamically constructed during  execution of the system, and are based both on the information that  the agents exchange and on their underpinning ontologies.  Moreover,  these translators are not necessarily defined for the total  vocabulary of the agents, but instead, only for the parts that have  been involved in communication steps.  The framework can for instance be used to study and to analyze experiments as performed in the  research on the origins of language, like language games, in which  the purpose of communication is to come to a mutual understanding of the agents' vocabularies.  23 Refs.

Title: Multiagent design architecture for intelligent synthesis environment
Abstract: The intelligent synthesis environment (ISE) represents the  integration of a broad range of high-fidelity knowledge at the  design stage to facilitate the product realization process.  ISE has  the potential of reducing the product realization time by several  orders of magnitude.  The key characteristics of ISE are integrated  evaluation of product life-cycle stages in a virtual environment,  coordination of a asynchronous design activities, design  configuration selection based on multiple design criteria, and  interoperability among heterogeneous software and hardware  environments to accomplish an effective collaborative computational  system.  Multiagent design architecture (MADA) is designed to provide a flexible integration framework for ISE.  This architecture provides seamless integration of product realization activities across  heterogenous machines, computing platforms, programming languages,  data, and process representations using distributed intelligent  agents.  An agent in the context of MADA is an autonomous  computational entity that is capable of migrating across computing  environments asynchronously.  These agents have intelligence in the  form of individual goals, beliefs, learning mechanisms and interact  cooperatively to accomplish overall product design objectives.  An  application of the MADA information framework for the design of  aerospace components is presented.  Specifically, the use of  integrated design and analysis tools for creating a high-speed civil transport exhaust nozzle is demonstrated.  17 Refs.

Title: Modular Q-learning based multi-agent cooperation for robot soccer
Abstract: In a multi-agent system, action selection is important for the  cooperation and coordination among agents.  As the environment is  dynamic and complex, modular Q-learning, which is one of the  reinforcement learning schemes, is employed in assigning a proper  action to an agent in the multi-agent system.  The architecture of  modular Q-learning consists of learning modules and a mediator  module.  The mediator module of the modular Q-learning system selects a proper action for the agent based on the Q-value obtained from  each learning module.  To obtain better performance, along with the  Q-value, the mediator module also considers the state information in the action selection process.  A uni-vector field is used for robot  navigation.  In the robot soccer environment, the effectiveness and  applicability of modular Q-learning and the uni-vector field method  are verified by real experiments using five micro-robots. copy 2001  Elsevier Science B.V.  16 Refs.

Title: Modelling a society of simple agents: From conceptual specification  to experimentation
Abstract: Much research concerning the design of multi-agent systems (at a conceptual level) addresses complex agents that exhibit complex  interaction patterns. Due to this complexity, it is difficult to  perform rigorous experimentation.  On the other hand, systematic  experimental work regarding behaviour of societies of more simple  agents, while reporting valuable results, often lacks conceptual specification of the system under consideration.  In this paper, the  compositional multi-agent modelling framework DESIRE is not only  successfully used to develop a conceptual specification of the  simple agents discussed by A. Cesta, M. Miceli and P. Rizzo (Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, vol.  1038, Springer-Verlag: Berlin, pp.  128-138, 1996), but also to simulate the behaviour in a  dynamical environment.  In the DESIRE framework, a conceptual  specification, which provides a high-level view of an agent, has  enough detail for automatic prototype generation. The prototype  implementation of the conceptual specification of the simple agents has been used to replicate, and extend, one of the experiments  reported by Cesta et al

Title: Applying Logic Programming to knowledge discovery on the internet
Abstract: LP (Logic Programming) has been successfully applied to knowledge  discovery in many fields.  The execution of the LP is based on the  evaluation of the first order predicate.  Usually the information  involved in the predicates are local and homogenous, thus the  evaluation process is relatively simple.  However, the evaluation  process become much more complicated when applied to KDD on the  Internet where the information involved in the predicates maybe  heterogeneous and distributed over many different sits.  Therefore,  we try to attack the problem in a multi-agent system's framework so  that the logic program can be written in a site-independent style  and deal easily with heterogeneous represented information.  11 Refs.

Title: Security enhanced mobile agents
Abstract: This paper describes a security model for mobile agent based systems.  The model defines the notion of a security-enhanced agent and  outlines security management components in agent platform bases and  considers secure migration of agents from one base to another.  The  security enhanced agent carries a passport that contains its  security credentials and some related security code.  Then we  describe how authentication, integrity and confidentiality, and  access control are achieved using the agent's passport and the  security infrastructure in the agent bases.  We also consider the  types of access control policies that can be specified using the  security enhanced agents and the policy base in the agent platforms.  We discuss the application of the security model in roaming mobile  agents and consider a simple scenario involving security auditing in networks.  11 Refs.

Title: Improved information sharing method for multiple autonomous mobile  robot systems using one to one bidirectional proximity communication
Abstract: An essential task for a multiple autonomous mobile robot system is to search for and to gather objects.  To accomplish such a task  effectively, it is essential that all the agents share common  information on locations of objects, comrade agents and the place to deposit the objects.  The authors have proposed a method called  "COMPASS" to realize this only using two functions of each agent -  to estimate the location of the objects by dead reckoning and to  exchange the information each other by one to one bidirectional  proximity communication.  In this paper, a new concept "figure of  confidence (foc)" is introduced to the COMPASS for higher  performance and additional capability.  The foc is a self-estimated  measure for accuracy of information in each agent.  Using the foc,  agents can accelerate information sharing and handle multiple object without significantly increasing complexity of the algorithm.  The  validity of foc is confirmed through computer simulations.  8 Refs.

Title: Expertness measuring in cooperative learning
Abstract: Cooperative Learning in a multi-agent system can improve the learning quality and learning speed.  The improvement can be gained if each  agent detects the expert agents and use their knowledge properly.  In this paper, a new cooperative learning method, called Weighted  Strategy Sharing (WSS) is introduced.  Also some criteria are  introduced to measure the expertness of agents.  In WSS, based on the amount of its teammate expertness, each agent assigns a weight to  their knowledge.  These weights are used in sharing knowledge among  agents in our system.  WSS and the expertness criteria are tested on  two simulated Hunter-Prey problem and Object pushing systems.  17  Refs.

Title: Complexity reduction of a rational general form
Abstract: This paper is motivated by the fact that application of B-spline and fuzzy techniques are popular engineering tools, however, their use is restricted by their exponential complexity.  The main goals of this paper is to define a complexity reduction algorithm to the general form adopted in fuzzy logic and B-spline techniques.  The key idea of this work is to store the huge number of parameters of the general form in a special compressed form done in off-line in that way that, the decompression can then be executed by the same general form in on-line, and enables us to regenerate not the whole parameter array, but only those parameters that are necessary to be considered.  This idea is supported by the recently published fuzzy rule base reduction approach based on singular value decomposition.   An example showing the effectiveness of the SVD reduction will be presented.

Title: A fast analysis method based on exponential expansion of Green's  function for large multilayer structures
Abstract: In this paper a fast algorithm for MOM solution of Integral equations for multilayer structures is presented.  This approach is based on  exponential expansion of a spatial domain Green's function for a  multilayered media.  The spatial domain Green's function for a  multilayered media is given by a closed form expression using the  method of complex images.  The complex image representation is then  expanded in a series of plane waves, including both the propagation  and evanescent modes.  This method is used to speed up the solution  of the large matrix equations resulting from the method of moments  (MOM) in low frequency applications.  7 Refs.

Title: Transformed-space non-uniform pseudo-spectral time domain (NU-PSTD)  algorithm without the use of the non-uniform FFT
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new non-uniform pseudo-spectral time  domain (NUPSTD) method for electromagnetic applications, in which we transform a non-uniform grid left brace x//i right brace into a  uniform one left brace u//i right brace before applying the fast  Fourier transform (FFT) to obtain the spatial derivatives.  The  transformed spatial derivatives are subsequently converted back to  the real space via the use of interpolation formulas.  The resultant  scheme differs from the uniform PSTD algorithm only by a single  factor of du/dx and has a computational complexity of O(NlogN);  hence, it preserves the efficiency of the uniform scheme.  We  demonstrate the application of the new method by considering the  test case of a single dielectric slab.  The computed results are in  excellent agreement with the analytical solution up to frequencies  for which the discretization size is only 3 cells per wavelength.  5  Refs.

Title: A simplified 3D plane wave time domain (PWTD) algorithm
Abstract: A simplified 3D plane wave time domain (PWTD) algorithm is presented.  Fast evaluation of transient wave fields generated by known  bandlimited sources is possible as PWTD schemes constitute  extensions of frequency domain (Helmholtz equation) fast multipole  methods to the time domain (wave equation).  The new scheme provides  for a simplified translational operator and it relies on uniform  spherical sampling of far-field signatures.  Less memory is required  without sacrificing computational complexity and the new scheme is  easily extended to environments other than free space.  It has been  observed that the numerical errors incurred by the modified scheme  can be controlled and made arbitrarily small.  (Edited abstract) 2  Refs.

Title: Skew detection and compensation for internet audio applications
Abstract: Long lived audio streams, such as music broadcasts, and small  differences in clock rates lead to buffer undertow or overflow  events in receiving applications that manifest themselves as audible interruptions.  We present a low complexity algorithm for detecting  clock skew in network audio applications that function with local  clocks and in the absence of a synchronization mechanism.  A  companion algorithm to perform skew compensation is also presented.   The compensation algorithm utilises the temporal redundancy inherent in audio streams to make inaudible playout adjustments.  Both  algorithms have been implemented in a simulator and in a network  audio application.  They perform effectively over the range of  observed clock rate differences and beyond.  13 Refs.

Title: Joint downlink beamforming, power control, and data rate allocation  for DS-CDMA mobile radio with multimedia services
Abstract: Power control and rate allocation are two fundamental issues for  improving the spectrum efficiency of downlink transmission for  wireless multimedia communications.  Downlink beamforming, on the  other hand, can be used to suppress stronger interference induced by high rate users, thereby improving the system performance.  In this  paper, we present a joint downlink beamforming, power control and  rate allocation technique suitable for DS-CDMA systems with  multimedia services.  To simplify the computational complexity, a  practical rate allocation algorithm is also proposed.  Computer  simulation results are given to evaluate downlink capacity of  DS-CDMA systems using base station antenna and the new algorithm  proposed in this paper.  4 Refs.

Title: Genetic adaptive IIR filtering algorithm for active noise control 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive infinite impulse response (IIR) filtering algorithm using genetic algorithm for active noise control (ANC). Feedforward ANC systems are equivalent to system identification configuration whose reference model has infinite impulse response and input signal is colored.  Stochastic gradient algorithms such as filtered-x least mean square (FXLMS) algorithm are conventionally used for their simplicity and stability.  But these algorithms have disadvantages of local minimum and large eigenvalue disparity of input signal's autocorrelation matrix. To solve those problems we propose an IIR structure ANC algorithm with genetic algorithm which well known as global optimization tools in control and signal processing area.  Computer simulation shows that genetic IIR algorithm is superior to LMS IIR algorithm for insufficient case.

Title: Video access control via multi-level data hiding
Abstract: This paper proposes novel data hiding algorithms and system design  for high quality digital video.  Instead of targeting on a single  degree of robustness, which results in overestimation and/or  underestimation of the noise conditions, we apply multi-level  embedding to digital video to achieve more than one level of  robustness-capacity tradeoff.  In addition, an adaptive technique is  proposed to determine how many bits are embedded in each part of the video.  Besides user data, control information such as  synchronization and the number of hidden user bits are embedded as  well.  The proposed algorithm can be used for applications such as  access control.  8 Refs.

Title: An advanced center biased three step search algorithm for motion  estimation
Abstract: Recent studies show that the motion vector distribution within the  search window shows a center biased behaviour.  Based on this fact,  an advanced center biased three step search algorithm for fast block motion estimation has been proposed in this paper.  The algorithm  drastically reduces the computational complexity by strict  application of the Unimodal Error Surface Assumption.  Improved error performance has been achieved by an efficient center biased search  strategy that improves the chance of getting correct motion vector.   Half stop technique has been adopted to speed up the block matching  process.  Experimental results show that proposed algorithm has  improved performance as compared to the original three step search  algorithm.  A good predicted image quality is also achieved.  14 Refs.

Title: A novel method for partially adaptive broadband beamforming
Abstract: In this paper, a novel subband-selective generalized sidelobe  canceller (GSC) for partially adaptive broadband beamforming is  proposed.  The blocking matrix of the GSC is constructed such that  its columns constitute a series of bandpass filters, which select  signals with specific direction of arrival angles and frequencies.   This results in bandlimited spectra of the blocking matrix outputs,  which is further exploited by subband decomposition and discarding  the low-pass subbands appropriately prior to running independent  unconstrained adaptive filters in each non-redundant subband.  We  also discuss the design of both the blocking matrix and the filter  banks for the subsequent subband decomposition.  By these steps, the  computational complexity of our subband-selective GSC is greatly  reduced compared to other adaptive GSC schemes, while performance is comparable or even enhanced due to subband decorrelation, as  simulations indicate.  17 Refs.

Title: Error resilience schemes for digital terrestrial TV broadcasting  system
Abstract: In this paper, an error resilient scheme incorporated with MPEG-2  standard is developed to support robust video transmission in  digital terrestrial TV broadcasting (DTTB) systems.  Specially, a  novel concealment algorithm based on temporal error concealment and  block-matching methodology is proposed.  This algorithm achieves an  effective concealment while keeping low computational complexity  with small size of search-window for block-matching.  Likewise, an  effective reception for isolate I-pictures is developed.  Moreover,  combining with an efficient detection of spatial/temporal activity,  an adaptive error concealment scheme is further contrived.  Extensive simulations have confirmed that the proposed error resilient schemes may achieve efficient and robust video transmission in a DTTB system even with a very high packet error rate.  11 Refs.

Title: Power reduction for ASIPs: A case study
Abstract: Application specific instruction set processors (ASIPs) are an  excellent architecture for mixed control/data-flow oriented tasks  with medium to low data rate and high complexity.  The main advantage of ASIPs is the higher flexibility due to programmability compared  to dedicated hardware.  A drawback of this design style is an  increase in power consumption.  The current case study focuses on an  ASIP design methodology considering the classical parameters  computational performance and area as well as energy consumption  simultaneously.  Several ASIP power optimization options have been  applied and evaluated: clock-gating, logic netlist restructuring,  ISA optimization, instruction memory power reduction, and use of a  dedicated coprocessor.  These optimizations are demonstrated with the ICORE (ISS-core) ASIP for DVB-T acquisition and tracking algorithms.  The results reveal a potential of about one order of magnitude in  energy savings for these optimizations.  16 Refs.

Title: A very low-cost multi-mode Reed Solomon decoder based on  Peterson-Gorenstein-Zierler algorithm
Abstract: Reed-Solomon (RS) codes play an important role in providing error  protection and data integrity.  Among various RS decoding algorithms, the Peterson-Gorenstein-Zierler (PGZ) in general has the least  computational complexity for small t values.  However, unlike the  iterative approaches (e.g., Berlekamp-Massey algorithm), it will  encounter divided-by-zero problems in solving multiple t values.  In  this paper, we propose a multi-mode hardware architecture for error  number ranging from zero to three.  We first propose a cost-down  techniques to reduce the hardware complexity of a t=3 decoder.  Then, we perform algorithmic-level derivation to identify the configurable feature of our design.  With the manipulations, we are able to  perform multi-mode RS decoding in one unified VLSI architecture with very simple control scheme.  The very low cost and simple datapath  make our design a good choice in small-footprint embedded VLSI  systems such as Error Control Coding (ECC) in memory systems.  7  Refs.

Title: VLSI implementation-oriented (3,k)-regular low-density parity-check  codes
Abstract: In the past few years, Gallager's Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC)  codes received a lot of attention and many efforts have been devoted to analyze and improve their error-correcting performance.  However,  little consideration has been given to the LDPC decoder VLSI  implementation.  The straightforward fully parallel decoder  architecture usually incurs too high complexity for many practical  purposes and should be transformed to a partly parallel realization.  Unfortunately, due to the randomness of LDPC codes, it's nearly  impossible to develop an effective transformation for an arbitrary  given LDPC code.  In this paper, we propose a joint code and decoder  design approach to construct a class of (3,k)-regular LDPC codes  which exactly fit to a partly parallel decoder implementation and  have a very good performance.  Moreover, for such LDPC codes, we  propose a systematic efficient encoding scheme by effectively  exploiting the sparseness of its parity check matrix.  8 Refs.

Title: Region-of-interest coding based on set partitioning in hierarchical  trees
Abstract: In many image coding applications such as web browsing, image  database, and telemedicine, it is useful to reconstruct only a  region of interest (ROI) before the rest of the image is  reconstructed.  In this paper, an ROI coding functionality is  incorporated with the set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) algorithm [1] .  By emphasizing the ROI  coefficients, they are coded with higher fidelity than the rest of  the image in early stages of progressive reconstruction.  The main  thrust of this research is how to identify necessary coefficients  for the decoder to reconstruct the desired region.  The proposed  method provides better performance than the previous method.  6 Refs.

Title: A new fast lower-tree wavelet image encoder
Abstract: During the last decade a lot of research and develop efforts have  been made to design competitive still image coders for several kinds of applications.  In this paper, we present a new wavelet still-image coder, called LTW (Lower-Tree Wavelet), based on the construction  and codification of coefficient trees as other proposals do.  This  algorithm is fast and symmetric (except in extremely low bit rates), which makes it adequate for real-time interactive multimedia  applications.  We have compared our algorithm with several well-known coders in terms of rate/distortion performance using the standard  Lena image.  Results show that LTW, with lower temporal complexity,  achieves better results than EZW (0.8 dB PSNR) and stack-run (0.13  dB).  Also, we have tested the temporal complexity of LTW algorithm,  resulting 3.5 times faster than an optimized EZW.  5 Refs.

Title: A new method for boundary artefact reduction in JPEG 2000
Abstract: It is well known that tile boundary artefacts occur in wavelet-based  lossy image coding.  However until now their cause has not been well  understood.  In this paper, we show that boundary artefacts are an  intrinsic feature associated with the common method used to choose  the tile size and the type of symmetric extension employed in  wavelet-based image decomposition.  A novel method of reducing tile  boundary artefacts is presented.  This method has recently been  adopted as part of the JPEG 2000 Verification Model.  In this  technique, odd tile sizes of 2**N + 1 are chosen rather than the  conventional even tile sizes of 2**N.  We show that, for the same  bit-rate, an image compressed using odd tile length and low pass  first convention (OTLPF) has significantly less boundary artefacts  than an image compressed using even tile sizes.  6 Refs.

Title: Optimum intra/inter partitioning for video compression in the wavelet domain
Abstract: In this paper we propose a low-complexity, wavelet transform based  video codec that transmits composite frames that include both intra- and inter-frame regions.  Intra/inter partitioning is performed with  the goal of minimising the error in the decoded video sequence.  The  image is partitioned in the wavelet domain by selecting combinations of spatially oriented coefficient trees.  We evaluate a simple  selection method based on comparison of tree variance.  Optimal  partitions can be found using a steepest descent search of the  combination space, though this is computationally expensive.  Results demonstrate that optimal intra/inter partitioning provides a  significant improvement in objective and subjective quality when  compared to a conventional interframe codec.  5 Refs.

Title: Multistage adaptive prediction using local area based predictor  evaluation
Abstract: An efficient and robust approach to adaptive prediction is presented  which uses a local causal area to evaluate a number of individual  fixed sub-predictors.  Various schemes are proposed to utilise this  information, including a rank-order based approach, a two stage  adaptive selection technique utilising median filtering, a technique for adaptive combination and a technique incorporating adaptive  selection followed by adaptive combination.  The respective selection and combination schemes display superior results for particular  image types which, coupled with prediction error feedback and  adaptive arithmetic coding, produce results superior to CALIC.  To  produce a more robust predictor a secondary stage based on one of  the proposed selection schemes is applied resulting in an adaptive  prediction scheme which effectively utilises the principles of  predictor combination and selection.  8 Refs.

(2) The predicted values are obtained with shift  operation, addition, and/or subtraction.  (3) The predictor  coefficients sum up to 1. The comparison of the total squared error  between the simple predictors and the optimum predictors obtained by solving the normal equations is discussed in a theoretical  viewpoint.  With the results of theoretical analysis, we proposed a  six-predictor and an eleven-predictor set.  The performance of the  proposed predictors on actual images is also presented.  7 Refs.

Title: New DCT computation algorithm for video quality scaling
Abstract: The application of video coding systems such as MPEG in portable  systems like organizers and mobile phones, can be scaled down to  reduced complexity that matches with the desired video quality  and/or display.  In this paper, a new DCT computation algorithm is  presented, based on an analysis for optimizing the amount of  computations involved at each computing stage, using existing fast  DCT calculation algorithms.  The analysis is used to scale down the  video quality, thereby lowering the computing power and resource  usage.  Compared to a diagonally oriented computation of coefficients that matches with the conventional MPEG scanning, a 2-4 SNR dB  improvement is obtained when scaling down the video quality to  halved computing resources.  5 Refs.

Title: Block-based segmentation and adaptive coding for visually lossless  compression of scanned documents
Abstract: This paper presents a novel block-based segmentation and adaptive  coding (BSAC) algorithm for visually lossless compression of scanned documents that contain not only photographic images but also text  and graphic images.  For such compound image source, we structure the image into non-overlapping blocks and classify each block into four  different classes based on the empirical statistics within the  block.  Different coding strategies are applied to different classes  in order to achieve the very best compression performance.  Our new  block-based image coder is able to provide visually lossless  compression of scanned documents at the bit rate of around 1 similar to 1.5bpp with modest computational complexity and very low memory  requirement.  10 Refs.

Title: On the study of lossless compression of computer generated compound  images
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of lossless compression of computer  generated compound images that contain not only photographic images  but also text and graphic images.  We present a simple backward  adaptive classification scheme to separate the image source into  three classes: smooth regions, text regions and image regions.   Different probability models are assigned within each class to  maximize the compression performance.  We also extend our scheme to  exploit the interplane dependency for coding color images.  The  segmentation results of the reference color plane are used as the  contexts for the classification and coding of the current color  plane.  Our new lossless coder significantly outperforms current  state-of-the-art coders such as CALIC and JPEG-LS for compound  images with modest computational complexity.  9 Refs.

Title: JPEG-matched MRC compression of compound documents
Abstract: Mixed Raster Content (MRC) is an ITU document compression standard  (T.44) specifying both a model for multilayer representation of a  compound document, and a set of allowable standardized coders for  the individual layers.  The model requires decomposition of a  document into two image layers and a binary mask layer, but the  standard does not recommend any procedure for this task.  For best  compression results, the decomposition method should be optimized  for the layer encoders.  In this paper, a high performance MRC  compound document codec is presented, where the layer decomposition  scheme is matched to the JPEG encoder with arithmetic coding for the foreground and background image layers.  JBIG is used to code the  mask layer.  Integrated noise removal routines enable handling of  scanned documents along with electronic ones.  Resolution scalable  decoding features are also implemented.  The page segmenter yields a  segmentation mask, which serves to separate text and other features.  8 Refs.

Title: Predicting the complexity of signal processing algorithms
Abstract: Predicting the complexity of signal processing task is a very  difficult subject, mainly because the notion of complexity itself is not well defined.  In this work we propose to link the complexity to  the predicted execution of an algorithm on a given platform or  processor.  To do so branches, arithmetic and memory operations are  classified into different types of category.  Then the number of time operations of each category are executed is computed for the studied algorithm.  Finally weights depending on the underlying architecture  are used to sum up the contribution of each categories to get the  final complexity.  Typical weights for two Pentium processors are  presented and the validity of the prediction is verified for the  case of a simple algorithm.  7 Refs.

Title: On-chip computation of Euler number of a binary image for efficient  database search
Abstract: Euler number is a fundamental topological feature of an image, which  remains invariant under translation, rotation, scaling, and  rubber-sheet transformation of the image.  In this work, a novel  algorithm for computing the Euler number of a binary image is  proposed which is based on the properties of runs of 0's and 1's  present in the pixel matrix.  The algorithm outperforms significantly the existing techniques in terms of both the number of pixel  accesses and CPU time.  It can be easily parallelized, and a simple  on-chip implementation is reported here.  Results on a database  consisting of 1039 logo images reveal that Euler number has a strong discriminatory power, and hence can be used for efficient database  searching or matching of binary images.  The proposed algorithm is  very fast and easy to implement, and has potential of wide  applicability in image processing.  6 Refs.

Title: Joint mesh and texture compression using marginal analysis
Abstract: In many computer graphic applications, a texture is mapped onto a  meshed surface.  Under complexity constraints, both texture and mesh  need to be approximated.  In this paper, we present a framework for  the joint simplification of texture and mesh with respect to an  error measure in screen space.  In order to achieve optimal operating points, we choose two efficient simplification algorithms: Optimal  multiresolution mesh simplification based on a quadtree structure  and multiresolution view-dependent texture compression based on  wavelets.  Together, these two algorithms are used for joint  simplification using an efficient heuristic based on marginal  analysis.  As an application example, we study the mapping of aerial  orthophotographs onto a terrain model of the swiss alps, and show  that the resolution of the terrain and the aerial photograph is  efficiently traded-off.  6 Refs.

The following crossover filter optimization is based on frequency sampling method in the weighted least-mean-squared sense.

Title: Robust and scalable video compression using matching pursuits and  absolute value coding
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to develop a fine grained  scalable video codec which can fully exploit temporal correlation's  within all layers, and thus offer performance closer to that of a  single layer non-scalable system.  To this end we propose the use of  a combination of matching pursuits together with absolute value  coding of the displaced frame difference information.  The proposed  codec is also shown to be highly robust to channel errors.  This  results from a combination of the use of fixed length code-words and a reduction of temporal error propagation.  The use of fixed length  code-words also facilitates the use of lower complexity transcoding  operations to support more sophisticated forms of scalability.  6  Refs.

Title: Complexity-adaptive search algorithm for block motion estimation
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a complexity-adaptive fast block matching  algorithm design strategy that allows user to terminate algorithm at any target computational complexity.  Two complexity-adaptive  techniques, frame level complexity allocation and block level  complexity allocation, are developed to approach the global  complexity-distortion optimization.  A buffer control strategy is  proposed to dynamically adjust the target complexity of one frame.   The predictive complexity-distortion benefit list (PCDB list)  technique is employed to allocate the target complexity into each  block.  By these techniques, we modify the full-search block  matching, three-step search, new three-step search, and four-step  search to the complexity-adaptive algorithms.  Experimental results  show that the complexity-adaptive algorithms could achieve better  performance than traditional fixed algorithms from the viewpoint of  complexity-distortion optimization.  6 Refs.

Title: Efficient motion estimation using edge-based binary block-matching  and refinement based on motion vector correlation
Abstract: A fast block-matching motion estimation algorithm is proposed for  efficient hardware implementation in video coding standards.  The  proposed algorithm consists of the binary block-matching (BBM) step  based on edge information, the first refinement step around the  motion vector (MV) obtained from BBM, and the second but conditional refinement step using spatial correlation of neighboring MVs.  The  proposed algorithm gives the PSNR performance similar to that of the full search.  Moreover, due to BBM and the fact that the refinement  steps and the half-pel search perform the same operation, its  hardware implementation can be performed with several prospective  features such as small number of gates, low power consumption, and  short critical path delay, etc. 9 Refs.

Title: A hybrid frequency-space domain algorithm for estimating projective  transformations of color images
Abstract: This paper makes two important contributions to the estimation of  projective transformations.  First, it presents a new algorithm for  estimating these transformations between pairs of color images; a  frequency-domain algorithm initially estimates an affine  approximation to the actual projective transformation relating the  two images; a space-domain algorithm then computes the projective  transformation parameters through an iterative procedure where the  affine approximation is used as the starting-point.  Second, it  provides a discussion on the role played by color in the estimation  of projective transformations by testing the proposed algorithm in  various color spaces and by suggesting the solutions which allow the best trade-off between estimate accuracy and computational  complexity.  11 Refs.

Title: A secure watermarking for JPEG-2000
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based  watermarking method, which can be conveniently integrated in  up-comming JPEG-2000 baseline.  Conventional DWT based watermarking  techniques insert a watermark into the coefficients after the  transform completed, while the proposed method inserts a watermark  into the coefficients obtained from ongoing process of lifting for  DWT.  The proposed method allows us to determine selectivity  frequency characteristics of the coefficients where watermark is  embedded, so that the watermark cannot be easily removed or altered  even when filter-banks for DWT was known.  Through the simulations,  we show that the proposed method is more secure and more robust  against various attacks than the conventional DWT based  watermarking.  9 Refs.

Abstract: In this paper, a type of lapped biorthogonal transform that can map  integers to integers is considered.  Based on the computational  structure of the proposed lapped transform, an efficient  multiplierless algorithm for the lapped biorthogonal transform  (LBT), called integer lapped biorthogonal transform (IntLBT), is  proposed.  The proposed IntLBT is implemented by a series of dyadic  lifting steps, and provides fast, efficient computation of the  transform coefficients as well as the ability to map integers to  integers.  Application of the novel IntLBT in lossy image coding  gains very competitive results comparing to the performance of the  much more complex Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau (CDF) 9/7-tap  biorthogonal wavelet with irrational coefficients.  10 Refs.

Title: A novel search algorithm based on L//2-norm pyramid of codewords for  fast vector quantization encoding
Abstract: Vector quantization for image compression requires expensive encoding time to find the closest codeword to the input vector.  This paper  presents a fast algorithm to speed up the closest codeword search  process in vector quantization encoding.  By using an appropriate  topological structure of the codebook, we first derive a condition  to eliminate unnecessary matching operations from the search  procedure.  Then, based on this elimination condition, a fast search  algorithm is suggested.  Simulation results show that with little  preprocessing and memory cost, the proposed search algorithm  significantly reduces the encoding complexity while maintaining the  same encoding quality as that of the full search algorithm.  It is  also found that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing  search algorithms.  7 Refs.

Title: Adaptive image partitioning for fractal coding achieving designated  rates under a complexity constraint
Abstract: Fractal image coding is a relatively new technique for compact image  representation.  The basic coding scheme exploits self-similarities  between parts of the image and other parts in it at a different  resolution.  The various parts are consequences of a partition grid  obtained by applying a splitting criterion to the image.  In this  work, we present an algorithm for adaptive image partitioning,  achieving designated rates under a computational complexity  constraint.  The proposed algorithm results in a reduction of the  computational complexity as compared to other known algorithms at  the same rate-distortion operating point.  Also presented is an  efficient procedure for approximating parts in the image by a linear combination of two other parts in it and its combination with the  adaptive partitioning algorithm.  7 Refs.

Title: Adaptive entropy-constrained matching pursuit quantization
Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive entropy-constrained Matching Pursuit  coefficient quantization scheme.  The quantization scheme takes  benefit of the inherent properties of Matching Pursuit streams where coefficients energy decreases along with the iteration number.  The  decay rate can moreover be upper-bounded with an exponential curve  driven by the redundancy of the dictionary.  An optimal  entropy-constrained quantization scheme can thus be derived once the dictionary is known.  We propose here to approximate this optimal  quantization scheme by adaptive quantization of successive  coefficients whose actual values are used to update the quantization scheme parameters.  This new quantization scheme is shown to  outperform classical exponential quantization in the case of both  random dictionaries and practical image coding with Gabor  dictionaries.  12 Refs.

Abstract: A problem of speeding-up the fractal compression of still images is  discussed.  The techniques based on analysis of local variance for  range blocks and domain blocks are proposed and considered.  An  algorithm of fast search of domain blocks corresponding to range  block in the best manner is described.  It is shown that the  reduction of search CPU by several times can be provided and the  obtained benefit depends upon the complexity of image to be  compressed and the range block size.  The proposed procedure of  speeding up the fractal compression does not result in additional  losses in recovered image quality.  7 Refs.

Title: A low complexity wavelet transform with point-symmetric extension at  tile boundaries
Abstract: This paper presents a low-complexity wavelet transform that utilizes  the point-symmetric extension at the image tile boundaries.  The  proposed solution preserves the perfect reconstruction property of  the filter banks and deals efficiently with the blocking artifacts  when images are lossy compressed.  It is shown that the  point-symmetric extension at the tile boundaries does not need to be applied explicitly, but instead the equivalent boundary filters can  be derived.  The lifting-based implementation of the filters provides a very simple way of changing filter parameters at the boundaries  that suits both hardware and software platforms.  A new architecture  is proposed to perform wavelet transform of large images.  It  minimizes DSP's internal memory requirements as well as the external buffer bandwidth without producing sharp discontinuities between  tiles.  11 Refs.

Title: Genetic stereo matching using complex conjugate wavelet pyramids
Abstract: In this paper, a new genetic algorithm-based optimisation technique  for stereo matching using complex conjugate wavelet pyramids is  proposed.  Reliable disparity fields are estimated in the wavelet  domain with low computational cost.  The new cost function is  composed of the differences in wavelet coefficient values, plus  vertical discontinuity and ordering constraints.  Within homogeneous  regions, smoothness constraints on the disparity field are also  employed.  A genetic algorithm is used, where previously estimated  vectors at the former image hierarchy are used to predict the  corresponding search space of chromosomes, and to correct each newly calculated set of disparity vectors.  This significantly reduces  computational complexity compared to other methods, whilst  maintaining robust performance.  11 Refs.

Title: Interactive view synthesis from compressed light fields
Abstract: A light field is a collection of multi-view images which represent a  3-D scene.  Rendering from a light field provides a simple and  efficient way to generate arbitrary new views of the scene as the  viewing position and angle change, thus offering the experience of  immersive viewing.  The enormous amount of data required in a light  field poses a key challenge in rendering.  Tree-structured vector  quantization (TSVQ) provides moderate compression ratio of around  24:1, which alleviates but does not solve the problem.  Compression  schemes based on video coding techniques exploit the data redundancy very effectively, but do not provide adequate random access for  rendering.  This paper describes a new compression scheme that  supports interactive rendering directly from compressed light field  data.  The proposed algorithm provides a high compression ratio of as much as 10 times that of TSVQ, while only slowing down the rendering speed by a factor smaller than 2. 12 Refs.

Title: Constrained quantization algorithm for color images
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss two kinds of VQ algorithms.  One is based on minimizing the total variance and the other is based on minimizing  the maximum deviation.  The algorithms of the first kind better  reflect overall fit, but may discount large, but highly localized  deviations.  Those of the second kind provide absolute distance  bounds that are a useful error guarantee, but may be overly  sensitive to any noise that might be present in the original models.  A new algorithm, combining the two criteria, is presented in this  paper.  It not only improves the total variance, but also provides a  useful maximum error guarantee.  The experiments indicate the new  quantizer is a better choice in some practical operations.  28 Refs.

Title: An alternative complexity model for the MPEG-4 video verifier  mechanism
Abstract: MPEG-4 is the first object-based audiovisual coding standard.  To  control the minimum decoding complexity resources required at the  decoder, the MPEG-4 Visual standard defines the so-called Video  Complexity Verifier (VCV).  This paper proposes an alternative VCV  model, based on a set of relative macroblock (MB) complexity weights assigned to the various MB coding types used in MPEG-4 video coding.  The New VCV model allows a more efficient use of the available  decoding resources by preventing the over-evaluation of the decoding complexity of certain MB types and thus making possible to encode  scenes (for the same profile@level decoding resources) which  otherwise would be considered too requiring.  4 Refs.

Title: Optimizing a random system of cascaded video processing modules by  parallel evolution modeling
Abstract: Video processing algorithms tend to improve over time in terms of  image quality while increasing in implementation complexity.   Generally, video algorithms are developed and evaluated in isolation from the video processing system of which they will be a part, in a  consumer product.  The final image quality obtained by that system,  however, strongly depends on the interaction of its constituent  algorithms.  Current methods for optimizing the overall image quality are ad-hoc, time consuming and don't guarantee the best possible  result.  In this paper we propose a rapid and reliable method for  fine-tuning composite video processing systems based on genetic  algorithms (GAs).  The GAs method evolves toward a system  configuration that gives the best image quality, driven by an  objective video quality metric.  17 Refs.

Title: Picture-wise resource allocation in MPEG-2 decoding
Abstract: Past efforts in lowering the complexity of MPEG-2 decoding through  internal scaling or partial-quality decoding have led to video  quality degradation.  Improvement in degradation of quality can be  achieved at the expense of more computation resources.  In this  paper, we introduce the notion of picture-type-dependent (PTD)  processing where more computational resources are allocated to  pictures that contribute more to the overall video quality.   Specifically, we advocate decoding and processing more critical  pictures in MPEG-2 at higher quality while keeping the resource  allocation to non-critical pictures low.  Our simulation results show PTD is a very effective way to keep the average resource consumption low while maintaining satisfactory video quality.  5 Refs.

Title: Scratch detection and removal from static images using simple  statistics and genetic algorithms
Abstract: This paper investigates the removal of line scratches from old movies and gives a twofold contribution.  First, it presents sample  technique for detecting the scratches, based on an analysis of the  statistics of the grey levels.  Second, the scratches removal is  approached as an optimisation problem, and it is solved by using a  genetic algorithm.  The method can be classified as a static  approach, as it works independently on each single frame of the  sequence.  It does not require any a-priori knowledge of the absolute position of the scratch, nor an external starting population of  chromosomes for genetic algorithm.  The central column of the line  scratch once detected is changed with a conventional linear  interpolation; this transformation is the starting point of the  optimisation process.  12 Refs.

Title: Image restoration using an hybrid approach based on DWT and SMKF
Abstract: Various approaches based on Kalman filtering exist in the literature  for image restoration.  The reduced order model Kalman filter (ROMKF) has comparable performance with less computational complexity.  For  further reduction in computational complexity, a simplified model  Kalman filter (SMKF) for image restoration is suggested in this  paper.  Furthermore, an hybrid approach based on discrete wavelet  transform (DWT) and SMKF is proposed for image restoration with  better SNRs especially when the observed image signal-to-noise ratio is low.  In the first step, the approach uses the DWT with few  resolution levels and a moderate threshold value for denoising the  image.  The denoised image will provide a better data to SMKF in the  second step.  The proposed approach is implemented on a visual image  to evaluate its performance in comparison with the SMKF and DWT  approaches.  7 Refs.

Title: Rate allocation criteria in source-channel coding of images
Abstract: In progressive joint source-channel coding of images, experiments  show that optimizing rate allocation according to PSNR criteria and  according to rate criteria produce essentially similar results - a  very important observation because optimization by rate is often  much easier.  This paper presents analysis to uncover the reason for  - and the generality of - these empirical results.  We first examine  the typical shape of the distribution of PSNR in light of the  distribution of the first uncorrectable error in the bit-stream.   Then we analyze the sensitivity of rate allocation to the  operational R-D curve, via parametric modeling of the source and the channel.  We demonstrate that rate allocation is locally insensitive  to variations in the R-D characteristics.  This analysis provides a  justification for low-complexity rate allocation algorithms, such as the one by Chande and Farvardin, that work independently of the  operational R-D curve.  7 Refs.

Title: Effective line detection with error propagation
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new Hough Transform aimed at improving  curve detection accuracy and robustness as well as computational  efficiency.  Robustness and accuracy improvement is achieved by  analytically propagating the errors with image pixels to the  estimated curve parameters.  The errors with the curve parameters are then used to determine the contribution of pixels to the accumulator array.  The computational efficiency is achieved by choosing  best-distinguished pixels and by performing progressive detection.   The detection approaches were given for line and circle.  The concept can be applied to other curves, such as circle and ellipse.  The  experiments on line detection show improved performance with our  technique.  13 Refs.

Title: One-class SVM for learning in image retrieval
Abstract: Relevance feedback schemes using linear/quadratic estimators have  been applied in content-based image retrieval to significantly  improve retrieval performance.  One major difficulty in relevance  feedback is to estimate the support of target images in high  dimensional feature space with a relatively small number of training samples.  In this paper, we develop a novel scheme based on one-class SVM, which fits a tight hyper-sphere in the nonlinearly transformed  feature space to include most of the target images based on the  positive examples.  The use of kernel provides us an elegant way to  deal with nonlinearity in the distribution of the target images,  while the regularization term in SVM provides good generalization  ability.  To validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, we test  it on both synthesized data and real-world images.  Promising results are achieved in both cases.  15 Refs.

Title: The curvelet transform for image denoising
Abstract: We present approximate digital implementations of two new  mathematical transforms, namely, the ridgelet transform and the  curvelet transform.  Our implementations offer exact reconstruction,  stability against perturbations, ease of implementation, and low  computational complexity.  We apply these digital transforms to the  denoising of some standard images embedded in white noise.  In the  tests reported here, simple thresholding of the curvelet  coefficients is very competitive with 'state of the art' techniques  based on wavelets, including thresholding of decimated or  undecimated wavelet transforms and also including tree-based  Bayesian posterior mean methods.  Moreover, the curvelet  reconstructions exhibit higher perceptual quality than wavelet-based reconstructions, offering visually sharper images and, in  particular, higher quality recovery of edges and of faint linear and curvilinear features.

Title: An algebraic construction of codes for Slepian-Wolf source networks
Abstract: This correspondence proposes an explicit construction of fixed-length codes for Slepian-Wolf (SW) source networks.  The proposed code is  linear, and has two-step encoding and decoding procedures similar to the concatenated code used for channel coding.  Encoding and decoding of the code can be done in a polynomial order of the block length.   The proposed code can achieve arbitrary small probability of error  for ergodic sources with finite alphabets, if the pair of encoding  rates is in the achievable region.  Further, if the sources are  memoryless, the proposed code can be modified to become universal  and the probability of error vanishes exponentially as the block  length tends to infinity.  13 Refs.

Title: The next release problem
Abstract: Companies developing and maintaining complex software systems need to determine the features that should be added to their system as part  of the next release.  They will wish to select these features to  ensure the demands of their client base are satisfied as much as  possible while at the same time ensuring that they themselves have  the resources to undertake the necessary development.  This situation is modelled in this paper and the problem of selecting an optimal  next release is shown to be NP-hard.  The use of various modern  heuristics to find a high quality but possibly suboptimal solution  is described.  Comparative studies of these heuristics are given for  various test cases. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights  reserved.  11 Refs.

Title: On the parameterization of positive real sequences and MA parameter  estimation
Abstract: An algorithm for moving average (MA) parameter estimation was  recently proposed by Stoica et al.  Its key step (covariance fitting) is a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem with two convex  constraints: one reflecting the real positiveness of the desired  covariance sequence and the other having a second-order cone form.   In this paper, we analyze two parameterizations of a positive real  sequence and show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between  them.  We also show that the dual of the covariance fitting problem  has a significantly smaller number of variables and, thus, a much  reduced computational complexity.  We discuss in detail the  formulations that are best suited for the currently available  semidefinite quadratic programming packages.  Experimental results  show that the execution times of the newly proposed algorithms scale well with the MA order, which are therefore convenient for  large-order MA signals.  22 Refs.

Title: Optimum equalization of multicarrier systems: A unified geometric  approach
Abstract: This paper presents a new iterative equalization algorithm that  maximizes capacity for discrete multitone (DMT) systems.  The  research modifies a previously proposed criterion and applies an  appropriate transformation to map the objective function and the  constraint set into a canonical region.  The resulting constraint set exhibits an identifiable geometric characteristic.  Using the  gradient projection method in conjunction with projection onto  convex sets (POCS) provides us with an iterative search algorithm  that facilitates the gradient descent method.  We also generalize the approach to two important subclasses of equalizers, namely linear  phase and unit tap filters.  We also derive a fundamental limit on  the performance of the proposed approach.  In comparison with the  previous methods, the proposed equalization algorithm is less  computationally complex and more geometrically intuitive.  Simulation experiments confirm the validity of the proposed method for  equalization of DMT systems.  16 Refs.

Title: Perception-guided global illumination solution for animation  rendering
Abstract: We present a method for efficient global illumination computation in  dynamic environments by taking advantage of temporal coherence of  lighting distribution.  The method is embedded in the framework of  stochastic photon tracing and density estimation techniques.  A  locally operating energy-based error metric is used to prevent  photon processing in the temporal domain for the scene regions in  which lighting distribution changes rapidly.  A perception-based  error metric suitable for animation is used to keep noise inherent  in stochastic methods below the sensitivity level of the human  observer.  As a result a perceptually-consistent quality across all  animation frames is obtained.  Furthermore, the computation cost is  reduced compared to the traditional approaches operating solely in  the spatial domain.  31 Refs.

Title: Early termination algorithm for transient stability analysis
Abstract: Breakthroughs on nonlinear stability theory are needed in order to  estimate the stability beyond the observation period and terminate  the simulation as early as possible.  Based on EEAC stability theory, an algorithm for early terminating time domain simulation is  introduced in this paper.  Ensuring that all multi-swing unstable  cases can be reliably identified, the algorithm largely decreases  the computational burden for stability analyses.  If the stability  margin is large enough, and if the incoherencies within both  critical cluster and remaining cluster are not strong, the system  won't lose stability after a short observation period.  Accordingly,  not only indexes for evaluating incoherency within a cluster of  trajectories, but also two criteria for identifying false  dynamic-saddle-point and false farthest-end-point are developed.   Simulations and 3 years' engineering applications at home and abroad have fully confirmed the reliability and effectiveness of this  algorithm.  3 Refs.

Title: A theory of tie-set graph and its application to information network  management
Abstract: This paper presents a new circuit theoretical concept based on the  principal partition theorem for distributed network management  focusing on loops of an information network.  To realize a simple  network management with the minimum number of local agents, namely  the topological degrees of freedom of a graph, a reduced loop agent  graph generated by contracting the minimal principal minor is  proposed.  To investigate the optimal distribution of the loop  agents, a theory of tie-set graph is proposed.  Considering the total processing load of loop agents, a complexity of a tie-set graph is  introduced to obtain the simplest tie-set graph with the minimum  complexity.  As for the simplest tie-set graph search, an  experimental result shows that the computational time depends  heavily on the nullity of the original graph.  Therefore, a tie-set  graph with the smallest nullity is essential for network management.  11 Refs.

Title: Resolution for skeptical stable model semantics
Abstract: An extension of resolution for skeptical stable model semantics is  introduced.  Unlike previous approaches, our calculus is not derived  from credulous inference and enjoys a number of properties that are  not satisfied by current nonmonotonic reasoning systems.  Skeptical  resolution is top down, in general, and goal directed on  call-consistent programs.  It does not need the given program to be  instantiated before reasoning.  It may compute nonground answer  substitutions efficiently.  It is compatible with different  implementations of negation as failure.  Some inferences, which  depend on nonground negative goals, can be drawn without resorting  to negation-as-failure; as a consequence, many goals that flounder  in the standard setting have a successful skeptical derivation.  The  paper contains a preliminary study of some interesting derivation  strategies and a sketch of a prototype implementation of the  calculus.  23 Refs.

Title: Researches on the topological invariable Fibonacci sequence of the  periodic buds in the general Mandelbrot sets
Abstract: The inner structure of the general Mandelbrot sets generated by the  complex map z is implied by z**1 + c (alpha less than 0) was  studied.  A series of families of chaos-fractal images were generated by using the escape time algorithm.  The escaping area was embedded  in stable area by making many computational mathematic experiments.   Periodic numbers of stable area and the numbers and position of the  periodic buds were got by solving algebraic equations.  This presents a better understanding on the structure of the Mandelbrot sets.   Furthermore, the topological invariance on the Fibonacci sequence of the periodic buds was discovered.  The Fibonacci sequence is another  way to the chaos except three commonly accepted ways to the chaos.   The Fibonacci sequence can be used in the encryption, compression  and storage of data.  9 Refs.

Title: Fast 2D discrete cosine transform on compressed image in restricted  quadtree and shading format
Abstract: Given a compressed image in the restricted quadtree and shading  format, this paper presents a fast algorithm for computing 2D  discrete cosine transform (DCT) on the compressed grey image  directly without the need to decompress the compressed image.  The  proposed new DCT algorithm takes O(K**2logK+ N**2) time where the  decompressed image is of size N multiplied by N and K denotes the  number of nodes in the restricted quadtree.  Since commonly K less  than N, the proposed algorithm is faster than the indirect method by decompressing the compressed image first, then applying the  conventional DCT algorithm on the decompressed image.  The indirect  method takes O(N**2logN) time. copy 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.  All  rights reserved.  14 Refs.

Title: Incremental fourier interpolation of 2-D fractional Brownian motion
Abstract: This paper presents a new method to interpolate two-dimensional  fractional Brownian motion (fBm). fBm interpolation can be used in  multimedia applications such as landscape synthesis or zooming into  a synthetic scene, where the objective is to generate an fBm field  that passes through a sparse set of known points. fBm interpolation  problem differs from standard image interpolation because noise must be added to the interpolated points to obtain an interpolated image  with the proper second-order statistics.  Our interpolation method is based on the first-order increments of both the original fBm and  interpolated fBm.  These increments are stationary and yield  interpolation equations with a Toeplitz-block-Toeplitz structure  which can be approximated by a circulant-block-circulant matrix.  By  taking advantage of fast Fourier transform, the computational  complexity is O(N**2 log//2 N) for N multiplied by N image  interpolation.  Simulation shows this method achieves good  second-order statistics, even for small-size images.  14 Refs.

Title: Towards a standard schema for C/C++
Abstract: Developing a standard schema at the abstract syntax tree level for  C/C++ to be used by reverse engineering and reengineering tools is a complex and difficult problem.  In this paper, we present a catalogue of issues that need to be considered iii order to design a solution.  Three categories of issues are discussed.  Lexical structure is the  first category and pertains to characteristics of the source code,  such as spaces and comments.  The second category, syntax, includes  both the mundane and hard problems in the C++ programming language.   The final category is semantics and covers aspects such as naming  and reference resolution.  Example solutions to these challenges are  provided from the Datrix schema from Bell Canada and the Columbus  schema from University of Szeged.  The paper concludes with a  discussion of lessons learnt and plans for future work on a C/C++  AST standard schema.  23 Refs.

Abstract: A method for the design of a Lossless Discrete Integrator (LDI)  digital filter with low complexity Finite Precision Coefficients  (FPC) based on a discrete constrained optimization formulation and  Constrained Simulated Annealing (CSA) is presented.  Simple  quantization of floating point precision coefficients and other  unconstrained optimization methods cannot precisely control the  number of required coefficient adders and subtractors.  It is shown  that it is possible to control the coefficient complexity (the  number of coefficient adders and subtractors) while still meeting  the passband tipple specifications and achieving a small stopband  tipple.  Extremely low coefficient complexity filters can be achieved at the expense of a larger stopband ripple.  11 Refs.

Title: Frequency domain equalization for high data rate multipath channels
Abstract: High data rate transmission over multipath channels requires  equalizers of long impulse response.  In such cases, frequency domain implementation of the block least mean square (BLMS) algorithm  offers low complexity growth relative to time domain techniques.  The work presented herein is devoted to a study of the fast BLMS (FBLMS) algorithm implemented in the frequency domain using overlap-save  sectioning and the fast Fourier transform (FFT).  We examine the bit  error rate (BER) performance for high data rate quadrature phase  shift keying (QPSK) transmission over a multipath channel as well as the computational complexity of the FBLMS equalizer in comparison to the time domain implementation.  Finally, we show how normalizing the step size of the FBLMS algorithm according to the power distribution of the input process results in a significant improvement in the  equalizer convergence relative to the time domain methods.  6 Refs.

Title: ROM size reduction with low processing cost for Direct Digital  Frequency Synthesis
Abstract: A novel sine amplitude compression technique is presented for  application in low-power Direct Digital Frequency Synthesizers.  It  is based on a systematic approach aimed at exploiting as much  redundancy as possible between the value of a phase angle and its  sine amplitude.  It is shown that a compression ratio of  approximately 19.3 is attained, saving four bits of storage per  word.  The new technique compares favorably with previous designs in  that better storage reduction is accomplished at low processing  cost.  The technique can be used in conjunction with traditional  approaches for even greater area and power reduction.  A new Direct  Digital Frequency Synthesizer architecture based on the technique is presented.  10 Refs.

Title: Distributed MST for constant diameter graphs
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of distributively constructing a  minimum-weight spanning tree (MST) for graphs of constant diameter  in the bounded-messages model, where each message can contain at  most B bits for some parameter B. It is shown that the time required to compute an MST for graphs of diameter 4 or 3 can be as high as  Omega(3 root n/B) and Omega(4 root n/2 root B), respectively.  The  lower bound holds even if the algorithm is allowed to be randomized.  On the other hand, it is shown that O(log n) time units suffice to  compute an MST deterministically for graphs with diameter 2, when B  = O(log n).  These results complement a previously known lower bound  of Omega(2 root n/B) for graphs of diameter Omega(log n).  11 Refs.

Title: Adaptive multichannel equalization utilizing multiple antennas for a  WPMA system over frequency selective slowly fading channels
Abstract: A wavelet packet function based multiple access (WPMA) system was  developed to maximize information throughput and improve receiver  performance.  However, over frequency selective slowly fading  channels, the conventional correlation receiver results in poor  performance.  To design an efficient receiver that mitigates residual multiple access interference (MAI) and intersymbol interference,  while improving received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) simultaneously  on the uplink, a multichannel decision feedback equalizer (DFE)  using the space diversity combining (SDC) is proposed in this paper.  Since the wavelet packet functions are bandlimited in the frequency  domain, the computational complexity of the proposed receiver does  not increase as the number of active user increases.  Theoretical  analysis and simulation results show that, the developed equalizer  behaves quite well and outperforms the single channel DPE and the  multichannel DFE without SDC greatly.  8 Refs.

Title: Possibilities and limitations of call-by-need space improvement
Abstract: Innocent-looking program transformations can easily change the space  complexity of lazy functional programs.  The theory of space  improvement seeks to characterise those local program  transformations which are guaranteed never to worsen asymptotic  space complexity of any program.  Previous work by the authors  introduced the space improvement relation and showed that a number  of simple local transformation laws are indeed space improvements.   This paper seeks an answer to the following questions: is the  improvement relation inhabited by interesting program  transformations, and, if so, how might they be established? We show  that the asymptotic space improvement relation is semantically badly behaved, but that the theory of strong space improvement possesses a fixed-point induction theorem which permits the derivation of  improvement properties for recursive definitions.  With the help of  this tool we explore the landscape of space improvement by  considering a range of classical program transformations.  32 Refs.

Title: Cost recurrences for DML programs
Abstract: A cost recurrence describes an upper bound for the running time of a  program in terms of the size of its input.  Finding cost recurrences  is a frequent intermediate step in complexity analysis, and this  step requires an abstraction from data to data size.  In this  article, we use information contained in dependent types to achieve  such an abstraction: Dependent ML (DML), a conservative extension of ML, provides dependent types that can be used to associate data with size information, thus describing a possible abstraction.  We  automatically extract cost recurrences from first-order DML  programs, guiding the abstraction from data to data size with  information contained in DML type derivations.  15 Refs.

Title: Fast computation of linear generators for matrix sequences and  application to the block Wiedemann algorithm
Abstract: In this paper we describe how the half-gcd algorithm can be adapted  in order to speed up the sequential stage of Copper-Smith's block  Wiedemann algorithm for solving large sparse linear systems over any finite field.  This very stage solves a sub-problem than can be seen  as the computation of a linear generator for a matrix sequence.  Our  primary realm of interest is the field F//q for large prime power q. For the solution of a N multiplied by N system, the complexity of  this sequential part drops from O(N**2) to O(M(N) log N) where M(d)  is the cost for multiplying two polynomials of degree d. We discuss  the implications of this improvement for the overall cost of the  block Wiedemann algorithm and how its parameters should be chosen  for best efficiency.  26 Refs.

Title: New complexity bounds for cylindrical decompositions of sub-Pfaffian  sets
Abstract: Tarski-Seidenberg principle plays a key role in many applications and algorithms of computer algebra.  Moreover it is constructive, and  some very efficient quantifier elimination algorithms appeared  recently.  However, Tarski-Seidenberg principle is wrong for  first-order theories involving some real analytic functions (e.g. an exponential function).  In this case a weaker statement is sometimes  true, a possibility to eliminate one sort of quantifiers (either for all or there exists ). We construct a new algorithm for a  cylindrical cell decomposition of a closed cube I**n is contained in R**n compatible with a semianalytic subset S is contained in I**n,  defined by Pfaffian functions.  In particular the algorithm is able  to eliminate one sort of quantifiers from a first-order formula.  The complexity bound of the algorithm is doubly exponential in n**2.  19  Refs.

Title: A linear space algorithm for computing the Hermite Normal Form
Abstract: Computing the Hermite Normal Form of an n multiplied by n integer  matrix using the best current algorithms typically requires  O(n**3log M) space, where M is a bound on the entires of the input  matrix.  Although polynomial in the input size (which is O(n**2log  M)), this space blow-up can easily become a serious issue in  practice when working on big integer matrices.  In this paper we  present a new algorithm for computing the Hermite Normal Form which  uses only O(n**2log M) space (i.e., essentially the same as the  input size).  When implemented using standard algorithms for integer  and matrix multiplication, our algorithm has the same time  complexity of the asymptotically fastest (but space inefficient)  algorithms.  We also present a heuristic algorithm for HNF that  achieves a substantial speedup when run on randomly generated input  matrices.  24 Refs.

Title: Computing all factorizations in Z//N// [//x// right  bracket
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for determining all factorizations of a  polynomial f in the domain Z//n// [//x//] , a non-unique factorization domain, given in terms of parameters.   From the prime factorization of N, the problem is reduced to  factorization in Z//p//k// [//x//] where p  is a prime and k greater than or equivalent 1. If p**k does not  divide the discriminant of f and one factorization is given, our  algorithm determines all factorizations with complexity O(n**3M(k  log p)) where n denotes the degree of the input polynomial and M(t)  denotes the complexity of multiplication of two t-bit numbers.  Our  algorithm improves on the method of von zur Gathen and Hartlieb,  which has complexity O(n**7k(k log p + log n)**2).  The improvement  is achieved by processing all factors at the same time instead of  one of a time and by computing the kernels and determinants of  matrices over Z//p//k in an efficient manner.  11 Refs.

Title: The self-consistent parametric inference algorithm (SPI):  Optimisation in continuous search space
Abstract: The self-consistent parametric inference algorithm represents a  dynamical optimisation procedure in continuous search space based on a parametrised approach and supposed to solve procedural tasks in  operations research.  Continuous parametric descriptions and  estimation by inference are extended to a functional  self-consistency approach, which in the present work we discuss in  the context of typical problems for flexible manufacturing systems.   We focus on the question, once the problem is formally parametrised, whether the hypothesis yields a reasonable solution in a continuous  search space.  The constrained search space profile becomes visible  through an analytical approximate solution and can be analysed in  the spirit of meta-heuristics.  Additionally, a quality measure for  the solution is given, which extends the solving algorithm to a  learning procedure yielding a guide for the progressive production  of an adequate solution to the given optimisation problem. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Scalability tests of these algorithms on massively  parallel computers show that the linear-scaling DFT algorithm is  highly scalable.

Title: Scalable color image indexing and retrieval using vector wavelets
Abstract: This paper presents a scalable content-based image indexing and  retrieval system based on vector wavelet coefficients of color  images.  Highly decorrelated wavelet coefficient planes are used to  acquire a search efficient feature space.  The feature space is  subsequently indexed using properties of all the images in the  database.  Therefore, the feature key of an image not only  corresponds to the content of the image itself but also to how much  the image is different from the other images being stored in the  database.  The search time linearly depends on the number of images  similar to the query image and is independent of the database size.   We show that, in a database of 5,000 images, query search takes less than 30 msec on a 266 MHz Pentium II processor, compared to several  seconds of retrieval time in the earlier systems proposed in the  literature.  24 Refs.

The discrete solutions obtained by the above  mentioned methods are being compared with the exact solutions and  also the discrete solutions using Laplace Transform and extended  Runge Kutta method based on Arithmetic Mean (RKAM - classical RK  method).  The absolute error between the exact solutions and the  discrete solutions have been determined and represented in tabular  and graphical forms.  By observing the error tables and graphs, the  discrete solutions determined by the newly introduced methods are  found to be more closer to the exact solutions.  14 Refs.

Title: Chord: A scalable peer-to-peer lookup service for internet  applications
Abstract: A fundamental problem that confronts peer-to-peer applications is to  efficiently locate the node that stores a particular data item.  This paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses  this problem.  Chord provides support for just one operation: given a key, it maps the key onto a node.  Data location can be easily  implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data  item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the  key maps.  Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the  system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously  changing.  Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and  experiments show that Chord is scalable, with communication cost and the state maintained by each node scaling logarithmically with the  number of Chord nodes.  22 Refs.

Title: Analysis and design of an Adaptive Virtual Queue (AVQ) algorithm for  active Queue management
Abstract: Virtual Queue-based marking schemes have been recently for AQM  (Active Queue Management) in Internet routers.  We consider a  particular scheme, which we call the Adaptive Virtual Queue (AVQ),  and study its following properties: stability in the presence of  feedback delays, its ability to maintain small queue lengths and its robustness in the presence of extremely short flows (the so-called  web mice).  Using a mathematical tool motivated by the earlier work  of Hollot et al, we present a simple rule to design the parameters  of the AVQ algorithm.  We then compare its performance through  simulation with several well-known AQM schemes such as RED, REM, PI  controller and a non-adaptive virtual queue algorithm.  With a view  towards implementation, we show that AVQ can be implemented as a  simple token bucket using only a few lines of code.  16 Refs.

Title: New edge-directed interpolation
Abstract: This paper proposes an edge-directed interpolation algorithm for  natural images.  The basic idea is to first estimate local covariance coefficients from a low-resolution image and then use these  covariance estimates to adapt the interpolation at a higher  resolution based on the geometric duality between the low-resolution covariance and the high-resolution covariance.  The edge-directed  property of covariance-based adaptation attributes to its capability of tuning the interpolation coefficients to match an arbitrarily  oriented step edge.  A hybrid approach of switching between bilinear  interpolation and covariance-based adaptive interpolation is  proposed to reduce the overall computational complexity.  Two  important applications of the new interpolation algorithm are  studied: resolution enhancement of grayscale images and  reconstruction of color images from CCD samples.  Simulation results  demonstrate that our new interpolation algorithm substantially  improves the subjective quality of the interpolated images over  conventional linear interpolation.  23 Refs.

Title: Nonlinear group-blind multiuser detection
Abstract: A nonlinear group-blind technique is developed for joint detection of the some given users' data in a CDMA uplink environment with the  presence of unknown interference.  This method performs the so-called "slowest-descent search" over a likelihood function of the desired  users, starting from the estimate closest to the unconstrained  maximizer of the likelihood function, and along mutually orthogonal  directions where this likelihood function drops the slowest.   Simulation results show that this new nonlinear technique offers  substantial performance improvement over the recently proposed  linear group-blind multiuser detectors with little attendant  increase in computational complexity.  The problem of group-blind  multiuser detection in the presence of both unknown interference and impulsive ambient noise is also treated under the framework of  slowest-descent search, with the aid of a novel subspace-based  robust interference cancellation scheme.  It is seen that this robust group-blind method significantly outperforms the robust blind  multiuser detection scheme proposed recently.  36 Refs.

Title: A new spatio-temporal equalization method based on estimated channel  response
Abstract: This paper process a new spatio-temporal equalization method, which  simultaneously utilizes an adaptive antenna array and a decision  feedback equalizer (DFE).  For effective spatio-temporal equalization with less computational cost, how to split equalization  functionality into spatial processing, and temporal processing is  quite important.  One of the answers which we have given is "incoming signals with larger time delays should be cancelled at the spatial  equalization part." The weights of both adaptive antenna array  elements and taps of DFE are calculated only using estimated channel impulse response, therefore, it requires no information on direction of arrival (DoA).  We show the performance of the proposed system in  multipath fading channels often encountered in indoor wireless  environments and discuss the attainable bit error rate (BER),  antenna patterns, and the computational complexity in comparison  with other equalization methods such as spatial equalization and  temporal equalization.  16 Refs.

Title: A simple strategy for calibrating the geometry of light sources
Abstract: We present a methodology for calibrating multiple light source  locations in 3D from images.  The procedure involves the use of a  novel calibration object that consists of three spheres at known  relative positions.  The process uses intensity images to find the  positions of the light sources.  We conducted experiments to locate  light sources in 51 different positions in a laboratory setting.  Our data shows that the vector from a point in the scene to a light  source can be measured to within 2.7 plus or minus 4 degree at alpha = .05 (6 percent relative) of its true direction and within 0.13  plus or minus 02 m at alpha = .05 (9 percent relative) of its true  magnitude compared to empirically measured ground truth.  Finally, we demonstrate how light source information is used for color  correction.  21 Refs.

Title: A high-speed multi-port data buffer design for low-energy DSP  applications
Abstract: Area and power of data storage elements can be excessively large in  many data intensive DSP ASICs, such as high-throughput pipelined  FFTs and data interleavers.  In this paper, we present a  low-complexity multi-port data buffer design methodology based on  dynamic memory configuration that results in small area and low  power overhead by adapting the buffer architecture to their data  access requirements.  The buffer minimizes the number of transistors  and simplifies the interface between memory core and external  digital circuitry.  The buffer can be designed with a low cost  digital circuit processing technology.  To evaluate our methodology,  we designed buffer for data interleaver and pipelined FFT that  require high throughput.  We compare the buffer with conventional  buffers based on static memory.  6 Refs.

Title: An efficient digit-serial systolic multiplier for finite fields  GF(2**m)
Abstract: In this paper, an efficient digit-serial systolic array is proposed  for multiplication in finite fields GF(2**m) with the standard basis representation.  From the least significant bit first algorithm, we  obtain a new dependence graph and design an efficient digit-serial  systolic multiplier.  If input data comes in continuously, the  proposed array can produce multiplication results at a rate of one  every [m/L] clock cycles, where L is the  selected digit size.  The analysis results show that the proposed  architecture leads to a considerable reduction of computational  delay time with a moderate increase of hardware complexity, compared to the existing digit-serial systolic multipliers.  Furthermore,  since the new architecture has the features of regularity,  modularity, and unidirectional data flow, it is well suited to VLSI  implementation with fault-tolerant design.  13 Refs.

Title: A clustering utility based approach for ASIC design
Abstract: Due to the rapid growth of technologies, Systems-on-Chip (SoC) have  started to become a key issue in today's electronic industry.  In  deep sub-micron designs, the interconnect is responsible for more  than 90 percent of the signal delay in a chip.  This paper presents a new approach for dealing with the high complexity of ASIC design.  A  new hierarchal clustering heuristic is presented that demonstrates  excellent characteristics for reducing the execution time of  standard-cell placement while achieving better results compared to  non-clustered circuit placement methods.  The clustering algorithm  reduced the wire-length by 2% for small circuits and upto 10% for  large circuits.  Total Execution time was reduced by more than 70% as expected.  6 Refs.

Title: Numeration systems on a regular language: Arithmetic operations,  recognizability and formal power series
Abstract: Generalizations of numeration systems in which N is recognizable by a finite automaton are obtained by describing a lexicographically  ordered infinite regular language L is contained in Sigma*.  For  these systems, we obtain a characterization of recognizable sets of  integers in terms of N-rational formal series.  After a study of the  polynomial regular languages, we show that, if the complexity of L  is Theta(n**l) (resp. if L is the complement of a polynomial  language), then multiplication by lambda is a member of the set of N preserves recognizability only if lambda=beta**l**+**1 (resp. if  lambda does not equal (#Sigma)**beta) for some beta is a member of  the set of N. Finally, we obtain sufficient conditions for the  notions of recognizability for abstract systems and some positional  number systems to be equivalent. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Towards a practical snapshot algorithm
Abstract: An atomic snapshot memory is an implementation of a multiple-location shared memory that can be atomically read in its entirety without  preventing concurrent writing.  The design of wait-free  implementations of atomic snapshot memories has been the subject of  extensive theoretical research in recent years.  This paper  introduces the coordinated-collect algorithm, a novel wait-free  atomic snapshot construction which we believe is a first step in  taking snapshots from theory to practice.  Unlike previous  algorithms, it uses currently available multiprocessor  synchronization operations to provide an algorithm that has only  O(1) update complexity and O(n) scan complexity, with very small  constants.  We evaluated the performance of known snapshot algorithms for a collection of benchmarks on a simulated distributed  shared-memory multiprocessor.  Our empirical evidence suggests that  coordinated-collect will outperform all known wait-free, lock-free,  and locking snapshot algorithms in terms of overall throughput and  latency. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: A framework for efficient data redistribution on distributed memory  multicomputers
Abstract: Array redistribution is required often in programs on distributed  memory parallel computers.  It is essential to use efficient  algorithms for redistribution; otherwise the performance of the  programs will degrade considerably.  The redistribution overheads  consist of two parts: computation and inter-processor communication.  In this paper, by using a notation for the local data description  called an LDD, we propose a framework to optimize the array  redistribution algorithm both in index computation and  inter-processor communication.  That is, our work makes an effort to  optimize not only the computation cost but also communication cost  for array redistribution algorithms.  We present an efficient index  computation method and generate a schedule that minimizes the number of communication steps and eliminates node contention in each  communication step.  Some experiments show the efficiency and  flexibility of our techniques.  29 Refs.

Title: A compressed domain beat detector using MP3 audio bitstreams
Abstract: This paper presents a novel beat detector that processes MPEG-1 Layer III (known as MP3) encoded audio bitstreams directly in the  compressed domain.  Most previous beat detection or tracking systems  dealing with MIDI or PCM signals are not directly applicable to  compressed audio bitstreams, such as MP3 bitstreams.  We have  developed the beat detector as part of a beat-pattern based error  concealment scheme for streaming music over error prone channels.   Special effort was used to obtain a tailored trade-off between  performance, complexity and memory consumption for this specific  application.  A comparison between the machine-detected results to  the human annotation has shown that the proposed method correctly  tracked beats in 4 out of 6 popular music test signals.  The results  were analyzed.  17 Refs.

Title: An object-oriented metrics suite for Ada 95
Abstract: Ada 95 added object-oriented programming capabilities of the existing Ada standard.  The object-oriented paradigm results in new  relationships within and among software modules.  Traditional  software product metrics, i.e., those metrics developed for  functionally oriented software, do not account for these new  relationships and may be insufficient for use in object-oriented  development.  This paper addresses this deficiency by 1) defining a  set of object-oriented metrics tailored to Ada 95 software, and 2)  providing empirical evidence of their validity.  This set of metrics  includes product measures quantifying the class-related software  attributes of size, coupling, cohesion, and complexity.  The results  indicate that many of the metrics examined do correlate to the  number of revisions made to the classes during development.  20 Refs.

Title: Wavelet-Galerkin method for solving parabolic equations in finite  domains
Abstract: A novel wavelet-Galerkin method tailored to solve parabolic equations in finite domains is presented.  The emphasis of the paper is on the  development of the discretization formulations that are specific to  finite domain parabolic equations with arbitrary boundary conditions based on weak form functionals.  The proposed method also deals with  the development of algorithms for computing the associated  connection coefficients at arbitrary points.  Here the Lagrange  multiplier method is used to enforce the essential boundary  conditions.  The numerical results on a two-dimensional transient  heat conducting problem are used to validate the proposed  wavelet-Galerkin algorithm as an effective numerical method to solve finite domain parabolic equations. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Unitary operators for Fast Latent Semantic Indexing (FLSI)
Abstract: Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) dramatically reduces the dimension of  the document space by mapping it into a space spanned by conceptual  indices.  Empirically, the number of concepts that can represent the  documents are far fewer than the great variety of words in the  textual representation.  Although this almost obviates the problem of lexical matching, the mapping incurs a high computational cost  compared to document parsing, indexing, query matching, and  updating.  This paper shows how LSI is based on a unitary  transformation, for which there are computationally more attractive  alternatives.  This is exemplified by the Haar transform, which is  memory efficient, and can be computed in linear to sublinear time.   The principle advantages of LSI are thus preserved while the  computational costs are drastically reduced.  6 Refs.

Title: Efficient instruction-level optimization methodology for low-power  embedded systems
Abstract: In this paper, for low-power embedded systems, we solve the  instruction scheduling and reordering problem as a Precedence  Constrained Hamiltonian Path Problem for DAGs and the Traveling  Salesman Problem (TSP), both of which are NP-Hard.  We propose an  efficient instruction-level optimization algorithm for solving the  NP-Hard problem.  Minimum spanning tree (MST) and simulated annealing (SA) mechanisms are used for the optimization.  We describe the  methods for generating the control flow and data dependence graph  (CDG), power dissipation table (PDT), and weighted strongly  connected graph (SCG) for the instruction-level low-power analysis.   In addition, confidence limits with error tolerance are considered  for the validation of the optimization.  Finally, experimental  results that demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms are shown.  15 Refs.

The broader class of Group Support  System (GSS) technologies, that include highly successful products  such as Lotus Notes and NetMeeting, has fared substantially better.   This case study is of one large company that has been relatively  successful in diffusing Lotus Notes and NetMeeting, while only  slowly winning an uphill battle implementing GroupSystems, a popular EMS.  25 Refs.

Title: System-level test synthesis for mixed-signal designs
Abstract: Hierarchical test approaches are a must for large designs due to the  computational complexity and tight time-to-market requirements.  In  hierarchical test synthesis, test design is conducted at a subsystem level where the design complexity is manageable.  For analog systems, tests are generally designed at the basic block level.  This paper  outlines a tool for translating basic block-level tests into  system-level tests for large analog systems.  Computational  effectiveness is achieved by the use of high level models and by a  pre-analysis of the system to identify feasible translation paths.  A method to compute the fault and yield coverages of the resultant  system-level tests is also provided in order to evaluate the  translation.  Experimental results show that test translation reduces design for testability overhead significantly while satisfying  coverage requirements.  17 Refs.

Title: Parallel hybrid method for SAT that couples genetic algorithms and  local search
Abstract: A parallel hybrid method for solving the satisfiability (SAT) problem that combines cellular genetic algorithms (GAs) and the random walk  SAT (WSAT) strategy of greedy SAT (GSAT) is presented.  The method,  called cellular genetic WSAT (CGWSAT), uses a cellular GA to perform a global search from a random initial population of candidate  solutions and a local selective generation of new strings.  Global  search is then specialized in local search by adopting the WSAT  strategy.  A main characteristic of the method is that it indirectly  provides a parallel implementation of WSAT when the probability of  crossover is set to zero.  CGWSAT has been implemented on a Meiko  CS-2 parallel machine using a two-dimensional cellular automaton as  a parallel computation model.  The algorithm has been tested on  randomly generated problems and some classes of problems from the  DIMACS and SATLIB test set.  38 Refs.

Title: Nice point sets can have nasty delaunay triangulations
Abstract: We consider the complexity of Delaunay triangulations of sets of  points in IR**3 under certain practical geometric constraints.  The  spread of a set of points is the ratio between the longest and  shortest pairwise distances.  We show that in the worst case, the  Delaunay triangulation of n points in IR**3 with spread Delta has  complexity Omega(min left brace Delta**3,n Delta,n**2 right brace )  and O(min left brace Delta**4, n**2 right brace ). For the case  Delta = ( root n), our lower bound construction consists of a  uniform sample of a smooth convex surface with bounded curvature.  We also construct a family of smooth connected surfaces such that the  Delaunay triangulation of any good point sample has near-quadratic  complexity.  29 Refs.

Abstract: We derive improved bounds on the number of k-dimensional simplices  spanned by a set of n points in R**d that are congruent to a given  k-simplex, for k less than approximately equals d - 1. Let  f//k**(**d**)(n) be the maximum number of k-simplices spanned by a  set of n points in R**d that are congruent to a given k-simplex.  We  prove that f//2**(**3**)(n) = O(n**5**/**3 center dot  2**O**(**alpha**(**2**)**(**n**)**)), f//2**(**4**) (n) =  O(n**2**+**epsilon), f//2**(**5**) (n) = Theta(n**7**/**3), and  f//3**(**4**) (n) = O(n**9**/**4**+**epsilon).  We also derive a  recurrence to bound f//k**(**d**)(n) for arbitrary values of k and  d, and use it to derive the bound f//k**(**d**) (n) =  O(n**d**/**2**+**epsilon for d less than approximately equals 7 and  k less than approximately equals d - 2. Following Erdos and Purdy,  we conjecture that this bound holds for larger values of d as well,  and for k less than approximately equals d - 2. 16 Refs.

Title: The complexity of maximal constraint languages
Abstract: Many combinatorial search problems can be expressed as "constraint  satisfaction problems" using an appropriate "constraint language",  that is, a set of relations over some fixed finite set of values.  It is well-known that there is a trade-off between the expressive power of a constraint language and the complexity of the problems it can  express.  In the present paper we systematically study the complexity of all maximal constraint languages, that is, languages whose  expressive power is just weaker than that of the language of all  constraints.  Using the algebraic invariance properties of  constraints, we exhibit a strong necessary condition for  tractability of such a constraint language.  Moreover, we show that,  at least for small sets of values, this condition is also  sufficient.  29 Refs.

Title: When is the evaluation of conjunctive queries tractable ?
Abstract: The evaluation of conjunctive queries is hard both with respect to  its combined complexity (NP-complete) and its parameterized  complexity (W [1] -complete).  It becomes  tractable (PTIME for combined complexity, FPT for parameterized  complexity), when the underlying graphs of the conjunctive queries  have bounded tree-width.  We show that, in some sense, this is  optimal both with respect to combined and parameterized complexity:  For every class C of graphs, the evaluation of all conjunctive  queries whose underlying graph is in C is tractable if, and only if, C has bounded tree-width.  A technical result of independent interest is that the colored grid homomorphism problem is NP-complete and, if parameterized by the grid size, W [1]  -complete.  16 Refs.

Title: Concurrent and resettable zero-knowledge in poly-logarithmic rounds
Abstract: A proof is concurrent zero-knowledge if it remains zero-knowledge  when many copies of the proof are run in an asynchronous  environment, such as the Internet.  Richardson and Kilian have shown  that there exists a concurrent zero-knowledge proof for any language in NP, but with round complexity polynomial in the maximum number of concurrent proofs.  In this paper, we present a concurrent  zero-knowledge proof for all languages in NP with a poly-logarithmic round complexity: specifically, omega(log**2 k) rounds given at most k concurrent proofs.  Finally, we show that a simple modification of  our proof is a resettable zero-knowledge proof for NP, with  omega(log**2 k) rounds; previously known protocols required a  polynomial number of rounds.  29 Refs.

Title: Private approximation of NP-hard functions
Abstract: The notion of private approximation was introduced recently by  Feigenbaum, Fong, Strauss and Wright.  Informally, a private  approximation of a function f is another function F that  approximates f in the usual sense, but does not yield any  information on x other than what can be deduced from f(x).  As such,  F(x) is useful for private computation of f(x) (assuming that F can  be computed more efficiently than f).  In this work we examine the  properties and limitations of this new notion.  Specifically, we show that for many NP-hard problems, the privacy requirement precludes  non-trivial approximation.  This is the case even for problems that  otherwise admit very good approximation (e.g., problems with PTAS).   On the other hand, we show that slightly relaxing the privacy  requirement, by means of leaking "just a few bits of information"  about x, again permits good approximation.  13 Refs.

Title: A read-once branching program lower bound of omega(2**n**/**4) for  integer multiplication using universal hashing
Abstract: Branching programs (BPs) are a well-established computation and  representation model for Boolean functions.  Especially read-once  branching programs (BP1s) have been studied intensively.  Exponential lower bounds on the BP1 complexity of explicit functions have been  known for a long time.  Nevertheless, the proof of exponential lower  bounds on the read-once branching program size of selected functions is sometimes difficult.  Motivated by the applications the BP1  complexity of fundamental functions is of interest.  It took quite a  long time until Ponzio was able to prove a bound of 2**Omega( root  n) for integer multiplication.  Combining results and methods for  universal hashing with lower bound techniques for BP1s a lower bound of Omega(2**n**/**4) on the size of BP1s for integer multiplication  is presented in this paper.  27 Refs.

Title: The complexity of analytic tableaux
Abstract: The method of analytic tableaux is employed in many introductory  texts and has also been used quite extensively as a basis for  automated theorem proving.  In this paper, we discuss the complexity  of the system as a method for refuting contradictory sets of  clauses, and resolve several open questions.  We discuss the three  forms of analytic tableaux: clausal tableaux, generalized clausal  tableaux, and binary tableaux.  We resolve the relative complexity of these three forms of tableaux proofs and also resolve the relative  complexity of analytic tableaux versus resolution.  We show that  there is a quasi-polynomial simulation of tree resolution by  analytic tableaux; this simulation cannot be improved, since we give a matching lower bound that is tight to within a polynomial.  10  Refs.

Title: A sharp threshold in proof complexity
Abstract: We give the first example of a sharp threshold in proof complexity.   More precisely, we show that for any sufficiently small epsilon  greater than 0 and triangle open greater than 2.28, random formulas  consisting of (1 - epsilon)n 2-clauses and triangle open n  3-clauses, which are known to be unsatisfiable almost certainly,  almost certainly require resolution and Davis-Putnam proofs of  unsatisfiability of exponential size, whereas it is easily seen that random formulas with (1 + epsilon)n 2-clauses (and triangle open n  3-clauses) have linear size proofs of unsatisfiability almost  certainly.  A consequence of our result also yields the first proof  that typical random 3-CNF formulas at ratios below the generally  accepted range of the satisfiability threshold (and thus expected to be satisfiable almost certainly) cause natural Davis-Putnam  algorithms to take exponential time to find satisfying assignments.   32 Refs.

Title: A tight bound for the complexity of Voronoi diagrams under polyhedral convex distance functions in 3D
Abstract: We consider the Voronoi diagram of a set of n points in three  dimensions under a convex distance function induced by an arbitrary, fixed polytope.  The combinatorial complexity, i.e. the number of  vertices, edges, and facets, of this diagram is shown to be in  Theta(n**2), which constitutes a considerable improvement to the  results known so far.  Unlike previous work, we do not need  probabilistic arguments or recurrence techniques, but we exploit  properties of the involved geometric structures.  Key observations  are that the lower envelope of n polygonal chains in the plane with  a total of O(n) line segments and with only a fixed number of slopes is linear in n, and that the number of slopes of Voronoi edges is  bounded by a constant that only depends on the complexity of the  polytope.  25 Refs.

Title: Sampling algorithms: Lower bounds and applications
Abstract: We develop a framework to study probabilistic sampling algorithms  that approximate general functions of the form f: A**n yields B,  where A and B are arbitrary sets.  Our goal is to obtain lower bounds on the query complexity of functions, namely the number of input  variables x//i that any sampling algorithm needs to query to  approximate f(x//1,..., x//n).  We define two quantitative properties of functions - the block sensitivity and the minimum Hellinger  distance - that give us techniques to prove lower bounds on the  query complexity.  These techniques are quite general, easy to use,  yet powerful enough to yield tight results.  Our applications include the mean and higher statistical moments, the median and other  selection functions, and the frequency moments, where we obtain  lower bounds that are close to the corresponding upper bounds.  We  also point out some connections between sampling and streaming  algorithms and lossy compression schemes.  30 Refs.

Title: Consistent floorplanning with super hierarchical constraints
Abstract: Sequence-Pair based floorplanning has been revealed its limit of  usefulness in VLSI physical design.  Among reasons, the key issue is  in its being non-hierarchical and indifferent to the preceding step  of partitioning.  This paper restructure the algorithm by the idea  that the partition algorithm produces the constraint that is imposed on the sequence-pair data.  The partition algorithm is the one based  on the balanced-bipartition that works hierarchically.  Thus a new  floorplan algorithm that is consistent with the hierarchical  partition algorithm is constructed.  This is enhanced to include  other algorithms that are based on the binary search.  Here, a  clock-tree synthesis by H-tree is shown to be consistent.   Experiments are given to show better achievements in length and  wire-density.  11 Refs.

Title: Optimal acyclic fine-grain scheduling with cache effects for embedded and real time systems
Abstract: To sustain the increases in processor performance, embedded and  real-time systems need to find the best total schedule time when  compiling their application.  The optimal acyclic scheduling problem  is a classical challenge which has been formulated using integer  programming in lot of works.  In this paper, we give a new  formulation of acyclic instruction scheduling problem under  registers and resources constraints in multiple instructions issuing processors with cache effects.  Given a direct acyclic graph G = (V,  E), the complexity of our integer linear programming model is  bounded by O( vertical bar V vertical bar **2) variables and O(  vertical bar E vertical bar + vertical bar V vertical bar **2)  constraints.  This complexity is better than the complexity of the  existing techniques which includes a worst total schedule time  factor.  15 Refs.

The procedure for eliminating redundant distance  calculations in VQ included sorting of template vectors in advance  according to the average intensity of vector elements and selection  of the template vectors with average intensity close to that of the  input vector.  It was found that the image quality was maintained  even if the the number of pre-selected templates decreased to about  10% of all templates.  (Edited abstract) 2 Refs.

Title: A resolution and frame-rate scalable subband/wavelet video coder
Abstract: A source-coding algorithm is presented which delivers a  spatiotemporal scalable encoded bitstream.  Motion compensated  temporal filtering is combined with a spatial subband/wavelet  pyramid to provide an efficient 3-D multiresolution representation.   Error-feedback hierarchical coding permits near-optimal results for  each subvideo.  The proposed ordering of refinement addresses the  noncummutative property of motion-compensated temporal filtering and spatial subband/wavelet analysis.  Finally, adaptive conditional  arithmetic coding of quantizer significance maps increases coding  efficiency.  Experimental results demonstrate a significant  improvement in performance over earlier published algorithms.   Thecode-and-refine nature of our hierarchical algorithm makes it  possible to use the algorithm as a scalable extension to other  source coding algorithms.  Finally, the complexity of the algorithm  is modest and is well suited to parallel implementation.  18 Refs.

In this sense, specific  framework can help dealing with such complexity.  This paper  describes such a framework, which has been developed to help  developers in task of modeling and implementation embedded real-time applications.  The framework extends SIMOO-RT, an object-oriented  software tool developed at UFRGS, with the possibility of using  components.  A component library template, the use of a deployment  diagram for the configuration of a given component-based solution to different target architectures, and a new code generator are the  main extensions proposed.  The paper gives an overview on the  proposed extensions, explaining its use by means of some developed  case-studies.  8 Refs.

Title: Divisible e-cash system using secret sharing
Abstract: Divisibility of an e-cash is an important requirement for a practical e-cash system but has no practical solution up to now.  In this  paper, a divisible e-cash system for some special applications is  proposed using the secret sharing scheme.  A verifiable secret  sharing scheme based on the intractable discrete logarithm problem  is put forward as the building block in constructing the e-cash  system.  The e-cash system is smart-card oriented and the card is  denoted as the honest dealer to divide the coin in the payment  protocol.  The security of the divisible e-cash system can be derived directly from the security of the well-known Schnorr identification  and signature schemes and the security of intractable discrete  logarithm problem.

Title: Fair Virtual Clock queueing scheduling algorithm for high-speed  packet switched network
Abstract: In this paper, we present an effective scheduling algorithm based on  virtual clock (VC) algorithm.  Whereas the traditional VC algorithm  lacks of fairness properties, our algorithm exhibits fairness  properties similar to WFQ and keeps the same delay properties as VC  using a system potential function with O(1) complexity.  So, we call  it Fair Virtual Clock (FVC) scheduling algorithm.  In FVC,  computation of system potential function does not require such  division or multiplication operations as in MD-SCFQ.  Compared with  MD-SCFQ, FVC has lower complexity and can be easily implemented in  chips.  We verify the effectivity of proposed FVC through strict  theoretical analysis.  (Author abstract) 14 Refs.

Title: Design and implementation of HFTC2 - a dependable distributed  computer system based diagnosis
Abstract: HFTC  2 is a practical dependable distributed computer system, it  works correctly in the existence of arbitrary fault combination with checkpoint and system-level online diagnosis to exclude the faulty  nodes from the system.  The most important problem of this system is  synchronization, diagnosis and reconfiguration.  This paper describes how to reduce the cost of system synchronization and diagnosis to  eliminate the major performance bottleneck in this fault tolerance  system.  The logical clock replaces the real clock in the system  synchronization, and it overcomes the fundamental limitation of the  system-level diagnosis algorithm.  The algorithm uses only O(N//t**2) messages to detect the faulty nodes in the system where arbitrary  faulty nodes exist.  (Author abstract) 13 Refs.

Title: On the definition of the generalized scattering matrix of a lossless  multiport
Abstract: In this paper, we reconsider the question of the definition of the  generalized scattering matrix (GSM) of a lossless device, and show  the conditions that the GSM must satisfy in order to correctly  represent a lossless device, independently of the method used for  its calculation.  Moreover, starting from circuit theory, possible  choices are considered, and among them the one is examined that  seems to be the most meaningful when dealing with modes below  cutoff.  When the circuit is lossless, in fact, the resulting GSM is  unitary, even when modes below cutoff are taken as accessible.  This  property provides an immediate check of the correctness of the  computational implementation of actual problems.  Finally, a  practical example of the usefulness of the conditions provided is  shown.  (Author abstract) 9 Refs.

Title: Iris recognition for biometric identification using dyadic wavelet  transform zero-crossing
Abstract: In this work, a new biometric identification approach based on the  human iris pattern is proposed.  The main idea of this technique is  to represent the features of the iris by fine-to-coarse  approximations at different resolution levels based on the discrete  dyadic wavelet transform zero-crossing representation.  The resulting one-dimensional (1-D) signals are compared with model features using different distances.  Before performing the feature extraction, a  pre-processing step is to be made by image processing techniques,  isolating the iris and enhancing the area of study.  The proposed  technique is translation, rotation and scale invariant.  Results will show a classification success above 98% achieving an Equal Error  Rate equal to 0, 21% and the possibility of having null False  Acceptance Rates with low False Rejection Rates.  9 Refs.

Title: Metrics for performance evaluation of video object segmentation and  tracking without ground-truth
Abstract: We present metrics to evaluate the performance of video object  segmentation and tracking methods quantitatively when ground-truth  segmentation maps are not available.  The proposed metrics are based  on the color and motion differences along the boundary of the  estimated video object plane and the color histogram differences  between the current object plane and its temporal neighbors.  These  metrics can be used to localize (spatially and/or temporally)  regions where segmentation results are good or bad; or combined to  yield a single numerical measure to indicate the goodness of the  boundary segmentation and tracking results.  Experimental results are presented to evaluate the segmentation map of the "Man" object in  the "Hall Monitor" sequence both in terms of a single numerical  measure, as well as localization of the good and bad segments of the boundary.  8 Refs.

Title: Plenary talk: 15 years of image processing and the fine arts
Abstract: Over the last 20 years, several efforts were devoted to the  application of image processing and digital imaging techniques to  art research in a context of close collaboration between the Centre  de Recherche et de Restauration des Musees de France (C2RMF) and the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Telecommunications (ENST).  These  efforts often found developments within National or European  projects and were only made possible by the strong support of many  partners throughout Europe.  This set of projects and some of its  results are presented here, covering acquisition of information  (from photos, or directly from paintings or objects), as well as  storage management, database consulting, and image processing for  pattern recognition and feature extraction.  35 Refs.

Title: A method to contrast enhancement of digital dense breast images aimed to detect clustered microcalcifications
Abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) schemes have been developed in many  research centers to help the early detection of breast cancer.   However, dense breast images are a challenge to CAD schemes due to  the low contrast between structures of interest (as  microcalcifications - small size structures, which usually are  associated to several breast tumors) and the background.  This work  describes a method to eliminate the background of a digitized  mammogram image as well as two specific techniques to enhance the  contrast in dense breast digital images as part of a CAD scheme  under development in our group.  The results indicate that these  techniques can improve the performance of the scheme, and thus, it  can help in the early detection of breast cancer.  12 Refs.

Title: A new algorithm to correct fish-eye- and strong  wide-angle-lens-distortion from single images
Abstract: The use of super-wide angle and fish-eye lenses causes strong  distortions in the resulting images.  A methodology for the  correction of distortions in these cases using only single images  and linearity of imaged objects is presented in this work.  Contrary  to most former algorithms, the algorithm discussed here does not  depend on information about the real world co-ordinates of matching  points.  Moreover reference points determination and camera  calibration is not required in this case.  The algorithm is based on  circle fitting.  It requires only the possibility of the extraction  of distorted image points from straight lines in the 3D scene.   Further, the actual distortion must approximately fit the chosen  distortion model.  For most fish-eye lenses appropriate distortion  correction results can be obtained.  15 Refs.

Title: Target recognition and tracking in an infrared system
Abstract: In order to demonstrate lock-on-after-launch (LOAL) capability,  imaging infrared missile systems of the future require the ability  to autonomously identify and track targets of interest.  A robust  algorithm architecture must have the flexibility to accommodate the  fluid system requirements that drive its design.  This paper  describes a method to autonomously acquire and track an extended  range target through its entire flight scenario.  A proven automatic  target recognition (ATR) approach is used to detect and identify  targets of interest, separating them into non-targets and clutter.   The methodology uses a down selection strategy to nominate targets  for terminal track.  Once nominated, a Weighted Edge Tracker (WET) is employed.  The tracker relies upon correlations of appropriately  weighted edge directions from frame-to-frame images and reference  templates.  This combination of automatic target acquisition and  terminal tracking provides a sophisticated yet simple approach to  many challenging long range tracking problems.

Title: Adaptive optics development: A 30-year personal perspective
Abstract: The development in the field of adaptive optics was analyzed over a  period of 30 years.  In the late sixties, work was carried out on the multi dither concept which was the initial step in the modern  deformable mirror based adaptive optics.  In the late seventies, work started in the field of adaptive optics system which would project a diffraction limited laser beam onto a scoring board mounted on a  sounding rocket to be launced.  Research on transmission of laser  beams from the ground to satellites was carried out.  It was proposed that detection of the atmospheric back scatter of some laser  radiation would allow the beam direction determination.  A more  reasonable idea for using atmospheric back scatter of a pulsed laser was also proposed.  (Edited abstract)

Title: Utilizing a class labeling feature in an adaptive bayesian classifier
Abstract: In this paper, the Mean-Field Bayesian Data Reduction Algorithm is  developed that adaptively trains on data containing missing values.   In the basic data model for this algorithm each feature vector of a  given class contains a class-labeling feature.  Thus, the methods  developed here are used to demonstrate performance for problems in  which it is desired to adapt the existing training data with data  containing missing values, such as the class-labeling feature.  Given that, the Mean-Field Bayesian Data Reduction Algorithm labels the  adapted data, while simultaneously determining those features that  provide best classification performance.  That is, performance is  improved by reducing the data to mitigate the effects of the curse  of dimensionality.  Further, to demonstrate performance, the  algorithm is compared to the classifier that does not adapt and  bases its decisions on only the prior training data, and also the  optimal clairvoyant classifier.  11 Refs.

Title: Synthesizing invariant 3-D rigid scattering centers
Abstract: Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) is difficult in general, but  especially with RADAR.  However, the problem can be greatly  simplified by using the 3-D reconstruction techniques presented at  SPIE**1**,**2 the previous 2 years.  Now, instead of matching  seemingly random signals in 1-D or 2-D, one must match scattering  centers in 3-D.  This method tracks scattering centers through an  image collection sequence that would typically be used for SAR image formation.  A major difference is that this approach naturally allows object motion (in fact the more the object moves, the better) and  the resulting 'image' is a 3-D set of scattering centers   This paper discusses a preliminary study into extracting the scattering centers directly from synthetic data to build a database in anticipation of  comparing the relative separability of these reconstructed  scattering centers against more traditional approaches for doing  ATR.  11 Refs.

Title: Comparison of some HRR-classification algorithms
Abstract: ATR using HRR-signatures have recently gained lot of attention.  A  number of classification methods have been proposed using different  target descriptions.  The traditionally used classifier utilizing  mean square error between magnitude only range profiles and  templates suffers from problems with interfering scatterers.  Several attempts to improve the MSE classifier both during the template  formation process and in the matching have been made.  We have  recently presented a method that matches complex HRR signatures to  target descriptions that use scattering centers.  This method handle  the unknown phases of the centers and thus overcomes the problem of  interference between scatterers.  In this paper we compare our method with a number of other methods that uses magnitude only range  profiles.  Those includes Mean-templates, Eigen- templates and the  Specular and Diffuse scattering models.  9 Refs.

Title: Partial update of active textures for efficient expression synthesis  in model-based coding
Abstract: An image-based facial expression synthesis method is presented in  this paper for a realistic face animation in model based coding.   Differing from the conventional whole texture update method, we  propose a partial texture update scheme in Active Texture areas to  reduce the bitrate efficiently.  Facial expressions are synthesized  using temporal blending and spatial filtering so that a smooth  texture fusion can be achieved.  Active texture extraction,  compression and composition are the principal steps in realizing the proposed scheme.  The experiments on video sequences demonstrate the  advantage of the proposed algorithm in low cost transmission with  high fidelity reproduction.  The life-like expressive human faces  with wrinkles are generated at a bitrate of less than 40kb/s.  14  Refs.

Title: TV program classification based on face and text processing
Abstract: In this paper we describe a system to classify TV programs into  predefined categories based on the analysis of their video contents.  This is very useful in intelligent display and storage systems that  can select channels and record or skip contents according to the  consumer's preference.  Distinguishable patterns exist in different  categories of TV programs in terms of human faces and super-imposed  text.  By applying face and text tracking to a number of training  video segments, including commercials, news, sitcoms, and soaps, we  have identified patterns within each category of TV programs in a  predefined feature space that reflects the face and text  characteristics of the video.  A given video segment is projected to  the feature space and compared against the distribution of known  categories of TV programs.  Domain-knowledge is used to help the  classification.  Encouraging results have been achieved so far in our initial experiments.  11 Refs.

Title: A hierarchical segmentation algorithm for face analysis. Application  to lipreading
Abstract: A hierarchical algorithm for face analysis is presented in this  paper.  A color video sequence of speaker's face is acquired, under  natural lighting conditions and without any particular make-up.  The  application aims at providing geometrical features of the face for  scalable video transmission when no specific model of the speaker  face is assumed.  First, a logarithmic hue transform is performed  from RGB to HI (hue, intensity) color space.  Next, a Markov random  field modelling regularizes motion and hue information within a  spatiotemporal neighbourhood.  The hierarchical segmentation labels  the different areas of the face.  Results are shown on the lower part of the face and compared with a standard color segmentation  algorithm (fuzzy c-means).  A speaker's lip shape with inner and  outer borders is extracted from the final labeling and used to  initialize an active contour stage.  8 Refs.

Title: A robust algorithm for text extraction in color video
Abstract: We report on the development and implementation of a new algorithm  for extracting text in digitized color video.  The algorithm operates by locating potential text line segments from horizontal scan lines.  Detected text line segments are expanded or combined with text line  segments from adjacent scan lines to form larger text blocks, which  are then subject to filtering and refinement.  Text pixels within  text blocks are then found by using bi-color clustering and  connected-component analysis.  A morphological contour smoothing, and a morphological resolution enhancement algorithms are then applied  to the detected binary texts to enhance their visual quality.  The  implemented algorithm has fast execution time and is effective in  detecting text in difficult cases, such as scenes with highly  textured background, and scenes with small text.  A variety of color  images digitized from broadcast television are used to test the  algorithm and excellent performance result was obtained.  18 Refs.

Title: Supporting multi-example image queries in image databases
Abstract: Query by example (or image) is commonly supported in image databases.  However, it is also desirable for a content-based image retrieval  system to support multi-example queries.  A multi-example query  refers to a query which contains one or more example images.   Although multi-example query problem can be solved by dividing it to several single-example queries, how to merge these single-example  queries' results to find the top n relevant images is a non-trivial  problem.  The Netview system, which is a geographic data retrieval  system developed at the State University of New York at Buffalo,  provides users with flexible choices to adjust query parameters such as importance of each example image and result combination  strategies to generate satisfiable retrieval output.  In this paper,  we formally define the multi-example image query problem.  We then  present a variety of result combination strategies, including linear distance combination and non-linear result combination.  We finally  discuss the experimental performance of these strategies.  6 Refs.

Title: Towards automatic extraction of expressive elements from motion  pictures: Tempo
Abstract: This paper proposes a unique computational approach to extraction of  expressive elements of motion pictures for deriving high level  semantics of stories portrayed, thus enabling better video  annotation and interpretation systems.  This approach, motivated and  directed by the existing cinematic conventions known as film  grammar, as a first step towards demonstrating its effectiveness,  uses the attributes of motion and shot length to define and compute  a novel measure of tempo of a movie.  Tempo flow plots are defined  and derived for four full-length movies and edge analysis is  performed leading to the extraction of dramatic story sections and  events signaled by their unique tempo.  The results confirm tempo as  a useful attribute in its own right and a promising component of  semantic constructs such as tone or mood of a film.  15 Refs.

Title: Human facial expression recognition based on learning subspace method
Abstract: Learning subspace method (LSM) is one of the most important methods  for pattern recognition and it has been successfully used in many  practical applications.  In this paper, we propose to use the LSM for human facial expression recognition.  Seven expression subspaces are  built for expression models.  The idea of recognizing facial  expression through a single static image is realized and the  recognition rate as high as 89.5% is achieved.  In order to make  these expression subspaces more adaptive we can gradually learn them by using the averaged learning subspace method (ALSM).  Experimental  results also indicate that the recognition rate is over 90%.  The  dynamic characteristics of the projection vector sequence on these  facial expression subspaces are also discussed in this paper.  8  Refs.

Abstract: The focus of this paper is to build a set of tools that analyze,  characterize, and prepare footage shot with a camera for  unanticipated uses.  The idea is to take this ensemble of raw stuff  and use it in interesting ways that are not just making a sequence  out of them.  Some of the possible uses of such unstructured video  are: Make a time slice of a person or a series of events, select a  group of shots and make a postcard out of them, make a collage of  shots, make a SalientStill**T**M, storyboard etc. We employ novel  distribution clustering algorithms to enable browsing unstructured  video.  The browser permits navigation of content and extraction of  stills, collages and summaries from unstructured video.  17 Refs.

Title: Secure fragile digital watermarking technique for image  authentication
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new fragile digital watermarking  technique that can be used as a digital signature for data  authentication.  The technique presented is blind, efficient, secure  and can detect and locate minor tampering applied to the image  pixels.  The technique is suitable for certain class of image formats such as gif, tif or bitmap images.  The digital signature is inserted by decorrelating the image samples in the spatial domain, then  embedding the watermark in the transform domain of the decorrelated  image.  The mark is embedded using quantization and modulo arithmetic techniques with a small quantization step size.  Any tampering with  the image will create errors in the embedded bits, which can be  easily detected.  7 Refs.

Title: 2D to pseudo-3D conversion of "head and shoulder" images using  feature based parametric disparity maps
Abstract: This paper presents a method of converting a 2D still photo  containing the head & shoulders of a human (e.g. a passport photo)  to pseudo-3D, so that the depth can be perceived via stereopsis.   This technology has the potential to be included in self-serve photo booths and, also as an added accessory (i.e. software package) for  digital still cameras and scanners.  The basis of the algorithm is to exploit the ability of the human visual system in combining  monoscopic and stereoscopic cues for depth perception.  Common facial features are extracted from the 2D photograph, in order to create a  parametric depth map that conforms to the available monoscopic depth cues.  The original 2D photograph and the created depth map are used  to generate left and right views for stereoscopic viewing.  The  algorithm is implemented in software, and promising results are  obtained.  6 Refs.

Title: Foveated texture mapping with JPEG2000 compression
Abstract: A current technique to control the rendering speed in interactive  virtual worlds is the representation of object geometry using a  hierarchical level of detail.  Missing features can be supplied  through the use of texture maps, but be reduced rendering time is  bought at a trade-off in the amount of memory required to store the  texture images.  Compressed texturing techniques (e.g.  S3TC, FTX1,  VQ) offer some relief, but at a cost to image quality and detail.   This paper proposes a solution using texture images compressed with  JPEG2000.  The foveated JPEG2000 texture mapping method (fJ2k)  decompresses codestreams to resolutions that vary based on current  rendering performance and position of the requested texture image in the field of view.  The final result is a foveated viewport rendered  at interactive framerates using significantly less memory than  current methods.  11 Refs.

Title: Higher order autocorrelations for pattern classification
Abstract: The use of higher-order local autocorrelations as features for  pattern recognition has been acknowledged since many years, but  their applicability was restricted to relatively low orders (2 or 3) and small local neighborhoods, due to combinatorial increase in  computational costs.  In this paper a new method for using these  features is presented, which allows the use of autocorrelations of  any order and of larger neighborhoods.  The method is closely related to the classifier used, a Support Vector Machine (SVM), and exploits the special form of the inner products of autocorrelations and the  properties of some kernel functions used by SVMs.  Using SVM, linear  and non-linear classification functions can be learned, extending  the previous works on higher-order autocorrelations which were based on linear classifiers.  9 Refs.

Title: Edge preserving pre-post filtering for low bitrate video coding
Abstract: Post filtering is an effective tool for reducing coding artifacts in  video coding.  Most post-filtering tools are based on lowpass  filtering, and an edge preserving filtering is useful because edges  have an important effect on visual quality.  An edge preserving  filtering has an edge detection step, region detection step, and  filtering step.  The effectiveness of such filtering is much affected by the edge detection feature.  Therefore edge detection threshold  should be carefully determined.  We created a new method of  determining the edge detection threshold of a post filter, that is  based on the pre-filtering features and encoding conditions.   Computer simulations show that this method achieves the best visual  quality for given pre filtering and encoding conditions.  9 Refs.

Title: A hybrid lossless compression scheme using region-based predictive  coding and integer wavelet transform
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid scheme for lossless compression of the  X-ray non-destructive testing (NDT) images of aircraft components.   The method combines the predictive coding and the integer wavelet  transform (IWT).  Furthermore, with the aid of component CAD models  to divide the X-ray images of aircraft components into different  regions based on the material structures, the design of the  predictors and the choice of the IWT are optimised according to the  specific image features contained in each region having the same  material structure.  Using a real X-ray image of a practical aircraft component, the proposed hybrid scheme is presented and shown to  offer a significantly higher compression ratio than other lossless  compression schemes.  7 Refs.

Title: Constant pace skimming and temporal sub-sampling of video using  motion activity
Abstract: We describe a "constant pace" framework for video summarization via  fast playback or temporal sub-sampling.  The pace of the summary  serves as a parameter that enables production of a video summary of  any desired length.  Earlier, we showed that the intensity of motion  activity (or pace) of a video sequence is a good indication of its  "summarizability." Here we build on this notion by adapting the  playback frame-rate or the temporal sub-sampling rate to the pace.   Either the less active parts of the sequence are played back at a  faster frame rate or the less active parts of the sequence are  sub-sampled more heavily than are the more active parts, so as to  produce a summary with constant pace.  The basic idea is to skip over the less interesting parts of the video.  Our technique is  computationally simple and gives satisfactory results with  surveillance and entertainment video.  7 Refs.

Title: Non-sequential video structuring based on video object linking: An  efficient tool for video browsing and indexing
Abstract: An efficient system for unsupervised structuring of stereoscopic  sequences is presented in this paper, which generates links between  similar VOPs of different shots.  Particularly after shot cut  detection, for each shot, a fast, unsupervised VOP detection and  tracking algorithm is applied.  Then for each of the foreground VOPs  of a frame, a feature vector is constructed using low level features of the VOP as color and size.  Afterwards, for a given shot, key-VOP  poses are extracted for each VOP, using an optimization method for  locating VOP poses of minimally correlated feature vectors.  Finally  an iterative process is performed to link each key VOP of a shot to  another, according to a correlation measure.  Experimental results  indicate the promising performance of the proposed system on real  life stereoscopic video sequences.  13 Refs.

Title: Summarizing wearable video
Abstract: "We want to record our entire life by video" is the motivation of  this research.  Recently developing wearable devices and huge storage devices will make it possible to keep entire life by video.  We could capture 70 years of our life, however, the problem is how to handle  such a huge data.  Automatic summarization based on personal interest should be required.  In this paper we propose an approach to  automatic structuring and summarization of wearable video.  (Wearable video is our abbreviation of "video captured by a wearable camera".) In our approach, we make use of a wearable camera and a sensor of  brain waves.  The video is firstly structured by objective features  of video, and the shots are rated by subjective measures based on  brain waves.  The approach were very successful for real world  experiments and it automatically extracted all the events that the  subjects reported they had felt interesting.  5 Refs.

Title: Scene break detection and classification using a block-wise  difference method
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to the detection and the classification  of effects in video sequences.  We deal with effects such as cuts,  fades, dissolves, and camera motion.  A global motion compensation  based on block matching and a measure of block mean intensities are  used to detect all the effects.  We compute the dominant motion  vectors to detect the camera motion for each shot and we use the  percentage of blocks with sudden intensity variations or gradual  intensity change to detect change effects between video shots.  The  approach can handle complex motion during gradual effects as well as the precise detection of effect lengths.  Both synthetic and real  evidences are presented to demonstrate how this approach can  efficiently classify effects in video sequences involving  significant motion.  7 Refs.

Title: Meta-data framework for constructing individualized video digest
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for providing video digests that are  personalized by profiles of individual users.  Video contents have  meta-data described manually from a set of predefined keywords that  have temporal duration.  Content profiles are prepared by a provider, which are vectors of importance value of keywords, and the only one  should be selected by a user.  In addition, a user profile is  collected by the user, which has the same components.  The importance scores of an image sequence along the time axis can be calculated  from the combination of these profiles.  Finally, the video clips can be collected as the video digest from the whole contents, which have higher importance scores than a threshold transformed from the  length of the user requirement.  6 Refs.

Title: Polynomial fiber description of motion for video mosaicking
Abstract: This paper is about two topics.  First, given a video sequence, we  introduce a Bayesian framework, where background and moving objects  are segmented into layers.  The model that describes the different  layer evolutions in a sequence of images uses the results of a  multi-frame optical flow estimation (MFOFE); we present a new  technique based on the fact that each pixel in the frame of  reference produces the trajectory in the mosaic absolute coordinate  system.  The second topic is video summarization.  A general  mosaicking method is presented for describing the background and the trajectories of moving objects in a sequence of frames.  Combining  layer segmentation and mosaicking, we show different manners of  encoding and visualizing temporal information, where the key point  is the selection of a certain object in the images as reference in  the evolution.  8 Refs.

Title: Camera working parameter extraction for constructing video  considering camera shake
Abstract: With the increasing popularity of high performance DV cameras and  video editing applications on PCs, desktop videos have become more  attractive.  Video editing and summary, however, still poses problems as it lacks useful support tools, which can efficiently show the  video contents to editors.  Against this background, our goal is to  build a useful video-editing system grounded on techniques of  content analysis.  On the basis of our Video Document Architecture  concept, we regard camera work parameters as a means of reference to construct video.  Camera work parameters can be defined follows: (1)  a variety of camera work patterns (such as panning and zooming,  etc.), and (2) the quality of camera work of speed and camera shake  rate.  By calculating these parameters, we aim to build a system,  enabling one to detect significant scene candidates from the  original shot sequence as well as edit videos automatically.  4 Refs.

Title: A unified memory-based approach to cut, dissolve, key frame and scene analysis
Abstract: We review a memory-based buffer model of visual perception, that  combines the lower and middle stages in the analysis of video.  This  model was originally developed for the detection of breaks between  physical scene changes ("story units").  In this paper we show how  this method can also be applied for shot detection.  Moreover, it  gives rise to a unified approach for detecting cuts and gradual  changes.  Additionally, as a straightforward corollary to its  definition, it leads to a more natural definition of key frames.  We  derive the theoretic performance of the model, given arbitrary  measures of frame-to-frame dissimilarity.  We show several examples  of its response, using standard color histogram differencing (with  the L//1 norm as measure).  We evaluate the model's performance in  detecting cuts and dissolves against a complete hand-segmented  situation comedy.  8 Refs.

Title: Recognising human and animal movement by symmetry
Abstract: We show how the symmetry of motion can be extracted by using the  Generalised Symmetry Operator for analysing motion and for gait  recognition.  This operator, rather than relying on the borders of a  shape or on general appearance, locates features by their  symmetrical properties.  This approach is reinforced by the view from psychology that human gait is a symmetrical pattern of motion, and  by other works.  We applied our new method to compare animal gait,  and for recognition by gait.  Results show that the symmetry  properties of gait appear to be unique and can indeed be used for  analysis and for recognition.  We have so far achieved promising  recognition rates of over 95%.  Performance analysis also suggests  that symmetry enjoys practical advantages such as relative immunity  to noise with capability to handle occlusion and as such might prove suitable for applications like clip-database browsing.  11 Refs.

Title: Fingerprint matching using minutiae and texture features
Abstract: The advent of solid-state fingerprint sensors presents a fresh  challenge to traditional fingerprint matching algorithms.  These  sensors provide a small contact area ( approximately equals 0.6  double prime multiplied by 0.6 double prime ) for the fingertip and, therefore, sense only a limited portion of the fingerprint.  Thus  multiple impressions of the same fingerprint may have only a small  region of overlap.  Minutiae-based based matching algorithms, which  consider ridge activity only in the vicinity of minutiae points, are not likely to perform well on these images due to the insufficient  number of corresponding points in the input and template images.  We  present a hybrid matching algorithm that uses both minutiae (point)  information and texture (region) information for matching the  fingerprints.  Results obtained on the MSU  VERIDICOM database shows  that a combination of the texture-based and minutiae-based matching  scores leads to a substantial improvement in the overall matching  performance.  6 Refs.

Title: Minutiae extraction scheme for fingerprint recognition systems
Abstract: A complete minutiae extraction scheme for automatic fingerprint  recognition systems is presented.  The proposed method uses improving alternatives for the image enhancement process, leading consequently to an increase of the reliability in the minutiae extraction task.   In the first stages, image normalization and orientation field of  the fingerprint are calculated.  The local orientation of the ridges  will serve as parameter for the next processing stages.  Details for  the adaptive morphological filtering used to ridge extraction and  background noise elimination are described.  Evaluation results are  obtained from both inked and scanned fingerprints.  Conclusions in  terms of Goodness Index (GI), which compares the results obtained by automatic minutiae extraction with manually extracted ones, are  provided in order to test the global performance of this approach.  6 Refs.

Title: Improved ROI and within frame discriminant features for lipreading
Abstract: We study three aspects of designing appearance based visual features  for automatic lipreading: (a) The choice of the video region of  interest (ROI), on which image transform features are obtained; (b)  The extraction of speech discriminant features at each frame; and  (c) The use of temporal information to improve visual speech  modeling.  In particular, with respect to (a), we propose a ROI that  includes the speaker's jaw and cheeks, in addition to the  traditionally used mouth/lip region; with respect to (b) and (c), we propose the use of a two-stage linear discriminant analysis, both  within frame, as well as across a large number of frames.  On a  large-vocabulary, continuous speech audio-visual database, the  proposed visual features result in a 13% absolute reduction in  visual-only word error rate over a baseline visual front end, and in an additional 28% relative improvement in audio-visual over  audio-only phonetic classification accuracy.  19 Refs.

Title: A study of fingerprint image filtering
Abstract: Fingerprint image enhancement is a crucial step in automatic  fingerprint recognition.  Quite a lot of approaches for filtering the fingerprint image have been suggested.  Most of them perform oriented band pass filtering.  However, such filters, for example, Gabor  filters, may create spurious ridge structure information.  This is  harmful for the feature extraction and therefore is harmful for the  automatic fingerprint recognition.  This paper examines the  properties of applying Gabor filter in the fingerprint image  enhancement.  It shows that the non-sinusoidal-shaped ridge  structure, the ridge frequency estimation error and the small filter size are the causes of creating spurious ridge structures.  As a  solution, we suggest an adaptive oriented low pass filter instead of Gabor filter to avoid producing undesired harmful side effects for  the automatic fingerprint recognition.  11 Refs.

Title: Palmprint recognition using crease
Abstract: Palmprint has one special salient feature which is not salient in  fingerprint.  That is crease.  In palmprint the creases are large in  number and comparatively easy to extract.  Creases are also  approximately stable in a person's whole life, which qualifies  themselves as features in palmprint recognition.  In this paper, we  give creases an accurate definition which is fit for algorithm  implement.  We devised a rather exquisite algorithm to extract all  the creases in a palmprint whose success is mainly from a new  different direction computing method and a thorough local analysis  and a robust search algorithm.  Based on the extracted creases, we  devised a robust palmprint matching algorithm which is rotation and  translation invariant.  The crease extraction results and palmprint  matching results show that crease can be extracted successfully and  crease-based palmprint matching is robust and accurate.  7 Refs.

Title: A window-based gray-scale inverse Hough transform algorithm and its  applications on gray-scale line filtering
Abstract: This paper proposes a window-based gray-scale Inverse Hough  Transform.  The proposed algorithm can be applied to any gray-scale  image and allows the line extraction according to filtering  conditions.  The technique reduces the computational time and the  memory storage requirements of the inversion procedure considering  the image as a set of sub-windows and working only with the  necessary gray-scale values.  Also, a new improved definition of the  representation of a straight line in the accumulator array is used  that takes into account the image quantization effects and allows  the extraction of lines with variable thickness.  The pixels of the  resulting lines in the final image appear in their exact position  and have gray-scale values as in the original gray-scale image.  8  Refs.

Title: Feature based global and local motion estimation for videoconference  sequences
Abstract: In this work, we present an algorithm for face 3D motion estimation  in videoconference scenes.  The algorithm uses a modification of the  CANDIDE face model and is based on feature tracking and the extended Kalman filter (EKF).  Various techniques are adopted to increase the  robustness of the feature tracking procedure and, in particular, a  filtering technique on reference blocks.  Global motion estimation is used as a starting point for local motion detection.  To this  purpose, we generate, by texture mapping, a synthetic image of the  mouth, whose shape is changed using a set of action units (AUs).  The optimal AU values are determined via a gradient-based minimization  procedure of the error energy between the template and the actual  mouth image.  The proposed scheme is quite robust and was tested with success on long sequences.  15 Refs.

Title: Jointly optimal coding of texture and shape
Abstract: A major problem in object oriented video coding and MPEG-4 is the  encoding of object boundaries.  Traditionally, and within MPEG-4, the encoding of shape and texture information are separate steps (the  extraction of shape is not considered by the standards).  In this  paper, we present a vertex-based shape coding method which is  optimal in the operational rate-distortion sense and takes into  account the texture information of the video frames.  This is  accomplished by utilizing a variable-width tolerance band which is  proportional to the degree of trust in the accuracy of the shape  information at that location.  Thus, in areas where the confidence in the estimation of the boundary is not high and/or coding errors in  the boundary will not affect the application (object oriented  coding, MPEG-4, etc.) significantly, a larger boundary approximation error is allowed.  We present experimental results which demonstrate  the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.  9 Refs.

Title: Adaptive video background modeling using color and depth
Abstract: A new algorithm for background estimation and removal in video  sequences obtained with stereo cameras is presented.  Per-pixel  Gaussian mixtures are used to model recent scene observations in the combined space of depth and luminance-invariant color.  These mixture models adapt over time, and are used to build a new model of the  background at each time step.  This combination in itself is novel,  but we also introduce the idea of modulating the learning rate of  the background model according to the scene activity level on a  per-pixel basis, so that dynamic foreground objects are incorporated into the background more slowly than are static scene changes.  Our  results show much greater robustness than prior state-of-the-art  methods to challenging phenomena such as video displays, non-static  background objects, areas of high foreground traffic, and similar  color of foreground and background.  Our method is also well-suited  for use in real-time systems.  8 Refs.

Title: Region extraction method based on clustering along an object contour
Abstract: For accurate region extraction, region-based active contour models  (ACM) have been proposed.  Compared with ordinary ACM, they require  heavier loads of initial settings and further processing time.   Considering these problems, for effective and efficient extraction,  we propose a new region-based ACM.  In the proposed method, first,  users draw an initial curve in an object.  Along this curve, definite length scanlines are set perpendicular to the initial curve and  across the object contour.  Depending on the image properties around  scanlines, the scanlines are separated into several groups and each  group is divided into two subregions (object and background  regions).  Scanlines grouping and groups dividing are iterated until  the image properties are sufficiently uniform in each subregion.   Through this clustering, a region along an object contour is  segmented into subregions of uniform image properties, and  consequently the image properties in a necessary and sufficient area are introduced into extraction process effectively.  8 Refs.

Title: Face recognition using fractal codes
Abstract: In this paper we propose a new method for face recognition using  fractal codes.  Fractal codes represent local contractive, affine  transformations which when iteratively applied to range-domain pairs in an arbitrary initial image result in a fixed point close to a  given image.  The transformation parameters such as brightness  offset, contrast factor, orientation and the address of the  corresponding domain for each range are used directly as features in our method.  Features of an unknown face image are compared with  those pre-computed for images in a database.  There is no need to  iterate, use fractal neighbor distances or fractal dimensions for  comparison in the proposed method.  This method is robust to scale  change, frame size change and rotations as well as to some noise,  facial expression and blur distortion in the image.  15 Refs.

Title: Recognition of anatomically relevant objects with binary partition  trees
Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate the application of a binary partition  tree to the watershed segmentation with graph merging.  An adjacency  graph is used to represent the regions found in a watershed  transform, merging of these regions is required to combine these  regions for further processing.  Each node in the binary partition  tree represents a larger region that results from the merging of two small regions.  Starting from the root node, image areas of child  nodes can successively be investigated whether they belong to a  certain class of objects.  In our application we are e.g. interested  in finding anatomical objects such as skull, lung, or heart in an  x-ray image.  The outlined classification strategy considers only a  few, relevant region combinations and thus permits the introduction  of sophisticated classification rules without compromising overall  computation time.  The use of rules improves the recognition rate  over simpler linear or box-type classifiers.  4 Refs.

Title: An acquisition method of 3-dimensional video components for  image-based virtual studio
Abstract: We are studying an image-based virtual studio [1 right  bracket .  This type of virtual studio makes it possible to  reconstruct realistic synthesized video by extracting shape,  texture, and other necessary information (called video components)  from each object in the subject video for use on the set.  When using video components made up of shape and texture information to  reconstruct natural-looking video under any lighting conditions,  lighting effects like highlights and shading that are present at the time of measurement must be removed from texture information.  For  this purpose, the authors have proposed a technique that uses  polarized light on the lighting side and a polarized filter on the  camera side, and have confirmed its effectiveness by experiments.  6  Refs.

Title: Automatic location of optic disk in retinal images
Abstract: On the research work leading to automatic analysis of retinal fundus  images the knowledge of optic disk location is very essential, and a new method to automatically locate optic disk is proposed in this  paper.  The candidate regions are first determined by clustering the  brightest pixels in intensity image.  Principal Component Analysis  (PCA) is then applied to these candidate regions.  The minimum  distance between the original retinal image and its projection onto  "disk space" is located as the center of optic disk.  The algorithm  has been tested and compared with another commonly used method and  the results show that the method proposed here can automatically  provide more acceptable location of the optic disk.  5 Refs.

Title: Anti-geometric diffusion for adaptive thresholding and segmentation
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel adaptive thresholding technique  based upon an anisotropic diffusion model, which may be referred to  as the anti-geometric heat flow.  In contrast to its more popular  counterparts (such as the geometric heat flow) which diffuse  parallel to image edges, this model diffuses perpendicular to image  edges, yielding surfaces which are naturally suited for adaptive  thresholding and segmentation.  While it is possible to apply this  diffusion for a fixed amount of time to detect features, we discuss  how to detect features during the diffusion process, thus avoiding  much of the arbitrariness associated with choosing a single scale  (and makes the most notorious problem associated with anisotropic  diffusion methods, namely "when do you stop?" a moot point).  We will demonstrate the performance of this technique on both synthetic and  real images, showing applications to thresholding written text and  segmentation of medical images and scenes.  16 Refs.

Title: Retrieval of overlapping and touching objects using hidden markov  models
Abstract: In this paper a content-based image retrieval system for overlapping  and touching objects based on hidden Markov models is introduced.  In a first step unsupervised clustering in the color and position space is performed in order to separate the objects.  The clusters are  handed over to the feature extraction, which is basically a polar  subsampling and finally rotation invariant Markov models are trained on those features.  After presenting a query object, the HMMs which  represent the individual clusters in the images are matched against  the feature sequence calculated on the query image.  Those database  elements whose corresponding Markov models generated the highest  similarity scores are retrieved.  Three different clustering  techniques, namely k-means clustering, LBG-algorithm and  EM-algorithm are evaluated.  Retrieval effiencies up to 56.25% have  been achieved on this challenging task.  11 Refs.

Abstract: The unsupervised learning network is explored to incorporate  self-learning capability into image retrieval systems.  More  specifically, we propose the adoption of a Self Organizing Tree Map  (SOTM) to implement a self-learning methodology that allows  minimization of the role of users in an effort to automate  interactive retrieval.  This automatic learning modes is applied to  interactive retrieval strategies such as the radial basis function  method and the relevance feedback method.  The proposed method has  beem applied to retrieve the images compressed by wavelet transform  and vector quantization coders.  Retrieval performances are compared  with conventional retrieval systems employing both non-iterative and user controlled iteractive retrieval using the MIT texture database.  The results obtained are compared favorably with preceding methods.   9 Refs.

Title: On hierarchical multimedia information retrieval
Abstract: This paper presents a data warehousing approach to hierarchical  multimedia information retrieval.  To tackle the key issues such as  multimedia data representation, storage, integration, indexing,  similarity measures, searching methods and query processing, the  proposed algorithms allow one: 1) to extend the concepts of  conventional data warehouse and multimedia databases to multimedia  data warehouses for effective data representation and storage; 2) to develop a multimedia starflake schema to integrate multiple data  streams for hierarchical data representation and indexing; 3) to  apply data aggregation techniques for decision support to speed up  query processing and searching.  In addition, the new system  architecture is compared with a conventional database structure.   Furthermore, a case study is presented to illustrate the development of a content-based image retrieval system for cyclone pattern  recognition.  We conclude that the proposed approach can be applied  to other multimedia systems with effective data storage, retrieval  and integration.  8 Refs.

Title: Subject region segmentation in disparity maps for image retrieval
Abstract: The paper presents a method to automatically extract subject regions  to be used as a key for image retrieval.  If one wants to look up a  particular object in image database, a key image region of the  object should be properly indicated to the system.  However, this  task is not trivial.  In our approach, we assume that we have actual  object in the real world to be looked up in image database.  Taking  advantage of disparity images using a commercially available stereo  range finder, we automate subject region extraction.  We assume that  3-D points in a dense disparity map yield multimodal Gaussian  probability distribution, and subject regions are extracted by  properly selecting particular modes of Gaussian densities.  We  demonstrate that the system somehow extracts regions which  correspond to "subjects." The system achieves adaptive and quick  extraction, and it enables the experimental image retrieval by real  object system which runs interactively.  4 Refs.

Title: Content-based objects detection for the recognition of building  images
Abstract: This paper deals with content-based objects detection for the  recognition of building images.  The aim of this research is to  develop a robust method by which the building images taken under  different imaging conditions like view, illumination and scale can  be recognized correctly.  In the approach presented in this paper,  the regions of objects like windows and wall are first detected from a building image based on their visual contents.  Here, the  segmentation of regions is done using color information and the  regions of windows and wall are detected based on edge information  and the location of regions.  Then, some features like the  proportions of width to height of windows and the invariant color  features extracted from the region of wall are extracted for the  robust recognition of building images.  Finally, experimental results will reveal the efficacy of the method proposed in this paper.  5  Refs.

Title: Face modeling for recognition
Abstract: 3D Human face models have been widely used in applications such as  facial animation, video compression/coding, augmented reality, head  tracking, facial expression recognition, human action recognition,  and face recognition.  Modeling human faces provides a potential  solution to identifying faces with variations in illumination, pose, and facial expression.  We propose a method of modeling human faces  based on a generic face model (a triangular mesh model) and  individual facial measurements containing both shape and texture  information.  The modeling method adapts a generic face model to the  given facial features, extracted from registered range and color  images, in a global-to-local fashion.  It iteratively moves the  vertices of the mesh model to smoothen the non-feature areas, and  uses the 2.5D active contours to refine feature boundaries.  The  resultant face model has been shown to be visually similar to the  rule face.  Initial results show that the constructed model is quite  useful for recognizing nonfrontal views.  15 Refs.

Title: Facial feature extraction and image warping using PCA based statistic model
Abstract: A new algorithm is proposed to extract the facial features and  estimate the control points for facial image warping using the  Principle Component Analysis (PCA) based statistic face model.  In  this algorithm, first a full-face model consisting the contour  points and the control points is built.  Based on a number of  manually marked training samples, the prior distribution of the  full-face model can be obtained by using the PCA.  Given an input  face image, first the contour points are obtained by using the  recently developed Bayesian Shape Model (BSM), and then the control  points are estimated from the contour points.  Finally, the extracted face path is normalized using the piece-wise affine triangle warping algorithm.  Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the  proposed algorithm.  8 Refs.

Title: Similarity matching of arbitrarily shaped video by still shape  features and shape deformations
Abstract: The increasing availability of object-based video content requires  new technologies for automatically extracting and matching of the  low level features of arbitrarily shaped video.  In this paper, we  propose methods for the efficient retrieval of video object shapes.   Our methods take into account not only the still shape features but  also the shape deformations that may occur in the lifespan of video  objects.  We define a new shape similarity measure that is based on  the shape similarity of the representative temporal instances of  video objects.  We also propose shape deformation features that are  based on the variances of the still shape features.  The proposed  visual features can be derived directly from the MPEG-4 compressed  domain or computed from the shape masks of the video objects in the  spatial domain.  Our experiments show that our proposed methods offer very good retrieval results.  8 Refs.

Title: Tube-embodied gradient vector flow fields for unsupervised video  object plane (VOP) segmentation
Abstract: In this paper constrained Gradient Vector Flow (GVF) field generation is performed, for fast and accurate unsupervised stereoscopic  semantic segmentation.  The scheme utilizes the information provided  by a depth segments map, produced by stereo analysis methods and  incorporation of a segmentation algorithm.  Then a Canny edge  detector is applied to the depth region and produces an edge map.   The edge map is used for tube estimation inside which the GVF field  evolves.  After generation of the GVF field an active contour is  unsupervisedly initialized onto the outer bound of the tube.  Finally a greedy approach is adopted and the active contour, guided by the  GVF field, extracts the VOP.  Experimental results on real life  stereoscopic video sequences indicate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.  11 Refs.

Title: A watermarking scheme for digital cinema
Abstract: In this paper a video watermarking scheme is presented, that is  designed for the future digital cinema format, as it will be used on large projector screens in theatres.  The watermark is designed such  that it has minimal impact on the video quality, but still is  detectable after capture with a handheld camera and conversion to,  for instance, VHS, CD-Video or DVD format.  In order to achieve the  severe requirements, concerning visibility and robustness, the  proposed watermarking system only exploits the temporal axis.  A  watermark is inserted by changing the mean of the luminance values  of a frame according to the samples of the watermark.  Watermark  detection is performed by correlating the watermark sequence with  extracted mean luminance values of a sequence of frames.  A  demonstrator, implementing the proposed algorithm, has been built  which shows the aforementioned requirements can be met with the  proposed scheme.  7 Refs.

Title: Memory-efficient fingerprint verification
Abstract: Fingerprint recognition and verification are often based on local  fingerprint features, usually ridge endings or terminations, also  called minutiae.  By exploiting the structural uniqueness of the  image region around a minutia, the fingerprint recognition  performance can be significantly enhanced.  However, for most  fingerprint images the number of minutia image regions (MIR's)  becomes dramatically large, which imposes - especially for embedded  systems - an enormous memory requirement.  Therefore, we are  investigating different algorithms for compression of minutia  regions.  The requirement for these algorithms is to achieve a high  compression rate (about 20) with minimum loss in the matching  performance of minutia image region matching.  In this paper we  investigate the matching performance for compression algorithms  based on the Principal Component and the wavelet transformation.  The matching results are presented in form of normalized ROC curves and  interpreted in terms of compression rates and the MIR dimension.  13  Refs.

Title: Total variation for the removal of blocking effects in DCT based  encoding
Abstract: Quantization in block DCT based codecs can produce noticeable image  artifacts.  Anisotropic diffusion has been proposed as a remedy for  removing such undesirable blocking effects.  The main disadvantage of that approach is that artifacts near high-contrast image features  are not adequately reduced.  In this paper, we propose an alternative non-linear method that reduces artifacts by minimizing the total  variation of the reconstructed image in the vicinity of DCT block  boundaries.  This minimization is achieved via a level set  formulation.  Our experimental results indicate that the proposed  method removes the blocking artifact effectively, producing an image with smooth level sets in the region interiors as well as near the  true edges of the image.  9 Refs.

Title: Simultaneous feature tracking and three-dimensional object  reconstruction from an image sequence
Abstract: Most existing work on the recovery of scene structure from an image  sequence assume prior knowledge of the camera or do not attempt to  recover metric geometry, and that feature points have been extracted with the required correspondences established, often by human  operators.  This paper presents a scheme that removed the above  assumptions.  Using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) framework the  scheme performs simultaneous corner feature tracking with  correspondence analysis, and the reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) rigid objects.  The paper introduces the concept of individual  global rotation quaternions and translational offset vectors so that it is not necessary for all features associated with an object to be present in the first frame of the image sequence.  Experiments on two image sequences containing a soccer ball and a model house show the  potential and effectiveness of the scheme.  9 Refs.

Title: Object extraction and tracking using genetic algorithms
Abstract: To support the content-based functionalities in the new video coding  standard MPEG-4, each frame of a video sequence must first be  extracted into video object planes, each of which represents a  meaningful moving object.  However, extraction and tracking a video  sequence into video object planes remains a difficult and unresolved problem.  Accordingly, this paper presents objects extraction and  tracking method based on genetic algorithms that can automatically  extract and track moving objects.  Each frame is spatially segmented  by chromosomes that evolve using distributed genetic algorithms.   Thereafter, the spatial segmentation result is combined with a  change detection mask, thereby creating the video object planes.  To  eliminate any redundant computation and maintain the temporal  continuity of the same objects between two consecutive frames, the  chromosomes are started from the spatial segmentation result of the  previous frame, and then only unstable chromosomes corresponding to  the moving object parts are evolved.  Experiment results demonstrate  the effectiveness of the proposed method.  7 Refs.

Title: An unsupervised multi-resolution object extraction algorithm using  video-cube
Abstract: We propose a fast video object segmentation method that detects  object boundaries accurately, and does not require any user  assistance.  Video streams are considered as 3D data, called  video-cubes, to take advantage of 3D signal processing techniques.   After a video sequence is filtered, marker nodes are selected from  the color gradient.  A volume around each marker is grown by using  color/texture distance criteria.  Then volumes that have similar  characteristics are merged.  Self-descriptors for each volume,  mutual-descriptors for each pair of volumes are computed.  These  descriptors capture motion and spatial information of volumes.  In  the clustering stage, volumes are classified into objects in a  fine-to-coarse hierarchy.  While applying and relaxing descriptor  based adaptive, similarity scores are estimated for each possible  pair-wise combination of volumes.  The pair that gives the maximum  score is clustered iteratively.  Finally, an object-based  multi-resolution representation tree is assembled.  4 Refs.

Title: Efficient and robust vehicle localization
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for efficient and robust  pose determination of vehicles in traffic scenes from single  monocular intensity images using calibrated cameras.  We consider the pose determination process as a series of evolutions from initial  pose to correct pose in 3D space, which can be decomposed into two  independent 3D motions: translation and rotation.  The translation  parameters are obtained based on Point-to-Line-Segment Distance (PLS Distance), while the rotation parameters are determined by geometric relationships among a set of specially constructed but imaginary  planes.  Closed-form solutions to both sub-problems are obtained,  thus avoiding the usual shortcoming of relatively high computational cost of traditional 3D-model based approaches.  In addition, Vertex  Neighborhood Constraint (VNC) is introduced to improve the  robustness of the method.  Experimental results show that the  algorithm works well even under severe occlusion and clutter.  7  Refs.

Abstract: In this article, we propose a "Shape From Texture" method computed on two steps.  First a new local scales extraction technique is  proposed.  The local scale of each point of the picture is computed  from an interpolation of wavelet values.  Then an interpolation of  the local scale map is develop.  The method used in an improvement on the one introduced by Lu et al. [9] .  It  consists in making a local scales interpolation of a textured slope  plan's picture, to recover its orientation under the perspective  projection model.  The aim of this paper is also to present the  precision that we have to expect from these methods.  We study the  influence of the different parameters to the results.  To end we  compare our results with Lu's one on about a hundred of textured  plane pictures.  These results confirm the precision study.  12 Refs.

Title: Rotationally invariant texture based features
Abstract: Content-based retrieval is ultimately dependent on the features used  for the annotation of data and its efficiency is dependent on the  invariance and robust properties of these textures.  For texture  based features an important form of invariance is rotational  invariance.  In this paper novel rotationally invariant texture based features are introduced that are extracted from a Polar Fourier  Transform (PFT).  The PFT is similar to the Discrete Fourier  Transform in two dimensions but uses transform parameters radius and angle rather than the Cartesian co-ordinates.  The PFT is discretised appropriately across the angular and radial frequency space with the transform magnitudes forming the rotationally invariant features.   These features although rotationally invariant, capture the angular  distribution together with the radial distribution of frequency  within texture.  Preliminary results show the method to give better  results than rotationally variant and invariant Gabor filter  schemes.  11 Refs.

Title: Invariant and perceptually consistent texture mapping for  content-based image retrieval
Abstract: Texture is an important visual feature for content-based image  retrieval.  An ideal content-based retrieval system should compare  images in its database with the query in a manner that is consistent with human's perception of visual similarity.  Moreover, texture  matching should be invariant to texture scale and orientation  because the same texture can appear in the images in varying scales  and orientations.  In practice, however, texture similarity computed  using computational texture features is not necessarily consistent  with human's perception.  This paper presents a method of mapping  texture features into a texture space that is scale and orientation  invariant, and at the same time, consistent with human's perception.  Test results show that this method achieves better retrieval  performance than methods that are not invariant and not perceptually consistent.  14 Refs.

Title: Active mesh for video segmentation and objects tracking
Abstract: The new MPEG-4 standard will provide superior services for the user,  as it introduces the video objects concept.  However, there is no  generic segmentation technique able to provide the segmentation maps for such a coding system.  In this paper, we propose a novel  mesh-based video segmentation and objects tracking algorithm with  both robust motion estimation and modeling of motion  discontinuities.  In addition, occlusions and uncovered regions are  well managed.  This allows the mesh deformation without the need to  process remeshing in motion occlusion regions.  The spatial  properties of each frame are considered to make the mesh edges fit  the image contents and a temporal smoothness constraint is also  implemented.  The proposed algorithm is able to segment multiple  objects at the same time.  Some experimental results are shown.  9  Refs.

For simplification, the GMM is assumed diagonal covariance matrixes.  In case of the  features of handwritten numerals are correlated statistically, a  large number of mixture components are usually needed to obtain a  good approximation.  To solve this problem, the feature vectors are  first transformed to the space spanned by the eigenvectors of the  covariance matrix so that the correction among the elements is  reduced, namely orthogonal transformation.  This GMM is defined as  orthogonal Gaussian mixture model (OGMM).  Finally, the effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to the NIST  database.  7 Refs.

Title: Similarity measure for CCITT group 4 compressed document images
Abstract: Similarity measure of document images acts a crucial role in the area of document image retrieval.  A method of measuring the similarity of CCITT Group 4 compressed document images is proposed in this paper.   The features are extracted directly from the changing elements of  the compressed images.  Weighted Hausdorff distance is utilized to  assign all of the word objects from two document images to  corresponding classes by an unsupervised classifier, whereas the  possible stop words are excluded.  Document vectors are built by the  occurrence frequency of the word object classes, and the pair-wise  similarity of two document images is represented by the scalar  product of the document vectors.  Five group articles relating to  different domains are used to test the validity of the presented  approach.  8 Refs.

Title: Word shape recognition for image-based document retrieval
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a word shape recognition method for  retrieving image-based documents.  Document images are segmented at  the word level first.  Then the proposed method detects local extrema points in word segments to form so-called vertical bar patterns.   These vertical bar patterns form the feature vector of a document.   Scalar product of two document feature vectors is calculated to  measure the pair-wise similarity of document images.  The proposed  method is robust to changing fonts and styles, and is less affected  by degradation of document qualities.  Three groups of words in  different fonts and image qualities were used to test the validity  of our method.  Real-life document images were also used to test the  method's ability of retrieving relevant documents.  7 Refs.

Title: Text-based geometric normalization for robust watermarking of digital maps
Abstract: The peculiarities of digital maps images are exploited to develop a  watermarking algorithm which is robust against geometric  distortions.  Robustness against geometric attacks is achieved  through text-based image normalization.  First text is extracted from the to-be-marked map, then text orientation and size are exploited  to normalize the image geometry prior to watermark insertion.   Watermarking is performed by means of any of the existing algorithms ensuring good robustness against image processing tools.  At the  decoder side, text is extracted again from the map and used to  normalize image geometry.  Owing to the robustness of text features  with respect to common image manipulations, and to the likely  spreading of text all across the digital map, the proposed system  exhibits an excellent robustness, as it is witnessed by the  experimental results reported in the paper.  6 Refs.

Title: Locating text in color documents
Abstract: In complex color documents, text, drawings and graphics are appeared  with millions of different colors.  In many cases, text regions are  overlaid onto drawings or graphics.  In this paper, a new method is  proposed to automatically detect and extract text in mixed type  color documents.  The proposed method is based on a combination of an Adaptive Color Reduction (ACR) technique and a Page Layout Analysis  (PLA) approach.  The ACR technique is used to obtain the optimal  number of colors.  Then, image is split to separable binary images,  each one corresponding to every principal color.  The PLA technique  is applied independently to each one of the color plains and  identifies the text regions.  A merging procedure is applied in the  final stage to merge the text regions derived from the color plains  and to produce the final document.  10 Refs.

Title: Facial parameter extraction system based on active contours
Abstract: This paper addresses the application of active contours or snakes for location and tracking of facial features.  Conventional snake  approaches find the position of the snake by finding a minimum of  its energy, composed of internal and external forces.  The external  forces pull the contours toward features such as lines and edges.   However, in many applications this minimization leads to contours  that do not represent correctly the feature we are looking for.  We  propose in this paper to introduce some higher level information by  a statistical characterization of the snaxels that should represent  the contour.  This higher level information is introduced in the  selection of candidates in a dynamic programming implementation of  the active contours algorithm, as well as in the external energy.   Furthermore, the same approach is used for tracking the contours  using in this case motion estimation.  10 Refs.

Title: 3D face pose discrimination using wavelets
Abstract: This paper describes a robust method for discriminating 3D face pose  (face orientation) from a video sequence featuring views of a human  head under variable lighting and facial expression conditions.   Wavelet Transform is used to decompose the image into  multi-resolution face images containing both spatial and  spatial-frequency information.  Principal Component analysis (PCA) is used to project a low-resolution sub-band face pose onto a pose  eigen-space where the first 3 eigen coefficients are found most  sensitive to pose and follow a trajectory as the pose changes.  Any  unknown pose of an query image can then be estimated by finding the  Euclidean distance of the first 3 eigen coefficients of the query  image from the estimated trajectory.  Wavelet Transform reduces the  computational load on the PCA and makes the algorithm robust against illumination changes and facial expression.  An accuracy of 84% was  obtained for test images unseen during training under different  environment conditions, facial expressions, and even different human subjects.  21 Refs.

Title: Face detection in colour images
Abstract: This paper describes the development and quantitative assessment of  an approach to face detection (FD), with the application of image  classification in mind.  The approach entitled 'Crude Automatic Face  Extraction' (CAFE), is based on skin colour segmentation, multiple  image representations and multi-resolution scanning.  It is a direct  extension of an approach by Huang [Pattern Recognition  1994] .  Assessment is in terms of false acceptance (FA) and false rejection (FR) scores using a large quantity of  unconstrained typical Internet images, some of which contain faces  and some of which do not.  Skin-based colour segmentation is  introduced as a front-end, along with several additional low-level  image representations, the benefits of which can be seen by a  reduction in the FA score from 74% to 17%.  It is also noted that a  skin probability map can improve FD significantly.  18 Refs.

Title: Face recognition using fisherface algorithm and elastic graph  matching
Abstract: This paper proposes a face recognition technique that effectively  combines elastic graph matching (EGM) and Fisherface algorithm.  EGM  as one of dynamic link architecture uses not only face-shape but  also the gray information of image, and Fisherface algorithm as a  class specific method is robust about variations such as lighting  direction and facial expression.  In the proposed face recognition  adopting the above two methods, the linear projection per node of an image graph reduces dimensionality of labeled graph vector and  provides a feature space to be used effectively for the  classification.  In comparison with a conventional method, the  proposed approach could obtain satisfactory results in the  perspectives of recognition rates and speeds.  Especially, we could  get maximum recognition rate of 99.3% by leaving-one-out method for  the experiments with the Yale Face Databases.  8 Refs.

Title: On the estimation of spectral data: A genetic algorithm approach
Abstract: Spectral data estimation from image data is an ill-posed problem  since (i) due to the integral nature of solid-state light sensors,  the same output can be obtained from an infinity of input signals  and (ii) color signals are spectrally smooth in nature and therefore limit the number of linear independent equations that can be  formulated for the identification problem.  To enable the solution of these problems most methods rely on exact a priori knowledge, such  as smoothness and modality, to formulate hard constraints.  In this  paper a new method based on an extended generalized cross-validation measure is introduced for this type of problems.  The solution is  obtained with a genetic algorithm that maximizes its prediction  ability.  The method does not require exact a priori knowledge on the solution, since it is able to extract this information from the  input data.  11 Refs.

Title: Multiscale color and texture invariants for image recognition
Abstract: This paper proposes a new representation for color texture using a  set of multiscale illuminant invariant features.  The approach was  specifically developed to investigate the feasibility of using  machine vision to automatically monitor populations of animal  species in the Amazon Forest.  The approach uses a combination of  Finlayson's color angle idea and Gabor multichannel filters.  Using a database of color textures from species of Amazonian monkey, and  also a previously published reference database of color regions, we  show that the approach performs better than methods based on color  angles or Gabor filters alone.  The Monkey database was compiled from texture segments extracted from a video of the Amazon Forest using a spatial-temporal segmentation algorithm.  The approach is evaluated  by applying two classification tests in order to measure the quality of the recognition features: Root Mean Square (RMS) analysis and  Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis.  9 Refs.

Title: Finding objects in a 3D environment by combining distance measurement and color indexing
Abstract: In this paper, a new method is presented for the localization and  recognition of three-dimensional objects using color information.  In the first processing step, we estimate depth information by either  applying a chromatic block matching method to color stereo images or acquiring a range image from a laser scanner.  Second, the computed  depth maps are segmented to distinguish between the image background and the objects that should be recognized.  Assuming that the  segmented regions represent single objects in the three-dimensional  scene, feature vectors are generated based on color histograms.  The  Euclidean distance is used as well as the scalar product to measure  the similarity between the feature vectors computed from the color  image and the feature vectors stored in a database.  9 Refs.

Title: Multi-sensor image fusion using multirate filter banks
Abstract: This paper presents a multi-resolution data fusion scheme, based on  multirate image representation.  Motivated by analytical results  obtained from high-resolution multispectral image data analysis: the energy packing the spectral features are distributed in the lower  frequency bands, and the spatial features, edges, are distributed in the higher frequency bands.  This allows to spatially enhancing the  multispectral images, by adding the high-resolution spatial features (extracted from the higher subbands of a panchromatic image) to  them, by a multirate filtering procedure.  This technique finds  application in multi-spectral image interpretation, as well as  medical images of the same part of body obtained by several  different imaging modalities, e.g.  CT images with MRI images.  The  proposed method is compared with some conventional methods.  Results  show it preserves more spectral features with less spatial  distortion.  6 Refs.

Title: Solarspire: Querying temporal solar imagery by content
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a novel content-based retrieval  application which permits astrophysicists to search large image  sequence archives for solar phenomenon, such as solar flares, based  on the spatio-temporal behavior of the solar phenomenon.   Specifically, images are preprocessed to identify bright and dark  spots based on their relative intensity with respect to their  neighboring regions.  Temporally persistent objects are then  extracted from the collection of spots, and their spatio-temporal  behavior represented as intensity and size time series.  Users define a query in terms of a model of spatio-temporal behaviors through a  web-based interface.  The stored intensity and size time series are  searched, and series segments that match the specified specified  spatio-temporal behavior are returned.  The benchmark results based  on 2500 satellite images show that the proposed methodology  demonstrated better than 85% accuracy on a solar phenomenon  previously identified by astrophysicists.  8 Refs.

Title: The constellation matching and its application
Abstract: The constellation matching is a simple but useful image processing  method.  The method makes it possible to recognise the image or the  document by abstracting its essential targets like fixed stars in a  constellation.  The method in this paper is composed of two parts:  (i) the template matching to extract the targets such as the  essential partial parts in the image or the important words in the  document, and (ii) the point pattern matching to examine the  positional or the semantic relationship between those targets.  This  paper firstly describes the mathematical analysis which gives us the relationship between the number of targets and the recognition rate, and that is helpful to estimate the limit of the system ability and  to design system parameters.  Secondly, the application to the  document form identification using keywords detected by character  recognition is discussed.  The evaluation using 139 different  document forms gave us the result of 98% correct identification and  2% rejection rate.  4 Refs.

Title: Improving a genetic algorithm segmentation by means of a fast edge  detection technique
Abstract: This paper presents a new hybrid range image segmentation approach.   Two separate techniques are applied consecutively.  First, an edge  based segmentation technique extracts the edge points-creases and  jumps-contained in the given range image.  Then, by using only the  edge point position information, the boundaries are computed.   Secondly, the points clustered into each region are approximated by  single surfaces through a Genetic Algorithm (GA).  The GA takes  advantage of previous edge representation finding the surface  parameters that best fit each region.  It works in a local way,  according to the boundary information, reducing considerably the  required CPU time.  Experimental results with different range images  are presented; moreover a comparison using either the edge detection stage or not is given.  11 Refs.

Title: Description and retrieval of 3D cellular structures
Abstract: Recent advances in management of multimedia digital libraries enable  effective retrieval of information in the form of audio, image and  video.  Many archives of 3D objects already exist and are expected to grow both in relevance and size.  However, retrieval of information  in the form of 3D objects has received limited attention so far.  In  this paper, we address the problem of effective description and  retrieval of 3D data representing intracellular structures.  These  structures are represented as image stacks, where an image stack is  constituted by a set of 2D images representing sections of a  cellular body at different heights.  In the proposed approach 2D  visual feature descriptors and Hidden Markov Models are combined to  obtain a representation model which is able to distinguish such  intracellular structures as Golgi, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum  and lysosomes.  Preliminary results are presented to show the  effectiveness of the proposed representation model.  17 Refs.

Title: Feature selection method using neural network
Abstract: Feature selection is an important part of the most learning  algorithms.  Feature selection is used to select the most relevant  features from the data.  By selecting only the relevant features of  the data, higher predictive accuracy can be achieved and  computational load of the classification system can be reduced.  In  this paper simply method for the feature selection using  feed-forward neural networks is presented.  Method described here  starts using one input neuron and adds one input at time until  wanted classification accuracy has been achieved or all attributes  have been chosen.  The algorithm can also be used with other  classification methods.  Test results are given and they are  promising.  Our algorithm reduces the size of the feature space  significantly and improves classification accuracy.  Tests were  performed on the commonly used databases.  Average classification  accuracy, when using selected features, was between 79 and 100%  depending on the used dataset.  13 Refs.

Title: Recording the region of interest from flycam panoramic video
Abstract: A novel method for region of interest tracking and recording video is presented.  The proposed method is based on the FlyCam system left  bracket 4] , which produces high resolution and  wide-angle video sequences by stitching the video frames from  multiple stationary cameras.  The method integrates tracking and  recording processes, and targets applications such as classroom  lectures and video conferencing.  First, the region of interest  (which typically covers the speaker) is tracked using a Kalman  filter.  Then, the Kalman filter estimation results are used for  virtual camera control and to record the video.  The system has no  physical camera motion and the virtual camera parameters are readily available for video indexing.  The proposed system has been  implemented for real time recording of lectures and presentations.   10 Refs.

Title: Evaluation of textural feature extraction schemes for neural  network-based interpretation of regions in medical images
Abstract: A few approaches have been presented in the literature towards the  discrimination of texture in medical images.  Recently, medical  experts proposed that the more valuable information for  discriminating among normal and suspicious for cancer regions in  endoscopic images is the texture of the examined tissue.  Texture can be encoded by a number of mathematical descriptors.  Three well-known textural descriptors, as well as a new wavelet-based one are used in this paper for an accurate study and evaluation of the methodologies encountered.  Experiments conducted include tests with various images from the Brodatz album, as well as interpretation of tissue regions  in endoscopic image.  In all cases the recognition task is supported  by multilayer perceptron type neural network architectures.  8 Refs.

Title: Real-time active shape models for face segmentation
Abstract: In this work we tackle the problem of real-time alignment of active  shape models to new object instances at video frame rate.  To achieve this we use edge orientation information as basic image feature.   Unlike in the original active shape framework we incorporate the  image features directly into the model vector.  We also introduce a  new update rule for a model point in a local surrounding.  We  demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with a face  segmentation task.  There we are able to fit a new model face on  average within 20 msec on 500 MHz Pentium II PC if the initial model position and size does not deviate too much from the true position.   The latter is assured by a face detection step which is carried out  before the active shape alignment.  10 Refs.

Title: Automated spatiotemporal scaling for video generalization
Abstract: In this paper we present a technique for the summarization and  spatiotemporal scaling of video content.  A Self Organizing Map (SOM) neural network can be used or acquire a rough generalization of the  spatiotemporal trajectories of moving objects, in the form of few  selected nodes along these trajectories.  We introduce a hybrid  technique, combining SOM with geometric analysis to properly densify these nodes, to better represent the spatiotemporal behavior of  objects.  This allows us to bypass problems inherently associated  with parameter selection in SOM.  We also demonstrate how  spatio-temporal scaling supports the analysis of behavioral  patterns.  The paper shows that our novel technique is a powerful  tool for the extraction of generalized information from complex  trajectories, displaying high invariance to noise and information  gaps in the video stream.  Experimental results demonstrate the  accuracy potential of our generalization technique.  11 Refs.

Title: Active contour segmentation guided by AM-FM dominant component  analysis
Abstract: For the first time, we explore the application of active contours in  the modulation domain by computing snakes on image modulations.  As  we demonstrate in the examples, such snakes are able to utilize  information inherent in the dominant image modulations to acquire  and track visually and semantically meaningful structures within the image.  We use nonlinear AM-FM image representations to capture  regions that are homogeneous in intensity and in texture.  A  geometric snake approach utilizing a fuzzy classifier is then  applied to the image modulations.  The combination of AM-FM analysis  and the active contour evolution produces an efficacious image  partition.  As a preliminary demonstration of this novel approach, we apply the modulation domain snakes to the classical texture  segmentation problem.  12 Refs.

Title: Image segmentation using local spectral histograms
Abstract: We propose a new algorithm for image segmentation.  We use spectral  histogram, which is a vector consisting of marginal distributions of responses from chosen filters as a generic feature for texture as  well as intensity images.  Motivated by a new segmentation energy  functional, we derive an iterative and deterministic approximation  algorithm for segmentation.  Based on the relationships between  different scales and neighboring windows, we also develop an  algorithm which can automatically detect homogeneous regions in an  input image, which may consist of texture regions.  To reduce the  boundary uncertainty due to the large spatial window used for  spectral histograms, we propose a novel local feature by building  precise probability models based on current segmentation results.  We have applied our algorithm to intensity, texture, and natural images and obtained good results with accurate texture boundaries.  7 Refs.

Title: A novel technique for unsupervised texture segmentation
Abstract: Image texture segmentation is an important problem and occurs  frequently in many image processing applications.  Although, a number of algorithms exist in the literature.  Methods that rely on the use  of Expectation-Maximisation algorithm are gaining a growing  interest.  The main feature of this algorithm is that it is capable  of estimating the parameters of mixture distribution.  This paper  presents a novel unsupervised algorithm based on  Expectation-Maximisation algorithm where the analysis is applied on  vector data rather than the grey level.  This is achieved by defining a likelihood function witch measures how the estimated features are  fitting the present data.  Experimental results on images containing  various synthetic and natural textures have been carried out and a  comparison with existing and similar techniques has shown the  superiority of the proposed method.  10 Refs.

Title: Fuzzy rule extraction from ID3-type decision trees for real data
Abstract: This paper proposes a method to construct a fuzzy rule-based  classifier system from an ID3-type decision tree (DT) for real data.  The three major steps are rule extraction, gradient descent tuning  of the rule-base, and performance-based pruning of the rule-base.   Pruning removes all rules which cannot meet a certain level of  performance.  To test our scheme, we have used the DT generated by  RID3, an ID3-type classifier for real data.  In this process, we made some improvements of RID3 to get a tree with less redundancy and  hence a smaller rule-base.  The rule-base is tested on several data  sets and is found to demonstrate an excellent performance.  Results  obtained by the proposed scheme are consistently better than C4.5  across several data sets.  43 Refs.

Title: Visual inspection of sea bottom structures by an autonomous  underwater vehicle
Abstract: This paper describes a vision-based system for inspections of  underwater structures, e.g., pipelines, cables, etc., by an  autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV).  Usually, underwater inspections are performed by remote operated vehicles (ROVs) driven by human  operators placed in a support vessel.  However, this task is often  challenging, especially in conditions of poor visibility or in  presence of strong currents.  The system proposed allows the AUV to  accomplish the task in autonomy.  Moreover, the use of a  three-dimensional (3-D) model of the environment and of an extended  Kalman filter (EKF) allows the guidance and the control of the  vehicle in real time.  Experiments done on real underwater images  have demonstrated the validity of the proposed method and its  efficiency in the case of critical and complex situations.  27 Refs.

Title: Font recognition based on global texture analysis
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a novel texture-analysis-based approach  toward font recognition.  Existing methods are typically based on  local typographical features that often require connected components analysis.  In our method, we take the document as an image containing some specific textures and regard font recognition as texture  identification.  The method is content-independent and involves no  detailed local feature analysis.  Experiments are carried out by  using 14,000 samples of 24 frequently used Chinese fonts (six  typefaces combined with four styles), as well as 32 frequently used  English fonts (eight typefaces combined with four styles).  An  average recognition rate of 99.1 percent is achieved.  Experimental  results are also included on the robustness of the method against  image degradation (e.g., Pepper and Salt noise) and on the  comparison with existing methods.  17 Refs.

Title: Simulating decorative mosaics
Abstract: This paper presents a method for simulating decorative tile mosaics.   Such mosaics are challenging because the square tiles that comprise  them must be packed tightly and yet must follow orientations chosen  by the artist.  Based on an existing image and user-selected edge  features, the method can both reproduce the image's colours and  emphasize the selected edges by placing tiles that follow the edges.  The method uses centroidal voronoi diagrams which normally arrange  points in regular hexagonal grids.  By measuring distances with an  manhattan metric whose main axis is adjusted locally to follow the  chosen direction field, the centroidal diagram can be adapted to  place tiles in curving square grids instead.  Computing the  centroidal voronoi diagram is made possible by leveraging the  z-buffer algorithm available in many graphics cards.  13 Refs.

Title: Volume-based three-dimensional metamorphosis using sphere-guided  region correspondence
Abstract: The metamorphosis of one image into another has frequently been used  to create impressive visual effects.  Three-dimensional surface  metamorphosis extends this paradigm by interpolating between  discrete volume representations of the surfaces.  The insensitivity  of the established techniques to the surface topology enables  morphing between completely different surfaces: however it can also  lead to intermediate surfaces which have different topology from the originals.  We present a method which improves on this situation by  ensuring that no part of each surface remains disconnected during  the morph.  The morph is guided by region correspondence, derived  automatically from a sphere representation of each surface: this can be combined with manual correspondence to retain user control over  the morph.  What emerges is a fast and flexible method for morphing  surfaces, as demonstrated on several examples.  31 Refs.

Title: Feature extraction of fault currents associated with multi-shot  reclosing scheme in power distribution system
Abstract: This paper presents the feature extraction of fault currents that are associated with temporary and permanent faults in a distribution  system employing a multi-shot reclosing scheme.  In order to extract  particular features of the temporary and permanent faults, we  utilized the root mean square (RMS) and total harmonic distortion  (THD) information that can be simply and conveniently implemented in digital relay.  From this we found that temporary faults are normally greater in comparison to permanent faults in the variation of RMS  and THD.  The results of this paper could be effectively utilized for implementing an adaptive reclosing scheme that could discriminate  between temporary and permanent faults in power distribution  systems. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: Raman spectroscopy and genetic algorithms for the classification of  wood types
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy and pattern recognition techniques are used to  develop a potential method to characterize wood by type.  The test  data consists of 98 Raman spectra of temperature softwoods and  hardwoods, and Brazilian and Honduran tropical woods.  A genetic  algorithm (GA) is used to extract features (i.e., line intensities  at specific wavelengths) characteristic of the Raman profile of each wood-type.  The spectral features identified by the pattern  recognition GA allow the wood samples to cluster by type in a plot  of the two largest principal components of the data.  Because  principal components maximize variance, the bulk of the information  encoded by these spectral features is about differences between wood types.  The predictive ability of the descriptors identified by the  pattern recognition GA and the principal component map associated  with them is validated using an external prediction set consisting  of tropical woods and temperate hard and softwoods.  22 Refs.

Title: A new feature vector using selected bispectra for signal  classification with application in radar target recognition
Abstract: Radially integrated bispectra (RIB), axially integrated bispectra  (AIB), and circularly integrated bispectra (CIB) were used as  feature vectors of signals, but many bispectra on integration paths  may be redundant, and some bispectra are even baneful for signal  classification.  To avoid these problems, this paper proposes using  selected bispectra with the maximum interclass separability as  feature vectors of signals.  In radar target recognition, range  profiles are suitable feature vectors, but they have two main  shortcomings: sensitivity to time shift and aspect dependence.  Since the selected bispectra of range profiles are translation invariant  and can avoid redundant and baneful bispectra as features, they are  thus especially suitable for radar target recognition, which is  shown by experiments.  16 Refs.

Title: A condensed representation to find frequent patterns
Abstract: Given a large set of data, a common data mining problem is to extract the frequent patterns occurring in this set.  The idea presented in  this paper is to extract a condensed representation of the frequent  patterns called disjunction-free sets, instead of extracting the  whole frequent pattern collection.  We show that this condensed  representation can be used to regenerate all frequent patterns and  their exact frequencies.  Moreover, this regeneration can be  performed without any access to the original data.  Practical  experiments show that this representation can be extracted very  efficiently even in difficult cases.  We compared it with another  representation of frequent patterns previously investigated in the  literature called frequent closed sets.  In nearly all experiments we have run, the disjunction-free sets have been extracted much more  efficiently than frequent closed sets.  11 Refs.

Title: Automatic adjustment of invalid feature models
Abstract: In current feature modeling systems, all dimensions in a model have  to be fully specified by the user.  It is desirable that systems  become more flexible in this respect, i.e. that non-critical  dimensions in a model can be declared as variant, and that the model can be automatically adjusted when this is appropriate.  A method and an implementation to realize this will be described.  The underlying  feature model definition and validation approach will be introduced.  Validation is done by a collection of constraint solvers.  An  overview of invalid situations in which automatic model adjustment  can be applied will be given.  The constraint solving scheme and, in  particular, the automatic model adjustment strategies for different  types of constraints will be elaborated.  Applications in the areas  of design by features, creating a member from a family of products,  and feature conversion will be given.  These will illustrate that  automatic feature model adjustment is a very useful concept.  14  Refs.

Title: A silhouette based technique for the reconstruction of human movement
Abstract: A number of promising applications have renewed researchers' interest in the analysis of human movements.  In general, motion capture could play an important role in many areas that require storing,  analyzing, or reproducing the motion of human beings.  Current motion capture techniques are based on intrusive sensory systems, which  might be disturbing or impossible to apply in several application  areas.  In this paper we present a novel non-intrusive technique able to reconstruct unconstrained motion.  From multiple-viewpoint images  taken with an ordinary camera a 3D reconstruction is computed with a technique known as volume intersection.  Motion data are acquired by  fitting a model of the performer to the reconstructed volume.  Data  about the reconstruction accuracy achievable with our technique in a virtual environment are also provided.  20 Refs.

Title: Construction of feature volumes using intersection of adjacent  surfaces
Abstract: An algorithm is presented for the construction of feature volumes  using the topology and geometry found in the 3D boundary  representation of a solid object.  The concavity of faces, edges and  vertices is used to detect features and any interactions between  them.  Faces adjacent to the feature faces are intersected to create  new edges which can be used to create totally new construction  faces.  These construction faces are then used to complete the  feature volume.  Simple rules have been developed which allow the  intersection of quadric surfaces.  This algorithm is modular in  nature and can be used in conjunction with any feature detection  module.  The basic principle is established using the simplest of  examples.  The technique is then tested on several benchmark parts  taken from the NIST design repository.  (Author abstract) 30 Refs.

Title: Bandpass filter-based approach to crop row location and tracking
Abstract: A method of locating crop rows in image sequences is described.   Unlike several previously reported algorithms, the method does not  rely upon the segmentation of plant material from the background on  the basis of absolute brightness or colour.  Rather, the periodic  amplitude variation due to parallel crop rows is exploited.  Given  the geometry of the camera arrangement and the crop row spacing, a  filter is derived which allows the crop rows to be extracted whilst  attenuating the effects of partial shadowing and spurious features  such as weeds.  The position and orientation of the rows are tracked  using an extended Kalman filter.  The method has been used to guide a mechanical hoe in winter wheat with an RMS positional error of 15.6  mm at a speed of 1.6 ms**-**1, despite the presence of complex  shadows cast by the tractor in the imaged area.

Title: Visualization of time-dependent data with feature tracking and event  detection
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative method to analyze and visualize  time-dependent evolution of features.  The analysis and visualization of time-dependent data are complicated because of the immense number of data involved.  However, if the scientist's main interest is the  evolution of certain features, it suffices to show the evolution of  these features.  The task of the visualization method is to extract  the features from all frames, to determine the correspondences  between features in successive frames, to detect significant events  or stages in the evolution of the features, and, finally, to  visualize the results.  The method described here performs all these  steps, and it is applied to a number of applications.  (Author  abstract) 20 Refs.

Title: Applying the eigenfaces and Fisherfaces methods to circuit-board  inspection
Abstract: This paper presents the application of two face recognition  techniques to a manufacturing recognition problem, the detection of  the presence of surface-mounted devices on printed circuit boards.   Without assuming that the region of interest (ROI) is well framed, a preprocessing stage is developed to find and extract this subimage  from a larger image using a series of image-processing steps.  The  eigenfaces and Fisherfaces feature extraction methods are then  applied to the ROIs in order to project them onto lower-dimensional, optimal feature subspaces in which the classification is done.  An  important part of the work presented is the evaluation and selection of most discriminating eigenimage feature projections to use in  classification.  Experimental results on a testing database of 37,000 images yields 87% to 94% correct-classification rates for both  feature extraction strategies.  (Author abstract) 24 Refs.

Title: Fabric defect segmentation using multichannel blob detectors
Abstract: The problem of automated defect detection in textured materials is  investigated.  A new algorithm based on multichannel filtering is  presented.  The texture features are extracted by filtering the  acquired image using a filter bank consisting of a number of real  Gabor functions, with multiple narrow spatial frequency and  orientation channels.  For each image, we propose the use of image  fusion to multiplex the information from sixteen different channels  obtained in four orientations.  Adaptive degrees of thresholding and  the associated effect on sensitivity to material impurities are  discussed.  This algorithm realizes large computational savings over  the previous approaches and enables high-quality real-time defect  detection.  The performance of this algorithm has been tested  thoroughly on real fabric defects, and experimental results have  confirmed the usefulness of the approach.  (Author abstract) 45 Refs.

Title: Abstraction on clinical data sequences: An object-oriented data model and a query language based on the event calculus
Abstract: In this work, we deal with temporal abstraction of clinical data.   Abstractions are, for example, blood pressure state (e.g. normal,  high, low) and trend (e.g. increasing, decreasing and stationary)  over time intervals.  The goal of our work is to provide clinicians  with automatic tools to extract high-level, concise, important  features of available collections of time-stamped clinical data.   This capability is especially important when the available  collections constantly increase in size, as in long-term clinical  follow-up, leading to information overload.  The approach we propose  exploits the integration of the deductive and object-oriented  approaches in clinical databases.  The main result of this work is an object-oriented data model based on the event calculus to support  temporal abstraction.  The proposed approach has been validated  building the CARDIOTABS system for the abstraction of clinical data  collected during echocardiographic tests.  (Author abstract) 34 Refs.

Title: Least-commitment graph matching with genetic algorithms
Abstract: This paper concerns the correspondence matching of ambiguous feature  sets extracted images.  The first contribution made in this paper is  to extend Wilson and Hancock's Bayesian matching framework (Wilson  and Hancock, IEEE Trans.  Pattern Anal.  Mach.  Intell.  19 (1997)  634-648) by considering the case where the feature measurements are  ambiguous.  The second contribution is the development of a  multimodal evolutionary optimisation framework which is capable to  simultaneously producing several good alternative solutions.   Previous multimodal genetic algorithms have required additional  parameters to be added to a method which is already  over-parameterised.  The algorithm presented in this paper requires  no extra parameters: solution yields are maximised by removing bias  in the selection step, while optimisation performance is maintained  by a local search step.  This framework is in principle applicable to any multimodal optimisation problem where local search performs  well.  An experimental study demonstrates the effectiveness of the  new approach on synthetic and real data.  (Author abstract) 64 Refs.

Title: Reconstruction of broken handwritten digits based on structural  morphological features
Abstract: In this paper, a new method of reconstructing broken handwritten  digits is developed.  The conditional dilation algorithm is used to  bridge small gaps.  Spurious segments introduced during extraction of digit fields are detected and deleted based on the morphological  structural analyses of digit fields.  A set of structural points of  digits are detected along the outer contours of digits.  The  preselected broken points of the digits are determined based on the  minimum distance between two structural points.  The correction rules of the preselected broken points are based on the structural  morphological analyses and the stroke extension.  The reconstruction  and recognition of handwritten internally broken digits are also  discussed.  Experimental results are given showing the effectiveness  of the method.  (Author abstract) 12 Refs.

Title: Similarity retrieval of occluded shapes using wavelet-based shape  features
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach for describing and  estimating similarity of shapes.  The target application is  content-based indexing and retrieval over large image databases.  The shape feature vector is based on the efficient indexing of high  curvature (HCP) points which are detected at different levels of  resolution of the wavelet transform modulus maxima decomposition.   The scale information, together with other topological information  of those high curvature points are employed in a sophisticated  similarity algorithm.  The experimental results and comparisons show  that the technique isolates efficiently similar shapes from a large  database and reflects adequately the human similarity perception.   The proposed algorithm also proved efficient in matching heavily  occluded contours with their originals and with other shape contours in the database containing similar portions.

Title: Fast object detection and segmentation in MPEG compressed domain
Abstract: In this paper, we present a fast algorithm for object detection and  segmentation in MPEG compressed domain using color clustering,  region merging based on spatiotemporal similarities,  background/foreground classification, and pixel edge extraction.  The features extracted from the blocks of segmented object in compressed domain can be used for fast object tracking and indexing at low  level.  Moreover, these blocks can be decompressed to obtain details  of a specific object in pixel domain and can be used for high level  indexing.  By using the proposed algorithm, we can reduce the amount  of the information needed to be processed, and therefore, save the  computational time, and increase the processing speed.  Also we need  to perform inverse DCT on only some parts of the image.  (Author  abstract) 13 Refs.

Title: New primitives to reduce the effect of noise for handwritten features extraction
Abstract: A method for feature extraction for handwritten OCR system is  presented.  In order to reduce the effect of the noise which is  either an original noise or obtained as a result of the  preprocessing stages, there is a need to develop a feature  extraction method invariant to the expected distortions, and less  dependent on the locations of high probable appearance of noise and  distortion.  This method depends only on the two primitive features:  straight lines and curves.  A chain code has been built from the  thinned shape of the character.  Two rules have been introduced to  cut this chain code into small segments.  From each segment one  feature is defined and for each input character, a feature vector  will be built.  The prototype system was tested for alphanumeric  characters and the results were satisfactory.  (Author abstract) 9  Refs.

Title: Automatic eye detection using intensity and edge information
Abstract: In this paper we propose a new algorithm to detect the pupils of both eyes from a human face in an intensity image.  First, feature points  which are the candidates for the pupils of both eyes are extracted  from the face image by using the feature template proposed by Lin  and Wu.  Next, the proposed algorithm computes a cost for each pair  of feature points satisfying a spatial constraint.  The cost is  computed by searching for a circular region corresponding to the  iris around each feature point.  Finally, the algorithm determines a  pair of feature points with the smallest cost to be the pupils of  both eyes.  As the result of the experiment using all faces without  spectacles in the face database of the University of Bern, the  success rate of the proposed algorithm was 93.0 [%] on the average.  And, if looking-down faces are excluded, the success rate of the proposed algorithm was 97.1 [%] on the average.  (Author abstract) 14 Refs.

Title: Capacitive fingerprint sensor chip for automatic matching
Abstract: This paper examines the implementation of high-resolution fingerprint sensor chip.  The chip is composed of 256 multiplied by 256 sensing  cells.  Using this integrated sensor, the fingerprint is captured by  pressing the finger skin onto the chip surface.  Capacitive sensors  that detect the electric field variation induced by the skin surface sample the fingerprint pattern.  Automatic Finger Print  Identification System (AFIS) compares fingerprint based on their  differences and similarities of ridge ending and bifurcation.  The  efficiency is reduced if the database is too large.  Partitioning of  finger print on the basis of classification of print into basic  patterns known as loop, arch, whirl, and scar is adopted.  Once the  class of each incoming print has been determined, the set of  possible matching print in the data base can be restricted thereby  reducing the number of comparisons that must be performed.

Title: Random cascades on wavelet trees and their use in analyzing and  modeling natural images
Abstract: We develop a new class of non-Gaussian multiscale stochastic  processes defined by random cascades on trees of wavelet or other  multiresolution coefficients.  These cascades reproduce a rich  semi-parametric class of random variables known as Gaussian scale  mixtures.  We demonstrate that this model class can accurately  capture the remarkably regular and non-Gaussian features of natural  images in a parsimonious fashion, involving only a small set of  parameters.  In addition, this model structure leads to efficient  algorithms for image processing.  In particular, we develop a  Newton-like algorithm for MAP estimation that exploits very fast  algorithms for linear-Gaussian estimation on trees, and hence is  efficient.  On the basis of this MAP estimator, we develop and  illustrate a denoising technique that is based on a global prior  model, and preserves the structure of natural images (e.g., edges).

Title: Dyadic frames of directional wavelets as texture descriptors
Abstract: We propose a wavelet-based texture classification system.  Texture  descriptors are local energy measures within the feature images  obtained by projecting the samples on Dyadic Frames of Directional  Wavelets.  Rotation invariant features are obtained by taking the  Fourier expansion of the subsets of components of the original  feature vectors concerning each considered scale (or resolution)  separately.  Three different classification schemes have been  compared: the Euclidean, the weighted Euclidean and the KNN  classifiers.  Performances have been evaluated on a set of 13 Brodatz textures, from which both a training set and a test set have been  extracted.  Results are presented in the form of confusion matrices.   The KNN classifier provides the globally best performance, with an  average recognition rate around the 96% for the original non-rotated test set, and 88% when the rotated versions are considered.  Its  simplicity and accuracy renders the proposed method highly suited  for multimedia applications, as content-based image retrieval.   (Author abstract) 26 Refs.

Title: An illumination effect descriptor for video sequences
Abstract: In the context of indexing of video data bases, the future standard  MPEG-7 will provide descriptors for motion, shape, texture, and  color to identify video scenes.  In this paper, an illumination  effect descriptor is presented that has been proposed to MPEG-7.   Effects caused by scene illumination can be a useful feature for  video indexing.  The proposed descriptor addresses temporal changes  of object shading, of cast shadows, and of the global illumination  intensity by one scalar.  It is based on temporal changes of image  luminance along motion trajectories.  Further, an automatic, noise  adaptive method for extraction of the illumination effect descriptor from a video sequence is presented.  Performance analysis and sample  retrieval experiments show that extracted descriptor values are  sufficiently precise and sensible to distinguish video sequences  with different scene illumination.  36 Refs.

Title: Multiple neural network with genetic algorithm for critical pattern  recognition of trace quantity gas
Abstract: Critical pattern recognition of trace gas by multiple neural network  with genetic algorithm is presented.  The trace gas concentration was measured by the above method, for example, 1-70 parts per million by volume of hydrogen, or acetylene or ethene, or 50-550 parts per  million of carbon monoxide.  The single network can recognize gas  species in large range, but cannot acquire the precise output at  critical value.  Since the concentration threshold of failure  characteristic gas in transformer oil is very important to early  failure diagnosis, the measurement precision of it should be  improved.  A new method of multiple neural network with genetic  algorithm is presented, which can keep the recognition range but  also improve the precision.  (Edited abstract) 4 Refs.

Title: Sensores virtuales basados en redes neurales   Virtual sensors based on neural networks
Abstract: In recent years, neural networks have been extensively used to model  complex nonlinear chemical processes.  This article studies their  application in the development of virtual (software) sensors for  product quality prediction.  These sensors use, for the training and  validation, information extracted from historical process  operational databases.  A method is proposed to select, out of the  whole set of available measured process variables, an appropriate  subset used as input to the software sensor.  This method, based on  principal component analysis and information theoric tests helps to  discard redundant, superfluous and collinear variables, while  keeping those that explain most of the variations of the sensors's  output.  To show an application of these procedures, product quality  sensors for a refinery distillation unit are developed using  operational process data.  15 Refs.

Title: Detecting landmines using weighted density distribution function  features
Abstract: Land mine detection using metal detector (MD) and ground penetrating  radar (GPR) sensors in hand-held units is a difficult problem.   Detection difficulties arise due to: 1) the varying composition and  type of metal in land mines, 2) the time-varying nature of  background and 3) the variation in height and velocity of the  hand-held unit in data measurement.  This research introduces new  spatially distributed MD features for differentiating land mine  signatures from background.  The spatially distributed features  involve correlating sequences of MD energy values with six weighted  density distribution functions.  These features are evaluated using a standard back propagation neural network on real data sets  containing more than 2,300 mine encounters of different size, shape, content and metal composition that are measured under different soil conditions.  12 Refs.

Title: Non-linear relevance feedback: Improving the performance of  content-based retrieval systems
Abstract: In this paper, a non-linear relevance feedback mechanism is proposed  for increasing the performance and the reliability of content-based  retrieval systems.  In particular, the human is considered as part of the retrieval process in an interactive framework, who evaluates the results provided by the system so that the system automatically  updated its performance based on the users' feedback.  An adaptively  trained neural network architecture is used for implementing the  non-linear feedback.  The weight adaptation is performed in such a  way that the network output satisfies the users' selection as much  as possible, while simultaneously providing a minimal degradation  over all previous data.  Experimental results indicates that the  proposed method yields better performance compared to linear  relevance feedback mechanism.  10 Refs.

Title: A new artificial neural network controller for an interior permanent  magnet motor drive
Abstract: This paper presents a novel dynamic artificial neural network (ANN)  controller for accurate speed control of interior permanent magnet  synchronous motor (IPMSM) under system uncertainties.  A field  oriented IPMSM model is used to decouple the flux and torque  components of the motor dynamics.  The initial estimation of  coefficients of the proposed ANN speed controller is obtained by  off-line training method.  On-line training has been carried out to  update the ANN under continuous mode of operation.  Dynamic  back-propagation (BP) with Levenburg-Marquardt algorithm (LM) is  utilized for online training purpose.  The simulation and  experimental results reveal that the control architecture adapts and generalizes its learning to a wide range of operating conditions and provides promising results under parameter variations and load  changes.  22 Refs.

Title: Dual heuristic programming excitation neurocontrol for generators in  a multimachine power system
Abstract: The design of optimal neurocontrollers that replace the conventional  automatic voltage regulators for excitation control of  turbogenerators in a multimachine power system is presented in this  paper.  The neurocontroller design is based on Dual Heuristic  Programming (DHP), a powerful adaptive critic technique.  The  feedback variables are completely based on local measurements from  the generators.  Simulations on a three-machine power system  demonstrate that DHP based neurocontrol is much more effective than  the conventional PID control for improving dynamic performance and  stability of the power grid under small and large disturbances.  This paper also shows how to design optimal multiple neurocontrollers for nonlinear systems, such as power systems, without having to do  continually online training of the neural networks, thus avoiding  risks of instability.  12 Refs.

Title: Identification of surface defects in textured materials using wavelet packets
Abstract: This paper investigates a new approach for the detection of surface  defects, in textured materials, using wavelet packets.  Every  inspection image is decomposed with a family of real orthonormal  wavelet bases.  The wavelet packet coefficients from a set of  dominant frequency channels containing significant information are  used for the characterization of textured images.  A fixed number of  shift invariant measures from the wavelet packet coefficients are  computed.  The magnitude and position of these shift invariant  measures in a quadtree representation forms the feature set for a  two-layer neural network classifier.  The neural net classifier  classifies these feature vectors into either of defect or  defect-free classes.  The experimental results suggest that this  proposed scheme can successfully identify the defects, and can be  used for automated visual inspection.  9 Refs.

Title: Analysis of cache memory strategies for some image processing  applications
Abstract: Neural networks and image processing algorithms typically use very  large amounts of data and usually this data is processed  iteratively.  Hence, the issue of cache memories for enhancing the  processing speed is important.  A particularly important model that  fits these applications is the simple loop model.  Here, the exact  solution for the cache memory simple loop model under random  replacement is given using an urn model and the theory of Markov  Chains.  The probability distribution is obtained as a quotient of  Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind.  It is also shown that  asymptotically the number of elements in the urns follows a  Truncated at Zero Poisson Distribution.  9 Refs.

Abstract: Face recognition has established itself as an important sub-branch of pattern recognition within the field of computer science.  Many  state-of-the-art systems have focused on the task of recognizing  frontal views of people.  In this work we will present an approach to recognize profile views (90 degree ) with a system trained on  transformed frontal views.  The system combines an Artificial Neural  Network (ANN) and a classification process based on Hidden Markov  Models (HMM).  One of the main ideas of this system is to perform the recognition task without the use of any 3D-information of heads and  faces.

Abstract: A variety of color correction technologies have been applied for the  hardcopies to eliminate the cross talks caused by unwanted  absorption in colorants.  However, since the accuracy of color  correction is not sufficient, the improvement of the color  correction technology is required as aspect of the appearance of  color devices.  This paper proposes a new color correction method  combining neural networks with genetic algorithms.  An evaluation  experiment of RMS color difference has been done by the chart  pattern of 1331 colors inside the printer color gamut.  As a result,  it has shown that a proposal method is qualitatively and  quantitatively superior to the conventional color correction masking method using least square method.  5 Refs.

Title: Adaptive edge enhancement in SAR images. Training on the data vs.  training on simulated data
Abstract: Edge detection and edge enhancement in SAR images is, due to the  speckle effect, not so easily achieved.  Here we consider edge  enhancement as classification problem, i.e. we segment an image in  several edge classes and a no edge class.  Thus supervised  classification techniques become available.  We proposed an  artificial neural network approach and interpret the output as  'grade of being an edge pixel'.  For training of the network we  applied two training strategies: 1. Selection of training samples  from the data in a supervised way and 2. Artificial creation of  training samples based on speckle statistics using a speckle  simulation algorithm.  Both strategies are applied on a data set  acquired by DLR's E-SAR in L-Band.  The outputs of the edge  enhancement process are compared among each other and with RoA edge  detector.  6 Refs.

The  system uses the HAusdorff-Voronoi NETwork (HAVNET), as artificial  neural network designed for two-dimensional binary pattern  recognition.  A detailed review of the architecture, the learning  equations, and the recognition equations for the HAVNET network are  presented.  Competitive learning has been implemented in training the network using a nearest-neighbor technique.  The image identification system presented in this paper is applied to two tasks: the optical  recognition of a set of American sign language signals and  identification of grayscale fingerprints.  Image preprocessing  includes edge enhancement by histogram equalization, application of  a Laplacian filter and thresholding.  A segmented Hankel and Fourier  transformation in polar coordinates is applied to the binary image  giving a rotationally and translationally invariant image structure.  This preprocessed image employs the HAVNET neural network for  successful image identification.  12 Refs.

Title: Neural network approach for modelling ammonia emission after manure  application on the field
Abstract: This paper presents a neural network approach, which enables one to  simulate ammonia emission after manure application on the field.   Based on the data from 227 experiments out of previously published  research, it can be illustrated that the time course of accumulated  ammonia emission follows a non-linear Michaelis-Menten-like  function.  This function is determined by the two parameters  E//m//a//x and K//M, which are dependent on manure-specific driving  forces, application parameters and climate.  102 data sets of the 227 experiments showed sufficient data for training and validating  neural networks for estimating E//m//a//x and K//M.  The neural  networks could be trained to R**2 values of 0.926 and 0.832 for the  training set and the validation set of E//m//a//x, and to R**2  values of 0.988 for the training set and 0.527 for the validation  set of the K//M-value, respectively.

Title: A neural network model on self-organizing emergence of simple-cell  receptive field with orientation selectivity in visual cortex
Abstract: In order to probe into the self-organizing emergence of simple cell  orientation selectivity, we tried to construct a neural network  model that consists of LGN neurons and simple cells in visual cortex and obeys the Hebbian learning rule.  We investigated the neural  coding and representation of simple cells to a natural image by  means of this model.  The results show that the structures of their  receptive fields are determined by the preferred orientation  selectivity of simple cells.  However, they are also decided by the  emergence of self-organization in the unsupervision learning  process.  This kind of orientation selectivity results from dynamic  self-organization based on the interactions between LGN and cortex.   17 Refs.

Title: The double queue method: A numerical method for integrate-and-fire  neuron networks
Abstract: Numerical methods for initial-value problems based on  finite-differencing of differential equations (FDM) are not well  suited for the simulation of an integrate-and-fire neuron network  (IFNN) due to the discontinuities implied by the firing condition of the neurons.  The Double Queue Method (DQM) is an event-queue based  numerical method designed for the simulation of an IFNN that can  deal with such discontinuities properly.  In the DQM, the states of  individual neurons at the next predicted discontinuous points are  determined by an analytic solution, meaning an optimal performance  in both accuracy and speed.  A comparison study with the FDM  demonstrates the superiority of the DQM, and provides some examples  where the FDM gives inaccurate results that can possibly lead to a  false conclusion about the dynamics of an IFNN. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science Ltd.

Abstract: Neurons are subject to internal and external noise that have been  known to modify the way they process incoming signals.  Recent  studies have suggested that such alterations have functional roles  and can also be used in biomedical applications.  The present work  goes over experimental and theoretical descriptions of the response  of neurons to white noise stimulation.  It examines various forms of  noise related behavior in a standard neuronal model, namely the  leaky integrate and fire.  This clarifies the conditions under which  specific noise induced changes occur in neurons, and consequently  can help in determining whether nervous systems operate under  similar circumstances. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: Resonate-and-fire neurons
Abstract: We suggest a simple spiking model - resonate-and-fire neuron, which  is similar to the integrate-and-fire neuron except that the state  variable is complex.  The model provides geometric illustrations to  many interesting phenomena occurring in biological neurons having  subthreshold damped oscillations of membrane potential.  For example, such neurons prefer a certain resonant frequency of the input that  is nearly equal to their eigenfrequency, they can be excited or  inhibited by a doublet (two pulses) depending on its interspike  interval, and they can fire in response to an inhibitory input.  All  these properties could be observed in Hodgkin-Huxley-type models.  We use the resonate-and-fire model to illustrate possible sensitivity  of biological neurons to the fine temporal structure of the input  spike train.  Being an analogue of the integrate-and-fire model, the  resonate-and-fire model is computationally efficient and suitable  for simulations of large networks of spiking neurons. copy 2001  Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: Distributed synchrony in a cell assembly of spiking neurons
Abstract: We investigate the formation of a Hebbian cell assembly of spiking  neurons, using a temporal synaptic learning curve that is based on  recent experimental findings.  It includes potentiation for short  time delays between pre- and post-synaptic neuronal spiking, and  depression for spiking events occurring in the reverse order.  The  coupling between the dynamics of synaptic learning and that of  neuronal activation leads to interesting results.  One possible mode  of activity is distributed synchrony, implying spontaneous division  of the Hebbian cell assembly into groups, or subassemblies, of cells that fire in a cyclic manner.  The behavior of distributed synchrony  is investigated both by simulations and by analytic calculations of  the resulting synaptic distributions. copy 2001 Elsevier Science  Ltd.

Title: ON-OFF retinal ganglion cells temporally encode OFF/ON sequence
Abstract: While the functions of ON and OFF retinal ganglion cells have been  intensively investigated, that of ON-OFF cells has not.  In the  present study, the temporal properties of spike trains emitted from  ON-OFF cells in response to randomly flickering or multiphase ramp  stimuli were examined in the Japanese quail.  The results indicate  that the firing of ON-spikes was influenced by the recent firing of  OFF-spikes, and vice versa.  As a result of this interaction, OFF/ON  sequence of light intensity change was encoded with a spike pair  with an interval of 20 ms, indicating that temporal coding is  utilized in the vertebrate visual system as early as the retina.   Thus, the present results suggest that retinal neuronal circuits may detect specific sequential features of stimuli. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  18 Refs.

Title: Neural assemblies: Technical issues, analysis, and modeling
Abstract: Neurons often work together to compute and process information, and  neural assemblies arise from synaptic interactions and neural  circuits.  One way to study neural assemblies is to simultaneously  record from several or many neurons and study the statistical  relations among their spike trains.  From this analysis researchers  can try to understand the nature of the assemblies, which can also  lead to attempts at modeling the underlying mechanisms.  In this  review we discuss three important parts of this process: (1)  technical issues related to simultaneously recording more than one  single unit, (2) ways of analyzing the data and (3) recent models  offering hypothetical mechanisms of neural assemblies, especially  models which incorporate feedback. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: A systematic neuro-fuzzy modeling framework with application to  material property prediction
Abstract: A systematic neural-fuzzy modelling framework that includes the  initial fuzzy model self-generation, significant input selection,  partition validation, parameter optimization, and rule-base  simplification is proposed in this paper.  In this framework, the  structure identification and parameter optimization are carried out  automatically and efficiently by the combined use of a  self-organization network, fuzzy clustering, adaptive  back-propagation learning, and similarity analysis-based model  simplification.  The proposed neuro-fuzzy modelling approach has been used for nonlinear system identification and mechanical property  prediction in hot-rolled steels from construct composition and  microstructure data.  Experimental studies demonstrate that the  predicted mechanical properties have a good agreement with the  measured data by using the elicited fuzzy model with a small number  of rules.  31 Refs.

Title: Adaptive observers for unknown general nonlinear systems
Abstract: Several neural network (NN) models have been applied successfully for modeling complex nonlinear dynamical systems.  However, the stable  adaptive state estimation of an unknown general nonlinear system  from its input and output measurements is an unresolved problem.   This paper addresses the nonlinear adaptive observer design for  unknown general non-linear systems.  Only mild assumptions on the  system are imposed: output equation is at least C**1 and existence  and uniqueness of solution for the state equation.  The proposed  observer uses linearly parameterized neural networks (LPNNs) whose  weights are adaptively adjusted, and Lyapunov theory is used in  order to guarantee stability for state estimation and NN weight  errors.  No strictly positive real (SPR) assumption on the output  error equation is required for the construction of the proposed  observer.  25 Refs.

Title: A novel approach to the classification of the transient phenomena in  power transformers using combined wavelet transform and neural  network
Abstract: The wavelet transform is a powerful tool in the analysis of the power transformer transient phenomena because of its ability to extract  information from the transient signals simultaneously in both the  time and frequency domain.  This paper presents a novel technique for accurate discrimination between an internal fault and a magnetizing  inrush current in the power transformer by combining wavelet  transforms with neural networks.  The wavelet transform is firstly  applied to decompose the differential current signals of the power  transformer into a series of detailed wavelet components.  The  spectral energies of the wavelet components are calculated and then  employed to train a neural network to discriminate an internal fault from the magnetizing inrush current.  The simulated results presented clearly show that the proposed technique can accurately discriminate between an internal fault and a magnetizing inrush current in power  transformer protection.  13 Refs.

Title: A comparative study of neural network efficiency in power  transformers diagnosis using dissolved gas analysis
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of neural network (NN)  efficiency for the detection of incipient faults in power  transformers.  The NN was trained according to five diagnosis  criteria commonly used for dissolved gas analysis (DGA) in  transformer insulating oil.  These criteria are Doernenburg, modified Rogers, Rogers, IEC and CSUS.  Once trained, the neural network was  tested by using a new set of DGA results.  Finally, NN diagnosis  results were compared with those obtained by inspection and an  annalist.  The study shows that NN rate of successful diagnosis is  dependant on the criterion under consideration, with values in the  range of 87-100%.  15 Refs.

Title: A combination fingerprint classifier
Abstract: Fingerprint classification is an important indexing method for any  large scale fingerprint recognition system or database as a method  for reducing the number of fingerprints that need to be searched  when looking for a matching print.  Fingerprints are generally  classified into broad categories based on global characteristics.   This paper describes novel methods of classification using hidden  Markov models (HMMs) and decision trees to recognize the ridge  structure of the print, without needing to detect singular points.   The methods are compared and combined with a standard fingerprint  classification algorithm and results for the combination are  presented using a standard database of fingerprint images.  The paper also describes a method for achieving any level of accuracy required of the system by sacrificing the efficiency of the classifier.  The  accuracy of the combination classifier is shown to be higher than  that of two state-of-the-art systems tested under the same  conditions.  29 Refs.

Title: Adaptive neural network control for smart materials robots using  singular perturbation technique
Abstract: An adaptive neural network controller is presented for smart  materials robots using singular Perturbation techniques by modeling  the flexible modes and their derivatives as the fast variables and  link variables as slow variables.  The neural network (NN) controller is to control the slow dynamics in order to eliminate the need for  the tedious dynamic modeling and the error prone process in  obtaining the regressor matrix.  In addition, inverse dynamic model  evaluation is not required and the time-consuming training process  is avoided except for initializing the NNs based on the approximate  function values at the initial posture at time t=0.  The smart  materials bonded along the links are used to active suppress the  residue vibration.  Simulation results have shown that the controller can control the system successfully and effectively.  22 Refs.

Title: Robust adaptive control of robots using neural network: Global  stability
Abstract: A desired compensation adaptive law-based neural network (DCAL-NN)  controller is proposed for the robust position control of rigid-link robots.  The NN is used to approximate a highly nonlinear function.   The controller can guarantee the global asymptotic stability of  tracking errors and boundedness of NN weights.  In addition, the NN  weights here are tuned on-line, with no off-line-learning phase  required.  When compared with standard adaptive robot controllers, we do not require linearity in the parameters, or lengthy and tedious  preliminary analysis to determine a regression matrix.  The  controller can be regarded as a universal reusable controller  because the same controller can be applied to any type of rigid  robots without any modifications.  A comparative simulation study  with different robust and adaptive controllers is included.  21 Refs.

Title: Nonlinear control via generalized feedback linearization using neural networks
Abstract: A novel approach to nonlinear control, called Generalized Feedback  Linearization (GFL), is presented.  This new strategy overcomes one  important drawback of the well known Feedback Linearization  strategy, in the sense that it is able to handle a broader class of  nonlinear systems, namely those having unstable zero dynamics.  It is shown that the use of a nonlinear predictor for the system output is a key feature in the derivation of the control strategy.  For certain types of systems this predictor can be found as a nonlinear function of the system input and output, allowing an output feedback control  solution.  The use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN ) to directly  parameterize the predictor of the controlled variable when an  explicit model for the system is not available, is investigated via  computer simulations.  This approach is based on the functional  approximation capability of multi layer ANN.  17 Refs.

Title: Statistics-based approach for rule extraction from neural networks
Abstract: From the functional point of view, a statistics-based approach for  rule extraction from trained neural networks is proposed.  This  approach introduces statistical technique to evaluate extracted  rules so that the rule set could well cover the instance space.  It  deals with continuous attributes in a unique way so that the  subjectivity and complexity of discretization are lowered.  It adopts ordered rule representation so that not only the rules have concise  appearance but also the consistency process could be released when  the rules are used.  Moreover, this approach is independent of the  architecture and training algorithm so that it could be easily  applied to diversified neural classifiers.  Experimental results show that the symbolic rules extracted via this approach are  comprehensible, compact, and with high fidelity.  15 Refs.

Title: Scaled conjugate gradient and Bayesian training of neural networks  for fault identification in cylinders
Abstract: This paper compares Bayesian training of neural networks using hybrid Monte Carlo to scaled conjugate gradient method for fault  identification in cylinders using vibration data.  From the measured  data pseudo-modal energies and modal properties are calculated and  the coordinate pseudo-modal energy assurance criterion (COMEAC) and  the coordinate modal assurance criterion (COMAC) are computed  respectively.  The pseudo-modal energies, modal properties, COMEAC  and COMAC are used to train four neural networks.  On average, the  pseudo-modal-energy-networks are more accurate than the  modal-property-networks.  The weighted averages of the  pseudo-modal-energy- and modal-property-networks form a committee of networks.  The committee method gives lower mean squared errors and  better classification of faults than the individual methods.  The  Bayesian training is found to be more accurate and computationally  expensive than the scaled conjugate gradient method and to give  confidence levels. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: Neural network-based inverse analysis for defect identification with  laser ultrasonics
Abstract: This paper describes an application of the neural network-based  inverse analysis method to the identification of a surface defect  hidden in a solid, using laser ultrasonics.  The inverse analysis  method consists of three subprocesses.  First, sample data of  identification parameters versus dynamic responses of displacements  at several monitoring points on the surface are calculated using the dynamic finite-element method.  Second, the back-propagation neural  network is trained using the sample data.  Finally, the well-trained  network is utilized for defect identification.  Fundamental  performance of the method is examined quantitatively and in detail,  through both numerical simulations and laser ultrasonics  experiments.  Locations and depths of vertical defects are  successfully estimated within 12.5% and 4.1% errors relative to the  specimen thickness, respectively.  40 Refs.

Title: Improving the efficiency of a wastewater treatment plant by fuzzy  control and neural networks
Abstract: One of the main problems in operating a wastewater treatment plant is the purification of the excess water from dewatering and pressing of sludge.  Because of a high load of organic material and of nitrogen  it has to be buffered and treated together with the inflowing  wastewater.  Different control strategies are discussed.  A  combination of neural network for predicting outflow values one hour in advance and fuzzy controller for dosing the sludge water are  presented.  This design allows the construction of a highly  non-linear predictive controller adapted to the behaviour of the  controlled system with a relatively simple and easy to optimise  fuzzy controller.  Measurement results of its operation on a  municipal wastewater treatment plant of 60,000 inhabitant  equivalents are presented and discussed.  In several months of  operation the system has proved very reliable and robust tool for  improving the system's efficiency.  18 Refs.

Title: A fuzzy ARTMAP-based Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship  (QSPR) for predicting physical properties of organic compounds
Abstract: A modified fuzzy ARTMAP neural-network-based QSPR for predicting  normal boiling points, critical temperatures, and critical pressures of organic compounds was developed.  Seven or eight molecular  descriptors (the sum of atomic numbers; five valence connectivity  indices; and the second-order kappa shape index, without or with the dipole moment) were used to describe the topological and electronic  features of a heterogeneous set of 1168 organic compounds.  Optimal  training and testing sets were selected with fuzzy ART.  The fuzzy  ARTMAP models with eight descriptors as input provided the best  predictive and extrapolation capabilities compared to optimal  back-propagation models and group contribution methods.  The absolute mean errors of predictions for the normal boiling point (1168  compounds), the critical temperature (530 compounds), and the  critical pressure (463 compounds) were 2.0 K (0.49%), 1.4 K (0.24%), and 0.02 MPa (0.52%), respectively.  A composite model for  simultaneously estimating the three properties yielded similar  results.  46 Refs.

Title: The enhancement of empirical model capability and optimal/robust  design of intractable processes
Abstract: Most industrial systems are developed and improved more from  experimental data than from theoretical analysis.  In this work, the  robust design and optimal design of products and processes are  developed using an information-index-based artificial neural network response surface.  The structure and training policy of such an  artificial neural network model are determined by the  cross-validation information index (CVI for short) developed in this work.  In the case of noisy and limited experimental data, this  information index is particularly useful for finding the number of  nodes in the hidden layer and the weighting of the smoothness  factor.  The polymer composite pultrusion process is studied.   Simulation and experimental results show that this novel approach is highly effective and promising.  35 Refs.

Title: A method for automated temporal knowledge acquisition applied to  sleep-related breathing disorders
Abstract: This paper presents a method for the discovery of temporal patterns  in multivariate time series and their conversion into a linguistic  knowledge representation applied to sleep-related breathing  disorders.  The main idea lies in introducing several abstraction  levels that allow a step-wise identification of temporal patterns.   Self-organizing neural networks are used to discover elementary  patterns in the time series.  Machine learning (ML) algorithms use  the results of the neural networks to automatically generate a  rule-based description.  At the next levels, temporal grammatical  rules are inferred.  This method covers one of the main 'bottlenecks' in the design of knowledge-based systems, namely, the knowledge  acquisition problem.  An evaluation of the rules lead to an overall  sensitivity of 0.762, and a specificity of 0.758.  Copyright copy  2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  47 Refs.

Title: Application of artificial neural network in optimization of rectisol  process
Abstract: The modified back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) was  trained by orthogonal experiment to get the input parameters and the rectisol process simulator (RPS) based on exact mathematical models  was used to obtain the output parameters.  The results show that ANN  is successful in simulating the rectisol process and can be used as  "black box" model to replace the rigorous RPS models.  Complex  algorithm was used to optimize the critical process conditions of  rectisol system, which uses the trained ANN as a mathematical model, so that the optimization problem was greatly simplified and the  computational time decreases significantly.  The optimization results show that the product quantity of CO//2 is increased and the load of refrigerated ammonia is reduced.  These results can be used to guide  the operation of ammonia plant.

Title: Artificial intelligence methods for selection of an optimized sensor  array for identification of volatile organic compounds
Abstract: We have investigated two artificial intelligence (AI)-based  approaches for the optimum selection of a sensor array for the  identification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  The array  consists of quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs), each coated with a  different polymeric material.  The first approach uses a decision  tree classification algorithm to determine the minimum number of  features that are required to classify the training data correctly.   The second approach employs the hill-climb search algorithm to  search the feature space for the optimal minimum feature set that  maximizes the performance of a neural network classifier.  We also  examined the value of simple statistical procedures that could be  integrated into the search algorithm in order to reduce computation  time.  The strengths and limitations of each approach are discussed.   copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  46 Refs.

Title: Rule extraction from expert heuristics: A comparative study of rough  sets with neural networks and ID3
Abstract: The rule extraction capability of neural networks is an issue of  interest to many researchers.  Even though neural networks offer high accuracy in classification and prediction, there are criticisms on  the complicated and non-linear transformation performed in the  hidden layers.  It is difficult to explain the relationships between  inputs and outputs and derive simple rules governing the  relationships between them.  As alternatives, some researchers  recommend the use of rough sets or ID3 for rule extraction.  This  paper reviews and compares the rule extraction capabilities of rough sets with neural networks and ID3.  We apply the methods to analyze  expert heuristic judgments.  Strengths and weaknesses of the methods  are compared, and implications for the use of the methods are  suggested. copy 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  69  Refs.

Title: Differentiating between good credits and bad credits using  neuro-fuzzy systems
Abstract: To evaluate consumer loan applications, loan officers use many  techniques such as judgmental systems, statistical models, or simply intuitive experience.  In recent years, fuzzy systems and neural  networks have attracted the growing interest of researchers and  practitioners.  This study compares the performance of artificial  neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) and multiple discriminant  analysis models to screen potential defaulters on consumer loans.   Using a modeling sample and a test sample, we find that the  neuro-fuzzy system performs better than the multiple discriminant  analysis approach to identify bad credit applications.  Further,  neuro-fuzzy systems have many advantages over traditional  computational methods.  Neuro-fuzzy system models are flexible, more  tolerant of imprecise data, and can model non-linear functions of  arbitrary complexity. copy 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We show how  using self-organizing maps we can grow clusters in a dynamic fashion and thus explicitly capture relationships between the software  measures and quantify these dependencies for larger and less  homogeneous clusters of software modules.  The experimental  environment exploited in this study relies on software measures  coming from 10 large public domain systems, 5 Java and 5 C++  systems. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Title: DSP-based techniques for speech training of hearing impaired children
Abstract: The paper describes several digital signal processing (DSP)  techniques used in the development of a computer-based speech  trainer for hearing impaired children.  Children with congenital  hearing impairments have difficulties in speaking, and even in  making the basic sounds associated with speech.  Speech therapists  use specialized training methods to train such children.  The dearth  of qualified speech therapists, and other facilities hinder the  speech development of many children in need of such training in Sri  Lanka.  The speech trainer described in this paper was developed as  an alleviation to the above problem.  The training tool developed,  will aid a child with initial guidance from an adult, to master the  pronunciation of initial sounds taught in a speech therapy  programme, in a game-like environment.  In its current status, the  training tool can guide children in pronouncing the five vowel  sounds, the first step in a speech therapy course.  12 Refs.

The results show that  the influence of welding currents on nugget diameters or shear loads of spot welds can be predicted by ANN, and the predicted curves made by ANN conform to the principles of resistance spot welding.  So the  application of ANN in quality predicting of Zinc-coated steel sheets is feasible.  5 Refs.

Title: Intelligent computational methods for corrosion damage assessment
Abstract: Corrosion is one of the damage mechanisms affecting the structural  integrity of aging aircraft structures.  Various nondestructive  inspection (NDI) techniques are being used to obtain images of  corroded regions on structures.  A computational approach using  wavelet transforms and artificial neural networks to analyze and  quantify the extent of corrosion damage from the NDI images is  described.  The wavelet parameters obtained from the images were  first used to classify between corroded and uncorroded regions using a clustering algorithm.  The corroded regions were further analyzed  to obtain the material loss due to corrosion using an artificial  neural network model.  Experiments were carried out to investigate  the developed methods for aircraft panels with engineered corrosion  obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration Validation Center  in Albuquerque.  The results presented indicate that the  computational methods developed for corrosion analysis seem to  provide reasonable results for estimating material loss due to  corrosion damage.  32 Refs.

The 3-D orthogonal neural network  avoids local minima and converges rapidly.  After the neural network  has been well trained, the mathematic model of the bone defect  surface is generated, and the pixel positions are derived.

Abstract: Linear variational inequality is a uniform approach for some  important problems in optimization problems and equilibrium  problems.  In this paper, a neural network for solving a class of  extended linear variational inequality is presented based on the  projection method.  No parameter is involved in the proposed neural  network, its structure is very simple and it can be implemented in  simple hardware when the feasible region is simple.  The proposed  neural network can be used to solve a broad classes of optimization  problems and some existing models for solving ordinary linear  variational inequalities can be derived from it.  The proposed neural network is proved to be Lyapunov stable and converge asymptotically  to an exact solution of the problem.  The feasibility and  effectiveness of the proposed network are confirmed by numerical  simulations.  13 Refs.

Title: ANN inverse mapping technique applied to electromagnetic design
Abstract: This paper examines the use of inverse mapping for the design of  electromagnetic devices whose performance is described by an  artificial neural network (ANN).  In cases where the function  describing the inverse problem is ill-conditioned, it may be very  difficult to train a neural network to learn the inverse problem.  In these cases, an iterative method based on an inverse mapping  technique may be employed.  When provided with the desired output  vector, this method uses backpropagation to train (solve) for the  unknown parameters in the input vector.  The results of using the ANN based inverse mapping approach in the design optimization of a  hollow transmission line are presented.  8 Refs.

Title: Prediction of dynamic hysteresis under highly distorted exciting  fields by neural networks and actual frequency transplantation
Abstract: Neural Network (NN) and actual frequency transplantation (AFT) are  combined for prediction of dynamic hysteresis when the exciting  field, H(t), is highly polluted by harmonics.  The NN forecasts the  Fourier Series for flux density for well-known H(t) waveforms (i.e., triangular, square wave fields etc.).  The task of AFT is to approach the arbitrary distortion of H(t) by exploiting loop predictions by  NN under pure sinusoidal excitations and then by transplanting loop  branches related to frequencies detected in short time-windows of  the H(t) period.  These actual frequencies will be evaluated by an  appropriate time-frequency analysis of H(t).  Model validations will  be presented in comparison with experimental data.  10 Refs.

Abstract: This paper describes the development of inferential models for the  provision of real-time, on-line estimates of the quality of a  breakfast cereal for production line operators.  Five quality  variables were selected and on-line measurements reflective of the  key process conditions were identified.  Following process data  logging, a number of linear and non-linear data-based modelling  methods were applied to identify relationships between the on-line  measurements and the product quality.  Off-line verification of the  models indicated that the prediction accuracy achieved was  sufficient to offer the opportunity for quality control  improvements.  The models were subsequently implemented on-line to  provide the process operators with frequent estimates of product  quality.  Performance assessment has indicated a reduction in the  variability of all five quality parameters.  In addition to details  of the modelling, the decisions relating to the development strategy and justification for implementation are considered. copy 2001  Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: Particle size distribution determination from spectral extinction  using neural networks
Abstract: The use of techniques based on spectral extinction to recover  particle size distributions has become increasingly popular in  recent years.  However, they are time-consuming and are not always  successful in practical applications.  In this paper, a novel method  is proposed to determine particle size distributions using neural  networks from several spectral extinction measurements.  Simulations  and experiments have illustrated that it is feasible to use a neural network to obtain the parameters of a particle size distribution  from turbidity measurements.  Although the neural network was trained using log-normal distribution data, it can be used to recover some  non-log-normal distributions.  The method has advantages of  simplicity of use, instantaneous delivery of results, and  suitability for online particle size analysis.  18 Refs.

Title: An overview of optimal sensor location methods for damage detection
Abstract: Recent years have shown considerable progress on the problem of  determining the optimal type, number and location of sensors in  engineering structures.  The aim of this paper is to give an overview of different methodologies which can be used to position integrated  sensors for structural damage detection.  The focus is on  combinatorial optimisation, neural network and information theory.  A simple example which illustrates the ideas is presented.  This  involves piezoceramic sensor location for impact damage detection in composite structures.  Although, the example presented in the paper  is related to piezoceramic sensors and damage detection, the methods shown are generic and can be used to solve any sensor/actuator  location problem in smart structures.  26 Refs.

Title: A neural network approach on reverse engineering surface reasoning in the manufacturing field
Abstract: This paper applied the neural network technology to surface reasoning in reverse engineering and established the neural network  computation model.  One of the main advantages of reasoning solid  surface using neural network is that no knowledge about surface is  needed, and the limited measured points on the surface will do  sufficiently.  This paper listed the related reasoning cases,  including the elementary analytical surfaces and freeform surfaces,  discussed the various issues occurring during reasoning process and  proved the feasibility and efficiency of this approach from theory  and practical computing cases.  The results show that a neural  network is an excellent aided analysis means for surface reasoning  in reversing engineering and possesses practical use for the surface that is complex, incomplete and partially worn-out or damaged.  14  Refs.

Title: Research on several prediction methods of membrane protein structure  and topology
Abstract: Since present prediction methods of membrane protein structure and  topology made use of mixed data sets both from experiments and  prediction as training and test sets, the reliability and accuracy  of their prediction is still under debate.  To benchmark the  performance of these methods, this commentary uses a test set of  membrane proteins created by European Bioinformatics Institute with  either available 3-D structure or experimentally confirmed  transmembrane regions.  Then the prediction results are compared and  the problems existing in these methods and important features for  successful prediction are pointed out, which may help users to  choose a more reliable prediction from different results.  Based upon recent advances in membrane protein, possible means to improve  topology prediction accuracy are discussed.  17 Refs.

Title: Incremental evolution in ANNs: Neural nets which grow
Abstract: This paper explains the optimisation of neural network topology using Incremental Evolution; that is, by allowing the network to expand by adding to its structure.  This method allows a network to grow from a simple to a complex structure until it is capable of fulfilling its  intended function.  The approach is somewhat analogous to the growth  of an embryo or the evolution of a fossil line through time, it is  therefore sometimes referred to as an embryology or embryological  algorithm.  The paper begins with a general introduction, comparing  this method to other competing techniques such as The Genetic  Algorithm, other Evolutionary Algorithms and Simulated Annealing.  A  literature survey of previous work is included, followed by an  extensive new framework for application of the technique.  Finally,  examples of applications and a general discussion are presented.  28  Refs.

Title: Compensatory fuzzy neural networks-based intelligent detection of  abnormal neonatal cerebral Doppler ultrasound waveforms
Abstract: Compensatory fuzzy neural networks (CFNN) without normalization,  which can be trained with a backpropagation learning algorithm, is  proposed as a pattern recognition technique for intelligent  detection of Doppler ultrasound wave-forms of abnormal neonatal  cerebral hemodynamics.  Doppler ultrasound signals were recorded from the anterior cerebral arteries of 40 normal full-term babies and 14  mature babies with intracranial pathology.  The features of normal  and abnormal groups as inputs to pattern recognition algorithms were extracted from the maximum velocity waveforms by using principal  component analysis.  The proposed technique is compared with the CFNN with normalization and other pattern recognition techniques applied  to Doppler ultrasound signals from various arteries.  The results  show that the proposed method is superior to the others, and can be  a powerful technique to be used in analyzing Doppler ultrasound  signals from various arteries.  32 Refs.

Title: Perceiving geometric patterns: From spirals to inside-outside  relations
Abstract: Since first proposed by Minsky and Papert, the spiral problem is well known in neural networks.  It receives much attention as a benchmark  for various learning algorithms.  Unlike previous work that  emphasizes learning, we approach the problem from a different  perspective.  We point out that the spiral problem is intrinsically  connected to the inside-outside problem proposed by Ullman.  We  propose a solution to both problems based on oscillatory correlation using a time-delay network.  Our simulation results are qualitatively consistent with human performance, and we interpret human  limitations in terms of synchrony and time delays.  As a special  case, our network without time delays can always distinguish these  figures regardless of shape, position, size, and orientation.  52  Refs.

Title: Multiwavelet neural network and its approximation properties
Abstract: A model of multiwavelet-based neural networks is proposed.  Its  universal and L**2 approximation properties, together with its  consistency are proved, and the convergence rates associated with  these properties are estimated.  The structure of this network is  similar to that of the wavelet network, except that the orthonormal  scaling functions here are replaced by orthonormal multiscaling  functions.  The theoretical analyses show that the multiwavelet  network converges more rapidly than the wavelet network, especially  for smooth functions.  To make a comparison between both networks,  experiments are carried out with the Lemarie-Meyer wavelet network,  the Daubechies2 wavelet network and the GHM multiwavelet network,  and the results support the theoretical analysis well.  In addition,  the results also illustrate that at the jump discontinuities, the  approximation performance of the two networks are about the same.  13 Refs.

Title: Classification of noisy signals using fuzzy ARTMAP neural networks
Abstract: This paper describes an approach to classification of noisy signals  using a technique based on the fuzzy ARTMAP neural network (FAMNN).   The proposed method is a modification of the testing phase of the  fuzzy ARTMAP that exhibits superior generalization performance  compared to the generalization performance of the standard fuzzy  ARTMAP in the presence of noise.  An application to textured  grayscale image segmentation is presented.  The superiority of the  proposed modification over the standard fuzzy ARTMAP is established  by a number of experiments using various texture sets, feature  vectors and noise types.  The texture sets include various aerial  photos and also samples obtained from the Brodatz album.   Furthermore, the classification performance of the standard and the  modified fuzzy ARTMAP is compared for different network sizes.   Classification results that illustrate the performance of the  modified algorithm and the FAMNN are presented.  27 Refs.

Title: Theoretical properties of recursive neural networks with linear  neurons
Abstract: Recursive neural networks are a powerful tool for processing  structured data, thus filling the gap between connectionism, which  is usually related to poorly organized data, and a great variety of  real-world problems, where the information is naturally encoded in  the relationships among the basic entities.  In this paper, some  theoretical results about linear recursive neural networks are  presented that allow us to establish conditions on their dynamical  properties and their capability to encode and classify structured  information.  A lot of the limitations of the linear model,  intrinsically related to recursive processing, are inherited by the  general model, thus establishing also their computational  capabilities and range of applicability.  As a byproduct of our study some connections with the classical linear system theory are given  where the processing is extended from sequences to graphs.  20 Refs.

Title: Numerical solutions to the Witsenhausen counterexample by  approximating networks
Abstract: Approximate solutions to the Witsenhausen counterexample are derived  by constraining the unknown control functions to take on fixed  structures containing "free" parameters to be optimized.  Such  structures are given by "nonlinear approximating networks", i.e.,  linear combinations of parametrized basis functions that benefit by  density properties in normed linear spaces.  This reduces the  original functional problem to a nonlinear programming one which is  solved via stochastic approximation.  The method yields lower values  of the costs than the ones achieved so far in the literature, and,  most of all, provides rather a complete overview of the shapes of  the optimal control functions when the two parameters that  characterize the Witsenhausen counterexample vary.  One-hidden-layer  neural networks are chosen as approximating networks.  23 Refs.

Title: Acceleration signal estimation using neural networks
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a neural-network-based approach to  acquiring angular acceleration from a noisy velocity signal.  Our  scheme consists of two cascaded neural networks: Neural network I  (NN I) and neural network II (NN II).  NN I attenuates harmful  measurement noise from the velocity input.  NN II further reduces the residual noise level, and gives the one-step-ahead prediction of the final acceleration signal.  As an illustrative example, we discuss  the application of our method in the elevator velocity and  acceleration acquisition problem.  Two different kinds of neural  network model are employed here, the back-propagation neural network (BP) and the adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS),  to act as NN I and NN II.  We also compare the performances of these  two neural networks using numerical simulations.  25 Refs.

Title: On-line fault diagnosis based on B-spline neural networks using  asymptotic local approach
Abstract: Fault diagnosis is crucial in monitoring industrial processes.  Faults can be often detected from residuals generated from the system  model.  For systems with known models, residuals can be readily  generated.  However, for systems with unknown models, neural networks can be used to model the system.  For small or incipient faults, it  is difficult to detect faults directly from the residuals.  The  asymptotic local approach, which transforms the fault diagnosis  problem into one that detects statistical changes in a random  variable, is proposed.  The proposed scheme is illustrated by a  simulation example, and comparison with faults obtained directly  from the residuals is also made.  (Edited abstract) 10 Refs.

Title: Predictive model based on artificial neural network for fatigue  performance of prior-corroded aluminum alloys
Abstract: A prediction model for corrosion and fatigue performance of the  prior-corroded aluminum alloys under a varied corrosion  environmental spectrum based on artificial neural network was  developed and the nonlinear relationship among maximum corrosion  depth, fatigue performance, corrosion temperature and time was  established, based on BP (back propagation) learning algorithm  analysis and convergence improvement.  The maximum corrosion depth  and fatigue performance of prior-corroded aluminum alloys can be  predicted by means of the trained neural network from the testing  data.  By virtue of the prediction model, the future corrosion status and fatigue performance of aluminum alloys can be evaluated under  random complicated environmental spectrum.

An abductive neural network is used to establish the surface  parameter equation, the result showing that it is capable of  accuracy in predicting the control point of the surface coordinate  and any points on the surface.  Further, it is capable of being  applied in the development of an industrial product and in  facilitating the modification of the product, and in the planning of a CAM path. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Fault prognostics using dynamic wavelet neural networks
Abstract: Modern industry is concerned about extending the lifetime of its  critical processes and maintaining them only when required.   Significant aspects of these trends include the ability to diagnose  impending failures, prognosticate the remaining useful lifetime of  the process and schedule maintenance operations so that uptime is  maximized.  Prognosis is probably the most difficult of the three  issues leading to condition-based maintenance (CBM).  This paper  attempts to address this challenging problem with  intelligence-oriented techniques, specifically dynamic wavelet  neural networks (DWNNs).  DWNNs incorporate temporal information and  storage capacity into their functionality so that they can predict  into the future, carrying out fault prognostic tasks.  Such  fundamental issues as the network structure, learning algorithms,  stability analysis, uncertainty management, and performance  assessment are studied in a theoretical framework.  An example is  presented in which a trained DWNN successfully prognoses a defective bearing with a crack in its inner race.  23 Refs.

Title: Neural fuzzy analysis of delaminated composites from shearography  imaging
Abstract: The use of shearography for impact damage detection and  characterization is often difficult to achieve in laminated  composites due to lack of a formation of clear fringe patterns as in the case of delaminations.  Furthermore, existing techniques for  interpreting shearograms are often inadequate for impact damage  assessment in composite materials.  In this paper, a technique is  reported that combines conventional image analysis with neural  networks (NNs) classification and fuzzy logic inference to  characterize shearograms.  The objective is to train an automated  system for recognition of pertinent characteristics and features  from shearograms of composites damaged by impact.  The results  demonstrate the potential of the NN-based shearography technique in  characterizing damage in laminated composites.  Its applicability to  structural health monitoring is also discussed. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  6 Refs.

Title: A robust video classification and segmentation method
Abstract: In this paper, we present a robust algorithm for audio classification that is capable of segmenting and classifying an audio stream into  speech, music, environment sound and silence.  Audio classification  is processed in two steps, which makes it suitable for different  applications.  The first step of the classification is speech and  non-speech discrimination.  In this step, a novel algorithm based on  KNN and LSP VQ is presented.  The second step further divides  non-speech class into music, environment sounds and silence with a  rule based classification scheme.  Some new features such as the  noise frame ratio and band periodicity are introduced and discussed  in detail.  Our experiments in the context of video structure parsing have shown the algorithms produce very satisfactory results.  14  Refs.

Title: A hybrid neural network and genetic algorithm approach to the  determination of initial process parameters for injection moulding
Abstract: Determination of the initial process parameters for injection  moulding is a highly skilled task and is based on a skilled  operator's "know-how" and intuitive sense acquired through long-term experience rather than on a theoretical and analytical approach, In  the face of global competition, the current trial-and-error practice is inadequate.  In this paper, a hybrid neural network and genetic  algorithm approach is described to determine a set of initial  process parameters for injection moulding.  A hybrid neural network  and genetic algorithm system for the determination of initial  process parameter settings for injection moulding based on the  proposed approach was developed and validated.  The preliminary  validation test of the system has indicated that the system can  determine a set of initial process parameters for injection moulding quickly, from which good quality moulded parts can be produced  without relying on experienced moulding personnel.  14 Refs.

Title: Research on speech distortion measure based on neural network
Abstract: This paper puts forward a novel spectrum distortion measure (MSD) of  speech based on artificial neural network (ANN).  It provides the MSD with the capability of employing subjective behavior of perception  of human auditory system, by using the theory of approaching to  nonlinear function of multilayer perceptions and radial basis  function networks.  In the application of speech quality objective  assessment, the result of subjective evaluation under plenty of  distortion conditions is directly used as the desired value of  training.  Statistic analysis shows that, comparing with traditional  Euclidian distance and weight Euclidian distance, the correlation of subjective to objective of MSD based on ANN has great improvement,  also are the reliability and robustness.  It has the property of  technological independence.  (Edited abstract) 12 Refs.

Title: Axial strain estimation of tissue mimicking phantom based on acoustic shear wave
Abstract: The mechanics characteristics of soft tissue are closely related to  its physiological and pathological states.  Ultrasound elasticity  imaging technique is evolving into a new diagnosis modality for  nondestructive examination of tissue mechanics characteristics.  The  use of shear acoustic waves remotely induced in a localized region  of soft tissue by the radiation force of a focused ultrasonic beam  can greatly simplify the elasticity reconstruction process.  An  accurate parallel time-delay estimation method based on PCA neural  network was proposed to measure the axial displacement and strain of the tissue mimicking phantom.  The axial strain and the elasticity  distribution can then be obtained.  The results show that this method has the advantages of high spatial resolution and insensitiveness to noise and it is feasible for remotely estimating the axial  displacement and strain of soft tissue in deep region.

Abstract: Electroless plating method is used to metallize the AIN substrate.   The improved neural network is applied in the study of the  relationship between reaction parameters of electroless plating  nickel in the process of the metallization of aluminum nitride and  the adhesion strength between the metal layer and the substrate.  To  make neural network more robust, a novel robust estimation function  is proposed to improve the feedforward neural network according to  the theorem of statistics.  A quantitative prediction model is  developed.  The optimum operation region of the process parameters is found in the new neural network.

Title: Prediction of flow stress of Ti-15-3 alloy with artificial neural  network
Abstract: Hot compression experiments were conducted on Ti-15-3 alloy specimens using Gleeble-1500 thermal simulator.  These tests were focused to  obtain the flow stress data under various conditions of strain,  strain rate and temperature.  On the basis of these data, the  predicting model for the nonlinear relations between flow stress and deformation strain, strain rate and temperature for Ti-15-3 alloy  was developed with the back-propagation artificial neural network  method.  Results show that the neural network can reproduce the flow  stress in the sampled data and predict the nonsampled data well.   Thus it has been verified that the neural network method can be used to tackle hot deformation problems of Ti-15-3 alloy.  (Edited  abstract) 9 Refs.

Abstract: The effects of variations in bifurcation parameter on coherence  resonance in the noisy FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neuron model are  studied.  We find that the coherence resonance effect depends  monotonically on the firing bifurcation parameter, and this result  is interpreted analytically.  Then an external control method is  presented to modulate coherence resonance in the excitable neuron  model, and our scheme is based on the result that a weak periodic  perturbation can be used to change the critical firing onset value.   This method can be used to either enhance the effect of coherence  resonance or delay the occurrence of coherence resonance, and the  application of the method to another neuron model is also discussed. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The  control strategy of the switching signals to compensate current  harmonic of the inverter is also discussed and the switching signals are generated with the space voltage vector modulation scheme.

Title: Predictive control of active power filters
Abstract: A novel technique for generation of a contemporary estimate of the  fundamental component of the distorted input current or voltage to  an uncontrolled three-phase bridge rectifier with DC link smoothing  filter is presented.  This allows for accurate calculation of  cancellation references for series and shunt APFs operating under  steady-state and transient conditions.  Improved transient  performance allows for reduction of the power rating and control  system bandwidth of an APF.  An artificial neural network (ANN)  predictor has been used to calculate the mean dq-axis input to the  rectifier without filtering.  This is the critical stage in  separating the harmonic distortion from fundamental current or  voltage.  The technique Is developed using simulation data for both  shunt and series APFs and validated with experimental results.  15  Refs.

Title: Application and optimization of neural field dynamics for driver  assistance
Abstract: Behavior planning of a vehicle in real-world traffic is a difficult  problem.  Complex systems have to be build to accomplish the  projection of tasks, environmental constraints, and purposes of the  driver to the dynamics of two controlled variables: steering angle  and velocity.  This paper comprises two parts.  First, the behavior  planning for the task of intelligent cruise control is proposed.  The controlled variables are determined by evaluating the dynamics of  two one-dimensional neural fields.  The information concerning the  actual situation and driver preferences is coupled additively into  the field.  Second, the parameters of the dynamics for the steering  angle are adjusted by a state-of-the-art evolution strategy in order to achieve a smooth, comfortable trajectory.  The behavior of the  vehicle is successfully controlled by the neural field dynamics in  the testbed of a simulation environment.  13 Refs.

The information  about the presence of a person in the passenger seat and the  position of his head is used to control the deployment of the  passenger airbag.  We use still monocular images taken from the  cockpit to make the learning step of the SVM method.  During  recognition the threshold of the decision function will be modified  by a "presence" probability distribution function.  We will show in  this paper the results of our simulations for a standard and for the modified SVM.  9 Refs.

Title: Novelty detection under changing environmental conditions
Abstract: The primary objective of novelty detection is to examine a system's  dynamic response to determine if the system significantly deviates  from an initial baseline condition.  In reality, the system is often  subject to changing environmental and operation conditions that  affect its dynamic characteristics.  Such variations include changes  in loading, boundary conditions, temperature, and moisture.  Most  damage diagnosis techniques, however, generally neglect the effects  of these changing ambient conditions.  Here, a novelty detection  technique is developed explicitly taking into account these natural  variations of the system in order to minimize false positive  indications of tree system changes.  Auto-associative neural networks are employed to discriminate system changes of interest such as  structural deterioration and damage from the natural variations of  the system.  21 Refs.

Title: Neural networks based sensor validation and recovery methodology for  advanced aircraft engines
Abstract: Within the context of preventive health maintenance in complex  engineering systems, novel sensor fault detection methodologies are  developed for an aircraft auxiliary power unit.  Promising results at operational and sensor failure conditions are obtained for  temperature and pressure sensors.  In the methodology proposed, first covariance and noise analyses of sensor data are performed.  Next,  auto-associative and hetero-associative neural networks for sensor  validation are designed and trained.  These neural networks are used  together to provide validation for pressure and temperature sensors.  The last step consists of development of detection and  identification logic for sensor faults.  In spite of high noise  levels, the methodology is shown to be very robust.  More than 90%  correct sensor failure detection is achieved when noise on the order of noise inherently present in sensor readings is added.  5 Refs.

Title: A simulation-model compiler for all seasons
Abstract: A new runtime simulation-model compiler quickly reads, compiles, and  immediately solves vector differential equations and difference  equations as well as scalar equations for dynamic-system models.   Vector assignments compactly model nonlinear as well as linear  matrix/vector relations for many problems in physics, control  systems, neural networks, and fuzzy logic.  The key feature is that  the new vector differential-equation solver can replicate a  dynamic-system model many times and then simulates hundreds of such  models in a single simulation run, e.g. for Monte-Carlo studies.   Also, partial differential equations (e.g. for a heat exchanger) can be solved together with ordinary differential equations.  Portable C  code runs on UNIX or LINUX workstations.  A fast machine-language  version for personal computers (Windows 98 and NT) directly utilizes the Pentium floating-point hardware stack, which is automatically  continued into memory. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Modelling soil behaviour in uniaxial strain conditions by neural  networks
Abstract: The feed-forward neural network was used to simulate the behaviour of soil samples in uniaxial strain conditions, i.e. to predict the  oedometer test results only on the basis of the basic soil  properties.  Artificial neural network was trained using the database of 217 samples of different cohesive soils from various locations in Slovenia.  Good agreement between neural network predictions and  laboratory test results was observed for the test samples.  This  study confirms the link between basic soil properties and  stress-strain soil behaviour and demonstrates that artificial neural network successfully predicts soil stiffness in uniaxial strain  conditions.  The comparison between the neural network prediction and empirical formulae shows that the neural network gives more accurate as well as more general solution of the problem. copy 2001  Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: Qualitative analysis of a self-correlation type complex-valued  associative memories
Abstract: This paper presents a model of associative memories using  complex-valued neural networks and studies its qualitative behaviors theoretically.  The proposed model is an extension of the  conventional real-valued associative memories of self-correlation  type.  It is shown that, in the proposed model, each memory pattern  is not an isolated equilibrium point but an equilibrium set of the  network.  We investigate the structures and asymptotic behaviors of  solution orbits near each memory pattern.  We also discuss a  recalling condition of each memory pattern, that is, a condition  which assures that each memory pattern is correctly recalled.  Some  comments on the characteristic of the real-valued version of the  proposed model are also given.  7 Refs.

Title: A neuro-fuzzy supervisory control system for industrial batch  processes
Abstract: The automation of complex industrial batch processes is a difficult  problem due to the extremely nonlinear and variable system behavior  or the conflicting goals within the different process phases.  The  introduction of a single multiple-input multiple-output controller  is not useful because of the rather high design effort and the low  transparency of its complex structure.  A more suitable hierarchical  fuzzy-logic (FL) based supervisory control concept is proposed in  this paper.  It permits the decomposition of the complex control  problem into a series of smaller and simpler ones.  In the upper  level of the hierarchy the FL-based supervisory controller  classifies the actual process phase in terms of the available  process sensor signals and activates dynamically the appropriate  situation specific low-level controllers.  This paper presents the  generic concept of the FL supervisory controller that comprises both a FL process diagnosis and a control mode selection as well as  experiences with the industrial application.  22 Refs.

Title: Vision-based terrain characterization and traversability assessment
Abstract: This article presents novel techniques for real-time terrain  characterization and assessment of terrain traversability for a  field mobile robot using a vision system and artificial neural  networks.  The key terrain traversability characteristics are  identified as roughness, slope, discontinuity, and hardness.  These  characteristics are extracted from imagery data obtained from  cameras mounted on the robot and are represented in a fuzzy logic  framework using perceptual, linguistic fuzzy sets.  The approach  adopted is highly robust and tolerant to imprecision and uncertainty inherent in sensing and perception of natural environments.  The four traversability characteristics are combined to form a single Fuzzy  Traversability Index, which quantifies the ease-of-traversal of the  terrain by the mobile robot.  Experimental results are presented to  demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach for  classification of different terrain segments based on their  traversability.  12 Refs.

It aims to  establish a non-linear relationship that accounts for the effect of  milk constituents (protein, lactose, and fat) and temperature on the electrical conductivity of recombined milk.  Various ANNs of 3-layer  and 4-layer were investigated.  Compared with 3-layer ANN models,  4-layer ANN models provide better model performance.  In addition,  log-sigmoid transfer function is proved to perform more practically  than tan-sigmoid transfer function.  The best ANN model has a 4-4-4-1 structure with log-sigmoid transfer function.  After being trained  for 4.4 multiplied by 10**5 epochs by back-propagation, the model  produced a correlation coefficient of 0.9937 between the actual  electrical conductivity (actual EC) and the modelled electrical  conductivity (modelled EC) and a SSE of 0.4864. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science Ltd.

Title: Vibration characteristics of blasting in bed rock mass at Sanxia  Project
Abstract: Taking the excavation blasting of bed rock mass in Sanxia Project as  the background, six blasting experiments have been done at the  bottom of weak weathering granite in Sanxia dam and the 36 sets of  seismic waveform at different positions away from the explosion  sources are measured.  Through the analyses of both frequency and  statistics, it is found that vibration frequency varies inversely as both the charge weight and distance away from the explosion source  and that the duration of seismic waves varies directly as the charge weight and inversely as the distance.  The attenuation law of seismic waves is determined by applying the neural network theory.   Meanwhile, the microcracking zone boundaries of rock mass in  blasting are measured using the computer tomography (CT) and their  corresponding critical vibration velocities of rock particles are  also calculated which are 13.8-16.6 cm/s.  15 Refs.

Title: Simulation of biomass gasification with a hybrid neural network model
Abstract: Gasification experiments of several types of biomass were conducted  in an atmospheric steam fluidized bed gasifier, which biomass  samples were fed into continuously and without residue discharge.  In order to obtain the gasification profiles for each type of biomass,  an artificial neural network model has been developed to simulate  the gasification process.  Model-predicted gas production rates for  the biomass gasification processes are in good agreement with the  experimental data, thereby the gasification profiles given by the  neural network model are considered to properly reflect the real  gasification process of a biomass.  Gasification profiles identified  by neural network model suggest that gasification behavior of  arboreal types of biomass is significantly different from that of  herbaceous ones.  10 Refs.

Title: Design of ANN (Artificial Neural Networks)-fast backpropagation  algorithm gain scheduling controller of active filtering
Abstract: The application of ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) to active  circuitry to increase the performance per size, prevent dependency  on some parameters of Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI) filter and determine the circuit gain directly are considered.  The major  problems are power line frequency rejection and the compensation of  the feedback loop, which is influenced by the wide-ranging utility  impedance.  While analysis and simulations show, in the literature,  that these problems prevent the practical application of active  filtering to power supplies especially less than 100 kHz, the  approximation easily demonstrates a good promise to ensure the  design of the architecture of gain scheduling controller by using  ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) for active filtering.

Title: Text-dependent speaker recognition using the Fuzzy ARTMAP neural  network
Abstract: Speaker recognition is the process of automatically recognizing the  speaker by analyzing individual information contained in the speech  waves.  In this paper, we discuss the development of an intelligent  system for text-dependent speaker recognition.  The system comprises  two main modules, a wavelet-based signal-processing module for  feature extraction of speech waves, and an  artificial-neural-network-based classifier module to identify and  categorize the speakers.  Wavelet is used in de-noising and in  compressing the speech signals.  The wavelet family that we used is  the Daubechies Wavelets.  After extracting the necessary features  from the speech waves, the features were then fed to a  neural-network-based classifier to identify the speakers.  We have  implemented the Fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) network in the classifier module  to categorize the de-noised and compressed signals.  The proposed  intelligent learning system has been applied to a case study of  text-dependent speaker recognition problem.  (Author abstract) 20  Refs.

Title: Multi-mechanism rule-extraction pipeline for use on unannotated  datasets
Abstract: We outline a hybrid methodology-incorporating both supervised and  unsupervised-learning components-for rule-based knowledge discovery  from unannotated data ie when the classification information is  unknown.  The motivation for our work stems from the individual  effectiveness of various data mining mechanisms ie: (1) class  identification via unsupervised datavector cluster formation, (2)  datavector simplification and feature selection via attribute  discretization, and (3) symbolic rule extraction via the association of symbolic rules with the structural parameters of a trained neural network (NN).  The basic operational concept involves the pipelined  application of various unsupervised and supervised mechanisms ie:  (1) k-means, (2) Chi-2, (3) local cluster (LC) network training, and (4) rule extraction from a trained LC network.  The featured  methodology will be tested and analyzed using several well-known  datasets.  (Author abstract) 14 Refs.

Title: Fuzzy preprocessing rules for the improvement of an Artificial Neural Network well log interpretation model
Abstract: The success of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based data  interpretation model depends heavily on the availability and the  characteristics of the training data.  In the process of developing a reliable well log interpretation model, a log analyst has to spend  many hours to perform pre-processing on the training data set.  This  demands substantial experience and expertise from the analyst.  This  paper proposes a fuzzy logic approach to integrate the knowledge of  the log analysts in the stage of pre-processing.  This paper also  presents results from an experimental study which demonstrated the  implementation of the fuzzy preprocessing technique which has  increased the prediction accuracy of the ANN well log interpretation model.  This new method has the potential to be a useful and  important tool for the professional well log analysts.  (Author  abstract) 10 Refs.

Title: Generation of F//0 contours using a model-constrained data-driven  method
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel model-constrained, data-driven method  for generating fundamental frequency contours in Japanese  text-to-speech synthesis.  In the training phase, the parameters of a command-response F//0 contour generation model are learned by a  prediction module, which can be a neural network or a set of binary  regression trees.  The input features consist of linguistic  information related to accentual phrases that can be automatically  derived from text, such as the position of the accentual phrase in  the utterance, number of morae, accent type, and parts-of-speech.  In the synthesis phase, the prediction module is used to generate  appropriate values of model parameters.  The use of the parametric  model restricts the degrees of freedom of the problem, facilitating  data-driven learning.  Experimental results show that the method  makes it possible to generate quite natural F//0 contours with a  relatively small training database.  10 Refs.

Title: Design of a modified PWM VLSI neural network
Abstract: The VLSI implementation of neural network is an effective approach to exhibit the advantage of neural network.  The existing VLSI neural  network design method based on the pulse width modulation (PWM)  technique is modified in this paper.  A simple synapse multiplier is  proposed, which has high precision, large linear range and less  switching noise effects.  A voltage-mode sigmoid circuit with  adjustable gain is designed for the realization of different neuron  activation functions.  A voltage-pulse conversion circuit required  for PWM is suggested, which has high conversion precision and  linearity.  These three circuits are used to design a PWM VLSI neural network to solve the exclusive or (XOR) problem.  The simulation  result shows that it can function correctly with fast recognition  speed; therefore, it is suitable for the VLSI implementation of  neural networks.  6 Refs.

Title: Construction and applications in data mining of Bayesian networks
Abstract: Bayesian network approaches have become an important research  direction in data mining.  This paper discusses the structure and the construction of Bayesian networks, emphasizing the basic methods for learning the structure and probabilities of Bayesian networks from  prior knowledge and sample data.  Compared with other approaches used for data mining, Bayesian networks can combine prior knowledge with  observed data, which is very important when data is scarce or very  expensive.  Moreover, Bayesian networks can discover causal  relationships among data and handle incomplete data sets, which  other methods can not do.  The disadvantages of Bayesian networks are the high computational cost, the difficulties in determining  appropriate parameters and structures, and the lack of principles to justify if the hypotheses required by the Bayesian network are  actually satisfied by the problems.  10 Refs.

Title: Non-linear MIMO predictive control based on wavelet networks
Abstract: Multi-variable non-linear system identification, control and  optimization problems were solved using a single variable system  identification method based on wavelet neural networks.  This method  was applied to the non-linear predictive control.  A non-linear  wavelet neural network model based domain predictive control scheme  was introduced for open-loop stable systems subjected to input  constraints.  The closed-loop stability was guaranteed by the  appropriate choice of a finite prediction horizon.  Furthermore, an  economic objective optimization strategy was developed based on the  dynamic control scheme.  The theory was applied to a polymerization  process.  Since the model is identified by a linear least square  learning algorithm, it is easily implemented and is reliable as a  generic model.  The generality of the model and the simplicity of the is identification and control method are demonstrated through  simulation studies, which show that the strategy can be used for the modelling and control of industrial non-linear systems in process  industries.  8 Refs.

Title: Study of the trainable prosodic model for Chinese text to speech  system
Abstract: Mandarin prosody is characterized by its hierarchical structures when it is influenced by the context.  An artificial on this, a neural  network, with specially weighted factors and optimizing outputs, is  described and used to construct the Mandarin prosodic model in a TTS system for Chinese.  Extensive tests show that the structure of the  artificial neural network characterizes the Mandarin prosody more  exactly than traditional models.  Learning rate is speeded up and  computational precision is improved, which makes the whole prosodic  model more efficient.  Furthermore, the paper also stylizes the  Mandarin syllable pitch contours with SPiS parameters (Syllable  Pitch Stylized Parameters), and analyzes them in adjusting the  syllable pitch.  It shows that the SPiS parameters effectively  characterize the Mandarin syllable pitch contours, and facilitate  the establishment of the network model and the prosodic controlling.

Title: Novel intelligent strategy for improving measurement precision of FOG
Abstract: This paper discusses neural network-based strategy for reducing the existing errors of fiber-optic gyroscope (FOG).  A series-single-layer neural network, which is composed of two single-layer networks in series, is presented for eliminating random noises.  This network has simpler architecture, faster learning speed, and better performance compared to conventional backpropagation (BP) networks. Accordingly, after considering the characteristics of the power law noise in FOG, an advanced learning algorithm is proposed by using the increments of errors in energy function.  Furthermore, a radial basis function (RBF) neural network-based method is also posed to evaluate and compensate the temperature drift of FOG.  The orthogonal least squares (OLS) algorithm is applied due to its simplicity, high accuracy, and fast learning speed.  The simulation results show that the series-single-layer network (SSLN) with the advanced learning algorithm provides a fast and effective way for eliminating different random noises including stable and unstable noises existing in FOG, and the RBF network-based method offers a powerful and successful procedure for evaluating and compensating the temperature drift

Title: Obstacle avoidance for a mobile robot: A neuro-fuzzy approach
Abstract: In this paper, a neuro-fuzzy approach is presented in order to guide  a mobile robot.  This task could be carried out specifying a set of  fuzzy rules taking into account the different situations found by  the mobile robot.  This set of fuzzy rules could be optimised  according to different criteria.  However, the approach shown in this paper, is able to extract a set of fuzzy rules set from a set of  trajectories provided by a human.  These trajectories guide the  mobile robot towards the target in different cases.  Thus, it has  been possible to obtain the rules and membership functions  automatically, whereas other approaches need a previous definition  of the rules and membership functions.  In order to verify that the  obtained behaviour is satisfactory, the neuro-fuzzy approach has  been implemented in two mobile robots. copy 2001 Elsevier Science  B.V.  All rights reserved.  10 Refs.

Title: Profile reconstruction of simulated natural cracks from eddy current  signals
Abstract: Based upon the fact that internal conductivity of the crack has a  serious effect on the eddy current signals, two kinds of inversion  schemes that can reconstruct cracks with non-vanishing conductivity  from eddy current signals are proposed in this paper.  One is a  physics-based approach that modifies crack parameters iteratively  and the other is a neuronet-based approach.  Two models that are  supposed to be appropriate models of a natural crack are also  proposed.  After detailed explanation of the schemes, several  reconstruction results using simulated data are presented.  The  results show these schemes can reconstruct crack profile with high  accuracy where not only shape of the crack but also internal  conductivity is unknown.  Advantages and disadvantages of both  schemes are discussed at the end of the paper. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  12 Refs.

Title: Xetra efficiency evaluation and NASDAQ modelling by KapSyn
Abstract: In this paper we give an introduction to capital market synergetics,  a model enabling us to compute transaction costs and investigate the operating efficiency of a stock market's microstructure.  Frankfurt's trading system Xetra and NASDAQ are currently implemented into the  computer program KapSyn.  By using KapSyn we examine Xetra's  behaviour in different market scenarios, particularly the designated sponsor's performance.  The empirical evidence of the KapSyn  parameter setting chosen is validated: connecting the parameter  setting to economic data by using neural networks and analytical  reasoning underlie the definition of market scenarios.  The  designated sponsor's eminent importance in non-liquid markets has  been demonstrated very impressively.  Finally, NASDAQ's transaction  cost statistics are investigated in the above scenarios.  Compared to Xetra, NASDAQ exhibits minimal transaction costs for mid-size  trades, while transaction costs for small and block trades are  nearly 100%/50% higher. copy 2001 Elsev ier Science B.V.

Title: Structural damage detection using an iterative neural network
Abstract:  A structural damage detection method based on parameter identification using an iterative neural network (NN) technique is proposed in this study.  The NN model is first trained off-line using an initial training data set that consists of assumed structural parameters as outputs and their corresponding dynamic characteristics as inputs.  The structural parameters are assumed with different levels of reduction to simulate various degrees of structural damage.  The concept of orthogonal array is adopted to generate the representative combinations of parameter changes, which can significantly reduce the number of training data while maintaining the data completeness.  A modified back-propagation learning algorithm is proposed which can overcome possible saturation of the sigmoid function and speed up the training process.  The trained NN model is used to predict the structural parameters by feeding in measured dynamic characteristics.  The predicted structural parameters are then used in the FE model to calculate the dynamic characteristics. The NN model would go through a retraining process if the calculated characteristics deviate from the measured ones. The identified structural parameters are then used to infer the location and the extent of structural damages.  The proposed method is verified both numerically and experimentally using a clamped-clamped T beam. The results indicate that the current approach can identify both the location and the extent of damages in the beam

Title: A new era of mobile shopping based on intelligent fuzzy neuro-based  shopping agents
Abstract: Owing to the increasing number of mobile e-commerce applications  using WAP technology, intelligent agent-based systems has become a  new trend of development in the new millennium.  Traditional  web-based agent systems suffer various degrees of deficiency in  terms of the provision of 'intelligent' software interfaces and  light-weighted coding to be implemented in WAP devices.  In this  paper, the author proposes a comprehensive and intelligent-based  agent platform known as 'intelligent Java Agent Development  Environment' for the development of smart (via the implementation of 'Conscious Layer'), compact and highly mobile agent applications.   From the implementation point of view, the author introduces an  intelligent fuzzy neural-based mobile shopping agent based on the  integration of WAP and Java Servlets technology.  Promising results  in terms of agent mobility, fuzzy-neural shopping efficiency and  effectiveness have been obtained.  6 Refs.

Abstract: A collection of artificial neural networks (ANN's) was trained to  identify simple anatomical structures in a set of x-ray computed  tomography (CT) images.  These neural networks learned to associate a point in an image with the anatomical structure containing the point by using the image pixels located on the horizontal and vertical  lines that ran through the point.  The neural networks were  integrated into a computer software tool whose function is to select an index into a list of CT window/level values from the location of  the user's mouse cursor.  Based upon the anatomical structure  selected by the user, the software tool automatically adjusts the  image display to optimally view the structure.  11 Refs.

Title: Short-term prediction of urban NO//2 pollution by means of artificial neural networks
Abstract: A neural network model for the short-term prediction of  concentrations of urban pollutants was developed and applied to the  Turin (Northern Italy) air quality network.  In particular, the study was focused on NO//2 concentrations measured at five stations; t + 3 and t + 24 hour NO//2 concentration forecasting based on hourly  meteorological and concentration data gave good agreement with  observed concentrations.  This is particularly true for the mean  concentration values and concentration distribution.  The time of  occurrence of peak values was correctly forecast but the amounts  were generally underestimated.  To reduce this underestimation, an  empirical step function was applied in the t + 24 case.  This allowed an accurate estimate to be obtained of the few cases in which 50% of the air quality monitoring stations exceeded the attention level  (200 mug m**-**3) during the following day for at least one hour.  22 Refs.

Title: Confidence measures for spoken dialogue systems
Abstract: This paper provides improved confidence assessment for detection of  word-level speech recognition errors, out of domain utterances and  incorrect concepts in the CU Communicator system.  New features from  the speech understanding component are proposed for confidence  annotation at utterance and concept levels.  We have considered a  neural network to combine all features in each level.  Using the data collected from a live telephony system, it is shown that 53.2% of  incorrectly recognized words, 53.2% of out of domain utterances and  50.1% of incorrect concepts are detected at a 5% false rejection  rate.  In addition, the confidence measures are used to improve the  word recognition accuracy.  Several hypotheses from different speech  recognizers are compiled into a word-graph.  The word-graph is  searched for the hypothesis with the best confidence.  We report a  14.0% relative word error rate reduction after this confidence  rescoring.  8 Refs.

Title: Multi-stream ASR trained with heterogeneous reverberant environments
Abstract: A common problem with current automatic speech recognition (ASR)  systems is that the performance degrades when it is presented with  speech from a different acoustic environment than the one used  during training.  An important cause is that the feature distribution to which the ASR system is trained no longer matches that of a new  environment.  Reverberant environments can be especially harmful.  In  this work, we test a multi-stream system in which the constituent  streams are each trained in separate acoustic environments.  When  training the acoustic modeling stages of the streams separately with clean data and heavily reverberated data, we find that the combined  system can improve the ASR performance with unseen reverberated test data.  10 Refs.

Title: Adaptive fuzzy logic controller
Abstract: This paper describes background and design of a model free adaptive  Fuzzy Logic Controller.  Controller Error Scaling Factor adaptation  uses principle of balancing Error and Change of Error actions.   Adaptation proceeds only if prescribed set of conditions is  satisfied.  Controller Scaling Factor for Change of Output adaptation uses weighted average of correction from oscillation index and  process steady state gain estimates.  Interaction between Scaling  Factor of Output adaptation and Scaling Factor of Error adaptation  has been alleviated by applying different adaptation speed for the  two parameters and by using corrective calculations.  The distinctive feature of the tuner design is simplicity.  Simulation test results  verify tuning properties for set point changes over a range of  changes of the process dynamics.  12 Refs.

Title: Lamp-modelling, from the measurement to the simulation model
Abstract: The electrical characteristics of fluorescent lamps requires  controlled output circuits for dimmable ballasts.  An advanced  controller design, which applies the traditional controller theory,  has to be based on a mathematical model of the fluorescent lamp.  In  this paper a new approach to model the dynamic behaviour of a  fluorescent lamp is introduced.  It builds on the well-known  behaviour of the positive column and adds the dynamic that occurs in the dimming process.  The input for the model is gained from direct  measurements on the lamp.  These measurements are fed into an  optimisation algorithm, which minimises a proposed model  uncertainty.  The yielded model can then be used for a systematic  controller design.  4 Refs.

Title: Application of a new Automatic Gauge Control system for the tandem  cold mill
Abstract: In July 2000, a new Automatic Gauge Control (AGC) system was  successfully installed at Kobe Steel's Kakogawa works.  The new AGC  system consists of two functions: multivariable AGC based on mass  flow thickness and roll eccentricity control.  The multivariable AGC  is designed using ILQ (Inverse Linear Quadratic) theory, a type of  optimal control theory, and controls both thickness and tension.   Repetitive control theory is applied to roll eccentricity control as roll eccentricity is a periodic disturbance related to the  rotational angle of the rolls.  The new AGC system has contributed to improved thickness accuracy and stable rolling.  In this paper,  details of the new AGC system are described and the application  results are shown.  4 Refs.

Moreover, the resulting iterative algorithm is quadratically  convergent.

Title: A new controller architecture for high performance, robust, and  fault-tolerant control
Abstract: In this note, we propose a new feedback controller architecture.  The  distinguished feature of our new controller architecture is that it  shows structurally how the controller design for performance and  robustness may be done separately which has the potential to  overcome the conflict between performance and robustness in the  traditional feedback framework.  The controller architecture includes two parts: one part for performance and the other part for  robustness.  The controller architecture works in such a way that the feedback control system will be solely controlled by the performance controller when there is no model uncertainties and external  disturbances and the robustification controller will only be active  when there are model uncertainties or external disturbances.  21  Refs.

Abstract: This note presents an H// infinity design approach for a neural  net-based control scheme.  In this scheme, a class of nonlinear  systems is approximated by two multilayer perceptrons.  The neural  networks are piecewisely interpolated to generate a linear  differential inclusion model.  Based on this model, a state feedback  control law is designed.  The H// infinity control is specified to  eliminate the effect of approximation errors and external  disturbances to achieve desired performance.  It is shown that  finding the permissible control gain matrices can be transformed to  a standard linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem and solved using  the convex optimization method.  14 Refs.

Title: Control of contact problem in constrained Euler-Lagrange systems
Abstract: Stabilization of an Euler-Lagrange system onto a constraint surface  when the system makes contact with a nonzero impact velocity is an  important problem in systems interacting with external environments.  Potential applications include robotic surface following and surface finishing operations in manufacturing industry.  In this paper, the  constrained dynamic equations are modeled as a set of nonsmooth  differential equations depending on whether the system lies on the  constraint surface or the system repeatedly makes and loses contact  with the constraint surface.  The focus is on the initial condition  problem, i.e., the system hits the constraint with a nonzero impact  velocity.  A new discontinuous control scheme is proposed that  ensures stable regulation of the system onto the constraint surface.  32 Refs.

Abstract: The problem addressed is the linearization of multi-input  multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems by a generalized state  coordinates transformation and generalized input-output injection,  in order to design an observer.  This observer will have linear error dynamics.  The goal is to bring together two observers design  approaches: a structural one and a numerical one.  Necessary and  sufficient conditions for the existence of a linearizing generalized state transformation are obtained by an algebraic way and without  computing the input-output differential equations.  The main result  tests integrability conditions of differential one-forms derived  from the state space representation and is applicable to a large  subclass of nonlinear systems.  22 Refs.

Abstract: High-precision miniature accelerometers based on electron tunneling  transducers have been successfully fabricated using bulk-silicon  micromachining process.  This process has been modified to reduce  bi-metal effects and results in greatly-suppressed 1/f noise.  A  comprehensive system model and a robust controller based on mixed mu synthesis have also been developed to close the feedback loop,  extend the bandwidth, and withstand accelerometer variations due to  micromachining process variations.  This accelerometer is a prototype intended for underwater acoustics applications and is designed to be packaged in an 8 cm**3 sphere volume with a total mass of 8 grams.   In this paper, we describe the accelerometer design, the feedback  control design, and several performance enhancements of these  micromachined tunneling accelerometers, which include a high  resolution of 20 nano-g/ root Hz and a 5 Hz-1.5 kHz bandwidth.  31  Refs.

Title: Control of a class of nonlinear discrete-time systems using  multilayer neural networks
Abstract: A multilayer neural-network (NN) controller is designed to deliver a  desired tracking performance for the control of a class of unknown  nonlinear systems in discrete time where the system nonlinearities  do not satisfy a matching condition.  Using the Lyapunov approach,  the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the tracking error and the NN weight estimates are shown by using a novel weight updates.   Further, a rigorous procedure is provided from this analysis to  select the NN controller parameters.  The resulting structure  consists of several NN function approximation inner loops and an  outer proportional derivative (PD) tracking loop.  Simulation results are then carried out to justify the theoretical conclusions.  The net result is the design and development of an NN controller for  strict-feedback class of nonlinear discrete-time systems.  12 Refs.

Title: Stabilization of nonlinear systems via forwarding mod left brace  L//gV right brace
Abstract: Forwarding is a tool for constructing stabilizers for nonlinear  systems.  A key step in this design technique is to find an explicit  solution to a partial differential equation (PDE), which may be hard to find-actually, the PDE may even not be solvable at all.  In this  brief note we show that it is possible to provide an additional  degree of freedom for the solution of the aforementioned PDE, hence  effectively extending the realm of application of the forwarding  methodology.  Our contribution is illustrated with the example of an  inverted pendulum with a disk inertia.  11 Refs.

Abstract: A differential linear matrix inequality (DLMI) approach is introduced for the solution of various linear continuous-time control problems.  The proposed method permits the application of linear matrix  inequalities (LMIs) to the solution of control design problems under uncertainty.  These problems are solved for finite horizon linear  systems while considerably reducing the overdesign inherent in  previous methods.  The new approach also allows for the solution of  the output-feedback control problem for systems belonging to a  finite set of uncertain plants with hardly any overdesign.  Four  examples are given to demonstrate the applicability of the new  method.  11 Refs.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of H// infinity filtering  for a class of linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems in which the  state-space matrices depend affinely on time-varying parameters.  We  employ the notion of affine quadratic stability using  parameter-dependent Lyapunov functionals.  We develop a linear  parameter-dependent filter such that the estimation erorr is  affinely quadratically stable with a prescribed performance measure.  It is established that the solvability conditions can be expressed  by linear matrix inequalities which are then evaluated at the  extreme points of the admissible parameter set.  Simulation results  of a typical example are presented.  14 Refs.

Title: Idle speed control of a direct injection spark ignition stratified  charge engine
Abstract: Idle speed control is investigated for a direct injection, spark  ignition, stratified charge (DISC) engine equipped with an  electronic throttle.  Such engines can be operated in multiple  combustion modes.  When operating in stratified charge combustion  mode, they are very different from conventional stoichiometric  engines, creating new opportunities for improved speed control.  With current after-treatment technology, simultaneous high fuel economy  and emissions conversion efficiency cannot be achieved by operating  the engine in a steady-state manner: it must be cycled between  running ultra-lean (for fuel economy) and rich (to service the  after-treatment system).  An idle speed control system is designed to meet the considerable feedback control demands required by these new engines.  27 Refs.

Title: On-board diagnosis for three-way catalytic converters
Abstract: On-board fault diagnosis is critical for the automotive industry.   Recently, new on-board diagnostic system requirements (OBD II) have  been enforced on California vehicles and new legislation will become stricter and stricter; moreover such requirements have also been  extended in Europe (EOBD).  Government regulations will require  monitoring vehicle emissions and alerting the driver if the exhaust  after-treatment system is not working properly.  To meet these  requirement, sophisticated diagnostic algorithms have to be  developed.  This paper presents a model-based stochastic approach for fault detection with application to automotive exhaust-gas  after-treatment systems.  The algorithm, based on relatively simple  control-oriented models of the three-way catalytic converter and the oxygen sensor, is suitable for real-time, on-board applications.  The overall strategy has been tuned and validated on the basis of  experimental data.  22 Refs.

Title: Intelligent feedback control-based adaptive resource management for  asynchronous, decentralized real-time
Abstract: We present intelligent feedback control techniques for adaptive  resource management in asynchronous, decentralized real-time  systems.  We propose adaptive resource management techniques that are based on feedback control theory and are designed using the  intelligent control design paradigm.  The controllers solve resource  allocation problems that arise during run-time adaptation using the  classic proportional integral derivative control function and fuzzy  logic.  We study the performance of the controllers through  simulation.  The simulation results indicate that the controllers  produce low missed deadline ratios and resource utilizations during  situations of high workloads.  12 Refs.

Title: Active steering systems based on model reference adaptive nonlinear  control
Abstract: This paper presents a model reference adaptive control strategy for  active steering of 2WS cars which is realized by steer-by-wire  technology.  The ideal fixed property of a steering system which is  provided by a reference model is attained by D* control.  The  proposed method can treat the nonlinear relationships between the  slip angles and the lateral forces on tires, and the uncertainties  on the friction of the road surface, whose compensations are proved  to be very important under critical situations.  Some results of  realtime simulation with a steering equipment show the effectiveness of the proposed method.  8 Refs.

Title: Adaptive controller design of MEMS gyroscopes
Abstract: A new angular rate-sensing scheme for z-axis MEMS oscillatory  gyroscopes, which is based on observer-based adaptive control, is  presented.  The proposed observer based adaptive control scheme  estimates the component of the angular velocity vector (z-axis),  which is orthogonal to the plane of oscillation of the gyroscope, as well as compensates friction forces, and fabrication imperfections,  which cause model parameter variations and the presence of  off-diagonal terms in the system's stiffness and damping matrix.  The convergence and resolution analysis presented in this paper shows  that the proposed observer-based adaptive controlled scheme offer  several advantages over conventional open-loop and closed-loop  sensing strategies, including a larger operational bandwidth,  producing no zero-rate output, the ability of self-calibration and a large robustness to parameter variation cause by fabrication defects and ambient conditions.  6 Refs.

Title: Practical dual-control guidance using adaptive intermitent maneuver  strategy
Abstract: A new adaptive intermittent maneuver strategy is proposed, which has  switching threshold levels dependent on the estimated time-to-go for dual-control guidance of passive homing missiles.  Guidance  performance in terms of control effort and target observability for  the adaptive intermittent maneuvers strategy are also analyzed, as  well as proportional navigation guidance.  With intermittent  maneuvers the guidance command is occasionally disabled to  intentionally increase guidance errors.  When provided with suitable  switching threshold levels, this intermittent maneuver strategy  improves target observability and, consequently, intercept  performance.  Statistical simulations for an atmospheric engagement  demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed intermittent maneuver  strategy.  16 Refs.

Title: Linear QFT control of a highly nonlinear multi-machine power system
Abstract: A quantitative feedback theory (QFT) method of Horowitz, treating  nonlinearities as equivalent disturbances, is applied to the linear  control of a multi-machine power system.  This system has a smooth  nonlinear dynamics so the original approach was simplified.  From the design point of view good results were obtained with simple  controllers (automatic voltage regulator, speed governor, power  system stabilizer) when the power system was affected by large load  variations and short circuits.  To reduce significantly the steady  state errors which appeared, a novel rotor speed error amplification scheme was employed.  This increased the autonomy of the controlled  power system to combat big distortions from normal operating  conditions.  20 Refs.

Title: Boundary control of a two-dimensional flexible rotor
Abstract: In this paper, we present the design of boundary controllers for a  two-dimensional, spinning flexible rotor system.  Specifically, we  develop a model-based boundary controller which exponentially  regulates the rotor's displacement and the angular velocity tracking error, and an adaptive boundary controller which asymptotically  achieves the same control objective while compensating for  parametric uncertainty.  As opposed to previous boundary control  work, which focused on the velocity setpoint problem and placed  restrictions on the magnitude of the desired angular velocity  setpoint, the proposed control architecture achieves angular  velocity tracking with no restrictions on the magnitude of the  desired velocity trajectory.  Experimental results conducted on a  flexible rotor tested are presented to illustrate the feasibility of implementing the proposed boundary control laws.  12 Refs.

Title: A hybrid specification method for the design of a workcell controller in manufacturing systems
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid specification method (HSM) for the  description and design of a workcell controller in a manufacturing  system.  This hybrid method integrates the top-down IDEF0 and  bottom-up statechart approaches.  The high-level functional  abstraction of a target system is first decomposed using IDEF0.   Statecharts of the overall system are then combined using  compositional constructs.  Programmable logic controller (PLCs)  programs that represent the low-level abstraction are finally  transformed from the statecharts.  To demonstrate the viability of  this method, an example of a workcell controller is designed using  this method.  The proposed method provides an alternative to the  traditional top-down decomposition technique with reusable and  extendable properties.  33 Refs.

Title: Induction motor control using load profiling measurement and  processing
Abstract: The paper describes development of an industrial grade prototype for  an induction motor control system.  Specifically the project looks at detecting unexpected increases in motor load, and developing  circuitry that will react appropriately before any damage is caused.  An increase in load is detected by tracking motor angular velocity  using Hall effect sensors.  A microcontroller filters the speed  measurements to reduce noise, and uses a clipping integrator on the  thresholded speed to reject outliers.  Experimental work was  undertaken to develop the control strategies and to ensure the  prototype was operating as required.  8 Refs.

Title: Relay based gain and phase margins PI controller design
Abstract: In this paper an iterative procedure for achieving gain and phase  margin specifications for a PI controller is presented.  The  iteration scheme is based on the use of two relay tests applied to  the closed loop system.  The first relay test is standard and it is  used here to obtain the gain margin of the closed loop system and  each iteration step.  The second one is applied to the closed loop  system such that a limit cycle is developed at the loop gain  crossover frequency.  Under this condition it is possible to obtain  an estimate of the phase margin of the loop transfer function.  The  procedure is applied to a PI controller tuning in a heat exchanger  in laboratory scale using desired gain and phase margin  specifications.  10 Refs.

Title: The development of a practical dexterous assembly robot system  without the use of force sensor
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a practical dexterous assembly robot system without the use of the force sensor.  This system is composed of  skill based control architecture and executes complex tasks such as  assembly of RV gear by combining some basic skill sets.  Among these  skill sets, Gear Mating Skill generating two kinds of characteristic rotary motions simultaneously is the most important skill for  achieving dexterous assembly tasks.  The goal state recognition of  this skill is made by using only internal position data of a robot.   This approach without using force sensor has made this system low  priced.  The effectiveness of this system is demonstrated through  MOTOMAN RV gear unit assembly tasks.  2 Refs.

Title: Optimal construction and control of flexible manipulators: A case  study based on LQR output feedback
Abstract: A mechatronic approach is studied here to design the mechanical  system and controller concurrently for a robotic flexible  manipulator.  There is no coupling effects among these components  which exit in traditional sequential design and this concurrent  development leads to the global optimal performance.  A linear  quadratic regulator with output feedback is used to compare the  results obtained from the traditional approach and this mechatronic  approach.  Using the mechatronic approach, optimal beam shapes as  well as the associated optimal controllers for different feedback  structures and for different objective functions can be achieved.   Numerical results have indicated substantial improvements on  performance.  (Author abstract) 15 Refs.

Abstract: We investigate how the frequency-dependent wave propagation  coefficient and complex modulus for a linearly viscoelastic material can be estimated from wave propagation experiments.  The strains at  different sections of a bar specimen are measured as functions of  time.  The time series are transformed into the frequency domain,  where a non-parametric identification is made.  A thorough analysis  of the quality of the non-parametric estimate is made, in which  approximate expressions for the covariance matrices of the wave  propagation coefficient and the complex modulus are derived.  The  validity of these expressions are confirmed by numerical studies and real experiments.  (Author abstract) 13 Refs.

Abstract: In this paper, a method to construct complete rational orthonormal  model sets with prescribed asymptotic order is presented for  continuous-time systems.  Two special cases that illustrate the  application of the method are studied.  In the first case, this  method is shown to produce the generalized Laguerre functions which  form a complete model set for H//2 and have asymptotic order two.  In both cases, this method is equivalent to calculating Toeplitz  determinants generated by a rational function.  The latter problem is reduced to finding solution of a linear finite-difference equation.   (Author abstract) 12 Refs.

Abstract: In the general framework of hydraulic servo systems, this paper  addresses the problem of position control in the presence of  important friction nonlinearities.  The accent falls on the variable  structure methodology, as we try to use its intrinsic robustness  properties.  Several friction observers, including the one based on a variable structure approach, were incorporated and tested in an  acceleration feedback control.  Next, we present a novel  implementation of a variable structure controller, which lumps  friction and load as an external disturbance.  Results of extensive  experimental testing encourage the use of variable structure methods in a class of highly nonlinear hydraulic servo systems.  (Author  abstract) 10 Refs.

In this note, the circle criterion and the Popov criterion are recast in an even more general setting; one which accommodates both  types of perturbations in the linear plant.  Numerical examples are  provided to illustrate the application of these frequency domain  tools.  (Author abstract) 14 Refs.

In this brief communication, we derive a  necessary condition in the discrete-time case, which cannot be  formulated in phase terms, and which is more stringent than the  condition of the robust SPR problem, thereby establishing a  fundamental difference between both continuous-time and  discrete-time domains.

Title: Robust nonlinear controller with voltage regulation
Abstract: A robust nonlinear controller for improving multi-machine power  system transient stability as well as achieving voltage regulation  is presented in this paper.  The controller is a direct feedback  linearization (DFL) controller with a PI type voltage servo  compensator.  The DFL controller is used to alleviate the  nonlinearities and interconnections in multi-machine power systems.   A design method is proposed to guarantee the stability of the whole  system and achieve voltage regulation simultaneously.  Using the  proposed approach, measurement of power angle is not necessary for  implementing the decentralized nonlinear controller.  Simulation  results of the proposed scheme on example systems show that the  damping and stability of the system are improved in a large  operating region.  (Author abstract) 17 Refs.

Unlike previously reported  controllers, this controller remains highly effective under a wide  range of processing conditions which will excite the nonlinear modes of the process.  Simulation examples are provided to highlight the  effectiveness of the control system.  (Author abstract) 13 Refs.

Abstract: The main contribution of this paper is a theorem to guarantee uniform global asymptotic stability (UGAS) and uniform local exponential  stability (ULES) for a class of nonlinear non-autonomous systems  which includes passive systems.  These properties (and a uniform  local Lipschitz condition) guarantee robustness of stability while  weaker properties, like uniform global stability plus global  convergence, do not.  Our main result is then used in the tracking  control problem of mechanical systems and ships.  We use an adaptive  backstepping design and prove UGAS of the closed-loop tracking error system, in particular, we obtain that both the tracking and  parameter estimation errors converge uniformly globally to zero.

Abstract: Control of well pumps in open-loop heat pump systems is a topic that  has been largely overlooked in related literature Three primary  methods in use are dual set point, variable speed, and multiple well (normally employed when multiple wells are required for hydrologic  or redundancy).  This paper explores the issues involved in the dual  set point method.  Establishing the system operating set points  requires consideration of peak loop loads, loop thermal mass, well  pump motor cycling limitations, and heat exchanger performance.   Guidelines for pump controller operating range are presented along  with the method of establishing the optimum loop temperatures at  peak load conditions.  3 Refs.

Title: Repetitive controller design in parameter space
Abstract: A new and simple repetitive controller design procedure in controller parameter space is presented here.  The structure of the filters in  the repetitive controller are fixed from the start and parameters  within these filters are tuned using the design method.  This  approach results in simple and physically meaningful controllers  that are easily implementable.  The design method is based on mapping frequency domain performance specifications to controller parameter  plane.  Sensitivity function magnitude bounds and a relative  stability measure are chosen as the frequency domain specifications  to be mapped into controller parameter space here.  The design method is illustrated numerically in the context of a servohydraulic  material testing machine application available in the literature.  27 Refs.

Abstract: A development effort has been embarked on with the goal of improving  the automation of some key components of NASA's Deep Space Network.

This change to the DSN's operational  scenarios should have an impact on future developments for all  components of the DSN.  3 Refs.

Title: A globally stable scheme for spacecraft control in the presence of  sensor bias
Abstract: In this paper we developed a globally stable scheme for bias  estimation in the case of attitude stabilization.  Our scheme is  based on the development of nonlinear observers for bias  identification and state estimation.  In the case of gyro bias, our  nonlinear observer design is based on the angular velocity dynamics.  It is shown that a suitable parametrization leads to an error model  and adjustment laws that result in guaranteed asymptotic convergence of the state estimation error to zero.  This, in turn, assures that  the stabilization objective is achieved asymptotically.  The efficacy of the algorithm is illustrated through numerical simulations.  8  Refs.

Abstract: Autonomous control systems will play a larger and larger role in  manned space flight.  These autonomous control systems will make the  crew more independent of ground support, thus reducing operation  costs.  However, for autonomous control systems to be effective, they must allow for insight by crew members and they must also allow crew members to work jointly with and even intervene in autonomous  activities.  We call this adjustable autonomy.  In this paper we  present the basic principles of adjustable autonomy and describe  three NASA projects in which adjustable autonomy was explored.   Conclusions are drawn from these projects.  10 Refs.

Title: Nonlinear adaptive guidance considering target uncertainties and  control loop dynamics
Abstract: This paper proposes a new nonlinear adaptive guidance law.  The fourth order state equation for integrated guidance and control loop is  formulated considering target uncertainties and control loop  dynamics.  The state equation is further changed into the normal form by nonlinear coordinate transformation.  A nonlinear adaptive  guidance law is proposed to compensate the uncertainties in both  target acceleration and control loop dynamics.  The proposed law  adopts the sliding mode control approach with adaptation for unknown bound of uncertainties.  The present approach can effectively solve  the existing guidance problem against target maneuver and the  limited performance of control loop.  We provide the stability  analyses and demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme through  simulations.  19 Refs.

Abstract: This paper addresses the control oriented formulation of structures  interacting thorough moving contact points.  The example used for  illustration is the dynamic interactions of moving vehicles and  bridges structure.  Such systems are time varying due to the moving  vehicles.  The system representation can be partitioned into time  invariant part (bridge and vehicle dynamics) and time varying part  (moving contact points).  Such system's approach facilitates  modularized analytical model development, analysis, simulation, and  control system design.  Block diagram based simulation with integral  causality will be presented to demonstrate the utility of this  approach for parametric investigation of the system dynamics.   Further, it will be shown that such problem can be put into the  linear parameter varying (LPV) standard feedback form to exploit the available theoretical and numerical tools.  16 Refs.

The second  contribution of this paper is the extension and implementation of  the STC method for two control inputs.  In bang-bang control  calculations it is usual practice to consider all possible  combinations of the switching and then carry out the computations  with a large set of switching parameters.  We introduce a novel  scheme for the switching times for two inputs which results in far  fewer switching parameters to calculate.  16 Refs.

Title: Solution of a differential game formulation of military air  operations by the method of characteristics
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a zero-sum differential game formulation  for the control of military air operations.  The model consists of a  system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the dynamics of the operations and a suitably chosen quadratic payoff function.   Control variables are engagement intensities and velocities, and  there are constraints on the controls.  The method of characteristics (based on the Pontryagin maximum principle) is used to solve the  associated Hamilton-Jacobi equation.  The Hamiltonian in this  nonlinear formulation can be explicitly optimized with respect to  the controls.  Numerical simulations study the enforcement of  constraints a) by means of penalties in the payoff function or b)  explicitly.  The numerical results show robustness with respect to  various parameters.  2 Refs.

Besides,  the rotor resistance estimator is also designed to cope with the  problem of the fluctuation of rotor resistance.  Stability analysis  based on Lyapunov theory is also performed to guarantee that the  controller design here is stable.  Finally, the computer simulations  and experiments are done to demonstrate the tracking performance of  our design subject to maximum power transfer.  7 Refs.

Title: Distributed autonomous control of concurrent combat tasks
Abstract: This article discusses the use of decentralized model predictive  control to manage a set of related combat tasks (e.g., the  destruction of anti-aerial defenses in a given geographical area by  a wing of uninhabited air vehicles (UAVs)).  The controller is meant  to operate autonomously as it attempts to manage conditions in which success in all its objectives cannot be guaranteed at every step.  It is also meant to work in a distributed fashion.  This implies that  complete knowledge of the state of each task is not needed at the  central level.  The approach presented suggests a way of aggregating  battle information to be used at the higher levels of command.  The  aggregation used is based on combat models and physical concepts and does not rely on arbitrary valuations of assets and targets.  5 Refs.

Title: Emergency braking control with an observer-based dynamic tire/road  friction model and wheel angular velocity information
Abstract: A control scheme for emergency braking of vehicles is designed.  The  scheme utilizes a LuGre dynamic friction model to estimate the  tire/road friction.  The control system output is the pressure to the braking system, and is calculated using only the wheel angular speed information.  The controller utilizes estimated state feedback  control to achieve near maximum deceleration.  The state observer  gain is calculated by using linear matrix inequality (LMI)  techniques.  This system has two advantages when compared with an  antilock braking system (ABS), it generates less chattering during  braking and produces a source of a priori information regarding safe spacing.  11 Refs.

Title: Integrated vehicle control via coordinated steering and wheel torque  inputs
Abstract: A controller was developed to govern the lateral position of a  highway-speed vehicle using frequency-weighted coordination of front steering and torque inputs.  The MISO design problem was recast as a  SISO approach by using a cascaded design technique: the first step  determined the relative contribution of each control input as a  function of frequency; secondary design steps utilized classical  SISO approaches.  For the vehicle control problem, the torque  steering inputs were designed to act only as high-frequency inputs,  while standard front steering was weighted for DC and low-frequency  inputs.  This controller was then tested on an experimental vehicle  system.  15 Refs.

Therefore the notion of Lie sequences is introduced,  facilitating the calculation of Taylor-Lie series, significantly.   Since the resulting coefficient can be expressed in terms of the  matrix exponential, numerical algorithms for the determination of  each coefficient can be used.

Abstract: A recently proposed blended multiple model system which employs  velocity-based local linear models is applied to Continuous Stirred  Tank Reactor (CSTR) plant.  Three important practical issues are  investigated: appropriate blending of the local models, obtaining  the input derivative and suitable choice of weighting functions.   Comparison is made with a conventional multiple model system of  affine local models.  Simulation experiments illustrate and confirm  previous analytical results on the dynamical modelling superiority  of the velocity-based local model network.  Furthermore, since the  underlying local models of the velocity-based system are  continuous-time and linear, continuity is now provided with  established linear theory.  11 Refs.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of suboptimal stable mixed  H//2/H// infinity control for linear time-invariant systems.  The  designed controllers are required to satisfy a prescribed H//  infinity performance bound or a prescribed degree of stability.  By  reducing the stable controller synthesis problem to a multiobjective state feedback control problem for two different state models,  sufficient conditions for the solvability of the considered problem  are given in terms of solutions to algebraic Riccati equations and  matrix inequalities.  LMI-based iterative algorithms are developed to solve the stable controller synthesis problem.  All of the proposed  algorithms are shown to be convergent.  An example is given to  illustrate the proposed methods.  18 Refs.

Abstract: A two input real time feedback adaptive controller for the electron  cyclotron resonance (ECR) CF//4/O//2 plasma etching of plasma  enhanced chemical vapor deposited (PECVD) silicon nitride thin films is designed and simulation tested.  Variations in etch rate resulting from factors such as etch chamber wall seasoning which are inherent  to plasma etching necessitate the use of feedback and adaptive  control to achieve precise and reliable etching of ultra-thin films.  In this paper, an adaptive controller is designed which maintains a  constant desired etch rate by adjusting the microwave power which  drives the plasma and a throttle valve which determines the pressure in the etching chamber.  The controller is tested using a simulation  based upon laboratory empirical data.  6 Refs.

Title: Design, fabrication and dynamic analysis of a PZT-actuated silicon  suspension
Abstract: A silicon suspension, suitable for use in a piezo-electrically  actuated dual-stage servo system for magnetic Hard Disk Drives  (HDDs), has been designed, fabricated and partially tested on the  rotating disk.  The suspension has an integrated gimbal structure and features that are useful for attaching PZT  (Pb(Zr//xTi//1//-//x)O//3) strips.  Under a 30 V applied voltage, the PZT strips stretch the suspension, producing an effective 1.3 mum  magnetic head radial motion.  The suspension has an in-situ  piezoresistive film, which produces a signal proportional to the  in-plane suspension bending.  This signal can be used as an  additional relative position error signal, which greatly improves  the robustness of the track-following HDD servo.  Micro-fabrication  techniques, suitable for fabricating this high performance  one-pieced silicon suspension, are also presented.  12 Refs.

Title: Concept, implementation, and control of wide bandwidth MEMS  gyroscopes
Abstract: This paper reports a novel concept for designing wide-bandwidth  micromachined gyroscopes with improved robustness.  The approach  suggest the use of two independently oscillating interconnected  proof masses to form a 4-DOF dynamical system, and thus increasing  the design parameter space of the inertial system.  The concept is  implemented using MEMS technology.  Computer modeling of the proposed design indicates over 15 times increase in the bandwidth of the  system as compared to the conventional gyroscopes.  In addition,  significantly reduced sensitivity of the gyroscope to structural and thermal parameter fluctuations and damping is demonstrated.  By  utilizing the disturbance-rejection capability of the inertial  system, improved robustness is achieved without sophistication in  control electronics.  All these advantages of the proposed design  might relax strict fabrication tolerances and packaging  requirements, reducing production cost of micromachined gyroscopes.   6 Refs.

Title: UIO for fault detection in vector second order systems
Abstract: The purpose of this manuscript is to construct natural observers for  vector second order systems by utilizing unknown input observer  (UIO) methods.  This observer will subsequently be used in a robust  fault detection scheme and also as an adaptive detection scheme for  a certain class of actuator faults wherein the time instance and  characteristics of an incipient actuator fault are detected.   Stability of the adaptive scheme is provided by a  parameter-dependent Lyapunov function for second order systems.   Numerical example on a mechanical system describing an automobile  suspension system will be used to illustrate the theoretical  results.  27 Refs.

Title: Effects of structural modeling on seismic performance estimation of  controlled steel structures
Abstract: The determination of seismic demands on a structure are based on  several assumptions concerning the structural parameters and  modeling.  The response of any structure depends on careful selection of those parameters so as to capture the significant effects of the  structure.  The focus of this study is to evaluate the effect of  selected parameters on the demand estimation of a controlled  structure under severe seismic demands.  The parameters investigated  here are: 1) the level of nonlinear modeling and analyses of the  structure, 2) the initial stiffness of the structure, and 3) the  strain-hardening assumptions in force-deformation relationships of  the elements.  8 Refs.

Title: Reliable output-feedback controller design for discrete-time linear  systems: An iterative LMI approach
Abstract: This paper studies the reliable output-feedback controller design for discrete-time linear systems based on the iterative linear matrix  inequality (LMI) approach.  The design goal is to find an internally  stability controller such that the nominal performance of a  closed-loop transfer matrix is optimized (minimized).  The designed  controller also satisfies the reliability constraint (in terms of  stability and performance) under the actuator/sensor faults  conditions.  Both the reliable H// infinity and the mixed H//2/H//  infinity control problems are considered.  A numerical example is  given to illustrate the new design methods and benefits.  7 Refs.

Title: State estimation and nonlinear model predictive control of end-use  properties in batch reactors
Abstract: There are economic incentives in controlling the end-use properties  in batch reactors to reduce the variability in the final product  quality specifications.  Here we define an approach for controlling  the properties within a desired target region, instead of a set  point, with an economic objective and with consideration of the  model uncertainty.  The approach to handling process-model mismatch  is based on determining the uncertainty in the predicted final  values of the properties, in the form of elliptical confidence  regions.  The controller then ensures that the complete confidence  region is within the target region.  A semi-infinite programming  problem is solved to find the input values for the rest of the  batch.  The methods developed here are demonstrated on an emulsion  polymerization example.  8 Refs.

Title: Robustness improvement in multi-rate state estimation
Abstract: A method of robust, nonlinear, multi-rate, state estimator design is  presented.  It can be used to improve robustness in an existing  estimator or design a new robust estimator.  An expression that can  be used to calculate an upper bound on the maximum sampling period  and time delay of infrequent measurements, is presented.  The upper  bound is the latest time at which the next infrequent measurements  should arrive to ensure that estimation error does not exceed a  desired limit.  A binary distillation flash tank is considered to  show the application and performance of the estimator.  15 Refs.

Title: Batch-to-batch optimization of PSD in emulsion polymerization using a hybrid model
Abstract: This work presents a hybrid modeling approach for batch-to-batch  optimization of particle size distributions (PSD) in semi-batch  emulsion polymerization.  A fundamental population balance model  describing PSD evolution is augmented by a Partial Least Squares  (PLS) model.  This hybrid model is then embedded in a successive  quadratic program (SQP) to design surfactant and initiator input  trajectories that drive the process to a target PSD.  PLS using a  moving batch data history, in which earlier batches are dropped from the data set as more recent batches are added, leads to superior  convergence compared with an expanding data set.  9 Refs.

Title: Dynamic controller synthesis guaranteeing L//2-gain for  time-controlled switched systems
Abstract: Design of control systems with discrete switches of their continuous  dynamics has been receiving much attention recently as an important  issue of control engineering.  In this paper, a controller synthesis  approach is proposed for switched systems with providing performance analysis of L//2-gain of switched systems.  Piecewise differentiable  storage functions are utilized to derive linear matrix inequalities  (LMIs) for performance analysis and controller synthesis.  State  jumps of the controller responding to switches of plant dynamics are exploited to improve control performance.  Numerical examples are  provided to illustrate the proposed synthesis method.  10 Refs.

Title: Adaptive output feedback tracking control of multiple spacecraft
Abstract: In this paper, an adaptive, output feedback control design  methodology is presented for a multiple spacecraft formation flying  (MSFF) system.  A Lagrangian derivation of the MSFF model is  considered to produce position dynamics for follower spacecraft #n  relative to follower spacecraft #(n - 1), assuming that the leader  spacecraft in the formation follows a no-thrust, natural, elliptical orbit.  Next, a control law is designed to provide a filtered  velocity measurement and a desired adaptive compensation with  semi-global, asymptotic, relative position tracking.  The proposed  control law is simulated for the case of two and three spacecraft  and is shown to yield semi-global, asymptotic tracking of the  relative position errors.  16 Refs.

Title: H// infinity controller for vehicle lateral control under fault in  front or rear sensors
Abstract: This paper presents the design of lateral controllers for automated  vehicles under specific sensor fault.  The specific fault refers to  the failure of one of the two sets of sensors on-board the vehicle  which are critical to vehicle lateral control.  The aim of the  controller design is to accomplish sound performance with the  remaining set of sensors.  The current vehicle lateral controller,  which works with the two sets of sensors, is examined and its  ineffectiveness under sensor failures is described.  Controllers with one set of sensors are designed using the H// infinity optimal  control theory.  Two controllers are derived, each using one set of  the two sets of sensors.  Simulation results are presented to  demonstrate the effectiveness of the controllers.  7 Refs.

Title: Combination of feedforward and feedback H// infinity control for  speed scheduled vehicle automatic steering
Abstract: This paper presents speed scheduling of H// infinity controllers for  vehicle lateral control.  Control synthesis uses a linear vehicle  model which includes the yaw and roll motion and is based on loop  shaping and robust feedforward H// infinity optimization.  The  synthesis procedure allows the separate processing of the robust  stabilization and the rejection of measured disturbance.  The  feedforward part processes the road curvature signal and is designed to achieve robust disturbance rejection.  The state feedback-observer form of the controllers is used for speed scheduling using robust  interpolation.  The synthesized controllers are tested for lane  keeping maneuvers and disturbance rejection at different speeds and  road conditions.  9 Refs.

Title: Antiskid control for aircraft via extremum-seeking
Abstract: A novel method of antiskid control for transport aircraft is  proposed.  After robustly stabilizing the hydraulics using an  inner-loop controller based on feed-back linearization and H//  infinity theory, a sinusoidal signal of small amplitude is injected  into the brake pressure to estimate, in real-time, tire-runway  friction properties.  This information is used by the algorithm to  keep the friction coefficient slightly less than the maximum allowed by the runway conditions.  This results in much smoother braking  compared to controllers currently in operation, which try to reach  the maximum.  Consequently, passenger comfort will be improved and  component wear will be reduced, while achieving comparable or better stopping performance.  In some cases, several hundred feet of  improvement in stopping distance is possible, as demonstrated via  realistic simulations based on a detailed model of the MD-90  aircraft.  22 Refs.

Title: Switching observers for continuous-time and discrete-time linear  systems
Abstract: An approach to estimation for continuous-time and discrete-time  linear systems is proposed that is based on the idea of using  switching observers.  Convergence conditions have been found to  ensure the stability of the error dynamics; in addition, they  guarantee the existence of an upper bound to a quadratic cost  function of the estimation error.  The observer gains may be selected by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).  A method is  described to design a switching observer that aims to minimize the  upper bound to the estimation cost function.  Moreover, such a design may be efficiently accomplished by using an LMI algorithm.  19 Refs.

Title: Distributed control for distributed linear parameter varying systems
Abstract: This paper considers stability analysis and performance control for  distributed systems with time and spatial varying parameters.  The  distributed linear parameter-varying (LPV) system depends on the  parameters in linear fractional transformation form.  The parameters  are assumed measurable in real-time for controller use.  By adopting  and preserving the spatial structure of the plant, the controller  will have localized architecture, which can be implemented using  parallel processors.  Using full block multipliers, the stability  property of the distributed parameter varying systems is guaranteed  by a structured Lyapunov function.  Moreover, it was shown that the  distributed LPV control algorithm can be determined through convex  optimization as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).  18 Refs.

Title: Control of flexible structures governed by the wave equation
Abstract: A new method of noncollocated controller design for flexible  structures, governed by the wave equation, is proposed.  The first  step is deriving the transfer function of the system and noticing  that it contains dead time, which represents the delay between  actuator excitation and noncollocated sensor measurement.  The  controller design consists of two stages.  In the first one, an inner collocated rate loop is closed in order to improve system damping.   The optimal rate gain is obtained by investigating the poles of the  full order transfer function.  In the second step an outer  noncollocated loop is designed to achieve high performance  characteristics.  At this stage an observer-predictor control scheme  for compensating the response delay is applied.  12 Refs.

Title: Control of hysteresis in a monolithic nanoactuator
Abstract: This paper deals with the characterization and control of hysteresis  in a piezoelectric nanoactuator.  First, the notion of normalized  ratio is introduced to quantitatively measure the strength of the  hysteresis.  This ratio is based on the harmonic contents of the  actuator output signal and is approximately invariant under a range  of input signal frequency and amplitude.  Second, an analytic  expression relating the harmonics to the plant parameters is  derived.  This expression is then applied to determine the plant  parameters so that a nonlinear observer can be synthesized to cancel the hysteresis.  Third, the observer-based compensated is tested in  the experimental system.  It is determined that the proposed  compensation scheme produces significant attenuation of the  hysteresis in the actuator.  5 Refs.

Title: Performance predictable design of robust motion controllers for  high-precision servo systems
Abstract: In this paper, a performance predictable design method of robust  motion controllers for high-precision servo systems is proposed.  A  stabilizing control input is designed based on Lyapunov redesign for the system in the presence of uncertainty and disturbance.  And  robust internal-loop compensator(RIC) is proposed based on the  internal model following control.  Using the structural  characteristics of the proposed RIC, disturbance attenuation  properties and the performance of the closed-loop system determined  by the variation of controller gains are analyzed.  Through this  analysis, in some specific applications, it is shown that if the  control gain of RIC is increased by N times, the magnitude of error  is reduced to its 1/N.  9 Refs.

Title: Robust repetitive controller design with improved performance
Abstract: This paper presents the design of a digital repetitive controller  with improved performance via discrete-time mu-synthesis technique.   The performance improvement at the fundamental frequencies is  obtained by a modified low-pass q(z,z**-**1) filter structure and  robust stability is obtained through mu-synthesis design  methodology.  The new structure of q(z,z**-**1) filter is motivated  by efforts to square the sensitivity function which has very small  values at the fundamental frequencies.  This paper includes a robust  repetitive controller design example for an electrohydraulic system  for the noncircular cam turning process.  Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed design.  12 Refs.

Title: Application of process control loop benchmarking to an oil production platform
Abstract: A complex system usually comprises numerous loops that are controlled by local SISO controllers.  The decision to retune or replace any one of these controllers should be based on an investigation as to  whether a change will improve the performance.  Such a procedure is  referred to as benchmarking.  With a benchmarking tool, the engineer  can justify a proposed retuning of the controller, since it provides a measure for the quality of control achieved.  In this paper, first, the basic theory on minimum variance control is presented.  Then, the results that are arising from this theory, and directly applicable  to benchmarking, are given.  Finally, application of the given ideas  to an industrial example, namely a Separation Vessel in an Oil  Platform, is described.  5 Refs.

Title: Run-to-run control of DC-sputtering processes
Abstract: A new nonlinear model is proposed for describing the relationship  between the relevant inputs and outputs of a DC-magnetron sputtering system used in a manufacturing line for digital-compact discs and  other optical data-storage devices.  It is shown that the process is  intrinsically discrete, and that it has an inherent transport delay.  A control scheme is proposed consisting of a Smith predictor to  address the delayed dynamics, and a globally linearizing operator  introduced to address the nonlinear nature of the model.  The control structure requires knowledge of two model parameters, namely, the  maximum film reflectivity and the characteristic-energy factor of  the sputterer, and makes use of one tuning variable, namely, the  parameter of an integral-only controller.  The performance of the  control system is illustrated via a simulation study.  10 Refs.

Title: Design of globally asymptotically stable nonlinear observers using  Lyapunov functions
Abstract: In this paper we will present a new method for the design of  nonlinear observers using Lyapunov functions.  We assume the system  in observable normal form already known from the literature.  Based  on this normal form the observer design will be carried out.  In  related work some assumptions regarding the nonlinearities are  usually made, e.g., lipshitzness or global boundedness.  We will show that a very weak growth condition, namely, montone decreasing  behaviour with respect to some variables will enable us to construct globally asymptotically stable observers using an appropriate  Lyapunov function.  An example which illustrates the power of these  new design conditions will conclude the paper.  3 Refs.

Title: Nonlinear reduced-order state and parameter observer
Abstract: A globally stable algorithm for jointly estimating the state and  parameters in deterministic nonlinear dynamic systems is developed.   This is accomplished by combining the concepts developed by Raghavan for the design of a full-order adaptive observer with the techniques used by Friedland for development of reduced-order estimators.  The  result is a new method whose applicability exceeds that of many  existing techniques in that it can accommodate multi-output systems.  Several previously developed methods applicable to the same class of nonlinear system are restricted to single-output systems.  In  addition, the new method is shown to have some computational  advantages.  10 Refs.

Title: Iterative learning control with Smith time delay compensator for  batch processes
Abstract: How to improve the control of batch processes is not an easy task  because of modeling errors and time delays.  In this work, novel  iterative learning control (ILC) strategies, which can fully use  previous batch control information and are attached to the existing  control systems to improve tracking performance through repetition,  are proposed for SISO processes which have uncertainties in modeling and time delays.  The dynamics of the process are represented by  transfer function plus pure time delay.  The stability properties of  the proposed strategies for batch processes in the presence of  uncertainties in modeling and/or time delays are analyzed in the  frequency domain.  Sufficient conditions guaranteeing convergence of  tracking error are stated and proven.  Simulation and experimental  examples demonstrating these methods are presented.  15 Refs.

Title: Spatial resonant control with collocated piezoelectric  actuator/sensor pairs
Abstract: This paper introduces a class of resonant controllers for minimizing  vibrations of flexible structures using collocated piezoelectric  actuator-sensor pairs.  The controller minimize the resonant  responses of a chosen number of vibration modes.  The controller  structure is chosen such that the closed loop stability is  guaranteed.  The controller is designed to minimize the spatial H//2  norm of the closed loop system, so that it guarantees average  reduction of vibration throughout the entire structure.  Controller  parameters are determined via Lagrange multipliers optimization  technique.  The proposed controller is validated experimentally to a  simply-supported beam to show the controller effectiveness in  controlling selected vibration modes.  14 Refs.

Title: Bounded output feedback control of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation  with input constraints
Abstract: This work focuses on the stabilization of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky  equation (KSE) with periodic boundary conditions at the zero  solution in the presence of input constraints.  Bounded nonlinear  stabilizing controllers are synthesized on the basis of  finite-dimensional Galerkin approximations of the KSE which capture  the dominant dynamics of the equation for a given value of the  instability parameter.  The controller design accounts explicitly for the presence of input constraints and an explicit characterization  of the limitations imposed by the input constraints on the allowable control actuator locations is provided.  The theoretical results are  successfully illustrated through computer simulations of the  closed-loop system using a high-order discretization of the KSE.  19  Refs.

Title: Fluid mixing by feedback in Poiseuille flow
Abstract: We address the problem of enhancing mixing by means of boundary  feedback control in 2D channel flow.  This is done by first designing feedback control strategies for the stabilization of the parabolic  equilibrium flow, then applying this feedback with the sign of the  input reversed.  The result is enhanced instability of the parabolic  equilibrium flow, which leads rapidly to highly complex flow  patterns.  Simulations of the deformation of dye blobs positioned in  the flow indicate (qualitatively) that effective mixing is obtained  for small control effort as compared with the nominal (uncontrolled) flow.  A mixedness measure P//epsilon is constructed to quantify the  mixing observed, and is shown to be significantly enhanced by the  application of the destabilizing control feedback.  34 Refs.

One is trained off-line to approximately invert the  nonlinear dynamics of etching plant, and the other, which is capable of on-line learning, is used to dynamically cancel the inversion  error.  Stability analysis is provided using the Lyapunov method, and a weight adjustment rule for the on-line learning neural network is  derived that can guarantee closed-loop stability.  9 Refs.

Title: Stabilizing a linear system by switching control with dwell time
Abstract: The use of networks in control systems to connect controllers and  sensors/actuators has become common practice in many applications.   This new technology has also posed a theoretical control problem of  how to use the limited data rate of the network effectively.  In this paper, we consider a system where its sensor and actuator are  connected by a finite data rate channel.  A design method to  stabilize a continuous-time, linear plant using a switching  controller is proposed.  In particular, to prevent the actuator from  fast switching, or chattering, which can not only increase the  necessary data rate but also damage the system, we employ a  dwell-time switching scheme.  It is shown that a systematic partition of the state-space enables us to reduce the complexity of the design problem.  27 Refs.

Title: A novel MultiBlock method using latent variable partial least squares
Abstract: It has been demonstrated when applying multivariate statistical  techniques to industrial plants, with large numbers of process  variables distributed into several process units, that it can often  be beneficial to apply the algorithms to sub-sets of the process  variables.  This approach has been termed multiblock and procedures  exist for applying the technique to both Principal Component  Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS).  In this paper a  modified form of multi-block PLS(MBPLS) is presented.  Application of this algorithm to a simulated de-isobutaniser suggests that for this system, the proposed algorithm provides greater fault detection and  isolation capabilities than traditional MBPLS approaches.  14 Refs.

Title: A convex characterization of classes of problems in control with  specific interaction and communication structures
Abstract: We present a list of optimal disturbance rejection problems in  systems in which the overall control scheme is required to have a  certain structure.  These structures correspond to various classes of controlled systems which include what we refer to as nested,  chained, hierarchical, delayed interaction and communication, and,  symmetric systems.  The common thread in all of these classes is that by taking an input-output point of view we can characterized all  stabilizing controllers in terms of convex constraints in the  Youla-Kucera parameter.  The disturbance rejection problem can  therefore be casted as a convex, yet nonstandard, model matching  problem.  Approaches that solve this problem are presented for  various optimality criteria.  19 Refs.

Title: Fixed and adaptive model-based controllers for active queue  management
Abstract: In this paper we present new model-based controllers for active queue management (AQM) supporting TCP flows.  Our control design is based  on linearization of a previously developed TCP model using fluid  flow and stochastic differential equations.  An AQM using a simple PI controller is shown to significantly outperform RED AQM.  However, we show that both AQMs are unable to maintain performance as the number of flows increases.  To overcome this, we introduce a special type of adaptation, the externally excited adaptive loop (EEAL) controller.   In comparison to the PI AQM, the EEAL AQM exhibits faster response  to flow changes, and is able to give a dynamic estimate of the  number of flows.  12 Refs.

Title: Sensitivity and robustness properties in the preview control of  linear non-minimum phase plants
Abstract: Non minimum phase zeros limit the achievable performance and  robustness of a feedback control loop.  These limitations can be  expressed as an upper limit on the bandwidth that may be achieved  without necessarily incurring a large peak in closed loop  sensitivity.  In the case of preview control, it is known that  advance (or anti-causal) knowledge of the reference to be tracked  permits accurate, rapid tracking over bandwidths which exceed the  normal performance limits.  The first aim of this paper is to explain apparent paradox.  In addition, we briefly discuss sensitivity and  robustness issues for preview control systems.  19 Refs.

Title: H// infinity control of differential algebraic equation systems: The  linearizing change of variables approach revisited
Abstract: In this paper control of high index or even non-regular linear  differential-algebraic-equation systems subject to H// infinity  performance constraints is considered.  In a previous paper left  bracket 8] this problem was addressed by a linearizing  change of variables approach under a certain assumption on the  structure of the algebraic equations within the system description.   This restriction is overcome in the paper at hand.  By means of a  modified linearizing change of variables approach to the H//  infinity control problem, the synthesis conditions (given as linear  matrix inequalities (LMIs)) not only become structurally simpler,  but, in contrast to [8] , also include the  case without algebraic constraints.  10 Refs.

Title: Input-output linearisation of nonlinear systems with ill-defined  relative degree: The ball & beam revisited
Abstract: In this note it is established that for SISO systems lack of  well-defined relative degree is not an obstacle to exact inversion.   Sufficient conditions for the existence of exact linearising inputs  are established.  Exact tracking solutions of a number of example  systems, including the ball and beam system studied by Hauser and  others, are analysed.  It is shown that linearising inputs may be (i) highly non-unique (ii) discontinuous and include impulses etc.,  (iii) fragile.  A framework is established for approximate  linearisation whereby exact linearising inputs are formulated as the limits of sequences of realisable, arbitrarily accurate linearising  inputs.  This framework is constructive in nature and of key  importance when the exact linearising inputs are, for example,  unrealisable.  5 Refs.

The concept can reduce the trial and error needed to obtain a good design by more  clearly showing the relationship between the open-loop and  closed-loop frequency responses.

Abstract: This paper discusses the design of adaptive feedforward control for  dual stage servo system in disk drives, which utilizes vibration  signal obtained from instrumented suspension, in order to compensate track mis-registration (TMR) due to air flow excited suspension  vibration.  Experiments are conducted on a spin stand to evaluate the TMR due to air flow excited suspension vibration using LDV.  Adaptive feedforward control is designed to cancel suspension vibration, by  using the strain signal on the surface of the instrumented  suspension, and controlling slider with a MEMS microactuator (MA).   An off-line MA model identification method, which does not utilizes  relative position sensing is also proposed.  Simulations show the  proposed technique can successfully suppress the suspension  vibration induced TMR.  8 Refs.

Title: A state-space based design of generalized minimum variance controller equivalent to transfer-function based design
Abstract: This paper proposes a new generalized minimum variance controller  (GMVC) using state-space approach.  The controller consists of a  state feedback and a reduced-order observer with poles at z = 0. A  coprime factorization of the state-space based controller is also  obtained.  It is shown that the GMVC designed by state-space approach is equivalent to the GMVC given by solving Diophantine equations and polynomial approach.  The equivalence is proved by comparing coprime  factorizations of the two controllers.  From the results of this  paper, it may be possible to apply advanced design schemes given by  state-space control theory to the design of GMVC.  7 Refs.

Title: Organically-structured control
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to propose a study of the following  control problem: Given a complex interconnected system, determine  autonomous decentralized control laws which stabilize the system  despite structural perturbations whereby subsystems are disconnected and again connected in various ways during its lifetime.  The  underlying assumption is that subsystems (overlapping or disjoint)  are made of structural elements connected to at least one  intelligent element (controller); they are either multiple  controller or multiple plant configurations.  Disconnected structural or intelligent elements are no longer considered to be integral  parts of the system.  A distributed intelligence over interconnected  complex structures imitates what goes on in the biological world,  and we initiate a systematic investigation of the problem of  Organically-Structured Control (OS-control) which can stabilize the  system under structural perturbations and ultimately prevent a  system breakdown.  20 Refs.

Abstract: This paper presents a robust control method for uncertain nonminimum  phase systems with external disturbances.  A systematic design  algorithm is developed which links the sliding mode control and the  root locus technique.  Complete closed-loop pole placement is  achieved in addition to the placement of the reduced order  equivalent system poles.  An integration function is employed in the  sliding variable formulation.  The output tracking error is  guaranteed to vanish.  The proposed method was successfully applied  to control the angle of attack of a missile attitude control system.  16 Refs.

Title: Nonlinear boiler model of 300MW power unit for system dynamic  performance studies
Abstract: The nonlinear dynamic boiler model of 300MW power unit is given which is derived from mass and energy balance relationship.  The parameters of the model can be obtained from the physical dimensions and  characteristics of the boiler.  The inputs of the model are feedwater valve position, steam valve position, fuel valve position, and  feedwater temperature, the outputs of the model are drum pressure,  water level, main stream flow.  The model can be used for synthesis  of model-based control algorithms of boiler system.  It can also be  used for setting up a real-time simulator for testing new boiler  control system and operator training.  6 Refs.

Title: Design and verification of supervisory controller of high-speed train
Abstract: A high-level controller, supervisory controller, is required to  monitor, control, and diagnose the low-level controllers of the  high-speed train.  The supervisory controller controls low-level  controllers by monitoring input and output signals, events, and the  high-speed train can be modeled as a discrete event system (DES).   The high-speed train is modeled with automata, and the high-level  control specification is defined.  The supervisory controller is  designed using the high-speed train model and the control  specification.  The designed supervisory controller is verified and  evaluated with simulation using a computer-aided software  engineering (CASE) tool, ObjectGEODE.  9 Refs.

Title: Development of onboard train automatic control system for Korean  standard EMU
Abstract: The automatic/driverless operation which are great important  techniques in metro railway are required to increase higher safety,  greater reliability, and transport capacity.  To satisfy such  demands, we must have the system design and testing technique for  the railway system operation.  These techniques are related to the  onboard train control and communication systems which include  TCMS(Train Control and Monitoring System), ATO(Automatic train  Operation), ATC(Automatic train Control), and TWC(Train to wayside  communication).  These sub-systems must be interfacing with not only  each other but also the signal system on the ground.  We tested the  train control system on Seoul subway 7 line that has been developed  on the basis of the standardized type EMU for Korean railway  systems.  8 Refs.

Title: Guaranteed cost LPV output-feedback controller design for nonlinear  systems
Abstract: This paper proposes a guaranteed cost linear parameter-varying(LPV)  output-feedback controller for nonlinear systems.  Interpolating a  nonlinear system into an LPV system associated with time-varying and state-dependent weighting functions, i.e. the gain-scheduled  parameters, allows one to apply various linear system theories and  techniques for analyzing and synthesizing nonlinear systems.   Consequently, with the real-time measurable time-varying parameters, this paper presents an affine type of linear parameter-dependent  output-feedback controller, i.e. an LPV controller, for the given  LPV plant.  And as a cost, we shall consider an upper bound of states and input energy called LQ performance, under all admissible grades  of the gain-scheduled parameters.  This approach is more flexible for the nonlinear systems than existing approaches in the literature  because the other controllers excessively depend on the structure of the nonlinear systems.  13 Refs.

Title: Game optimal receding horizon guidance laws and its equivalence to  receding horizon guidance laws
Abstract: In this paper, a game optimal receding horizon guidance law (GRHG) is proposed, which does not use information of the time-to-go and  target maneuvers.  It is shown that by adjusting design parameters  appropriately, the proposed GRHG is identical to the existing  receding horizon guidance law (RHG), which can intercept the target  by keeping the relative vertical separation less than the given  value, within which the war-head of the missile is detonated, after  the appropriately selected time in the presence of arbitrary target  maneuvers and initial relative vertical separation rates between the target and missile.  8 Refs.

Title: Disturbance observer-based digital control for single-phase ups  inverters
Abstract: Design and analysis of disturbance observer-based deadbeat control  for single-phase inverter applications are comprehensively presented in this paper.  Load current can be estimated by disturbance  observer, which is basically structured with the first order  equation in this case and is regarded as a relatively simple method  in comparison with conventional full-order Luenberger observer.   Also, an inherent one-step delay problem appeared in the deadbeat  control method is overcome by a simple prediction technique  proposed.  Output voltage dip is reduced by the feedforward control  with the change rate of the estimated load current involved in the  deadbeat current control loop.  The proposed algorithms are verified  by the respective simulation and experiment results.  7 Refs.

Title: The design of PIDA controller with pre-compensator
Abstract: In this paper, PIDA(Proportional, Integral, Derivative, Acceleration) for high order system control is simulated.  The PIDA controller  design is suggested by Jung & Dorf and Shunju Manabe.  In the Jung &  Dorf Method, rising time is rapid, but large overshoot is occured at the rising time.  Using the CDM(Coefficient Diagram Method) of Shunju Manabe, overshoot does not occur, but rising time is very slow.   Therefore, in this paper, a Pre-Compensator is proposed to improve  with Jung & Dorf Method for decreasing the overshoot at the rising  time.  The controller performance was estimated applied to AC  Induction Motor in this paper.  11 Refs.

Title: Exact orbital stability analysis of static and dynamic ramp  compensations in DC-DC converters
Abstract: Exact orbital stability of static linear, static quadratic, and  dynamic ramp compensations in current mode control for DC-DC  converters is considered.  On static linear ramp compensation, a  well-known stability criterion is re-examined.  This stability  criterion, based on inductor current dynamics, is shown to be an  approximate and necessary (but not sufficient) condition for system  stability.  A new approach based on sampled-data modeling is proposed to determine the right ramp slope to stabilize the system.  On static quadratic and dynamic ramp compensations, new stabilization schemes  are proposed, without changing the nominal steady-state condition.   16 Refs.

Title: Design of fuzzy logic controller for HVDC using an adaptive  evolutionary algorithm
Abstract: This paper presents an optimal design method for fuzzy logic  controller (FLC) of HVDC using an Adaptive Evolutionary Algorithm  (AEA).  We propose an AEA, which uses a genetic algorithm (GA) and an evolution strategy (ES) in an adaptive manner to take merits of the  two different evolutionary algorithms.  We use AEA to tune fuzzy  membership functions and scaling constants.  Simulation result shows  that disturbances are well damped and the dynamic performances of  FLC have the better responses than those of PD controller when AC  system load changes suddenly.  14 Refs.

Title: Point-to-point control of elastic joint robots dynamic output  feedback passification approach
Abstract: Motivated by the dynamic output feedback passification results, a  point-to-point control law for an elastic joint robot is presented  when only the position measurements are available.  This provides an  alternative way of replacing the role of the velocity measurements  for the proportional-derivative (PD) feedback law.  The proposed  methodology makes a parallel connection of the robot system and an  input-dimensional linear system which obtains the effect of the  desired differentiators.  It is shown that the closed-loop nonlinear  robot system satisfies the sufficient conditions for passification  and the regulation as well as the passivity of the system is  achieved in the end.  The performance of the proposed control law is  illustrated in the simulation studies of a manipulator with three  revolute elastic joints.  26 Refs.

Title: An approach to anticontrol of chaos for a discrete-time TS fuzzy  system
Abstract: An approach is proposed for making a given stable Takagi-Sugeno (TS)  fuzzy system chaotic by using state feedback control of arbitrarily  small magnitude.  The feedback controller chosen among several  candidates is a simple sinusoidal function of the system states,  which can lead to uniformly bounded state vectors of the controlled  system with positive Lyapunov exponents, and satisfy the chaotic  mechanisms of stretching and folding, thereby yielding chaotic  dynamics.  This approach is mathematically proven for rigorous  generation of chaos from a stable TS fuzzy system, where the chaos  is in the sense of Li and Yorke.  A numerical example is included to  visualize the theoretical analysis and the controller design.  20  Refs.

Title: The design of sliding mode controller with perturbation observer for  a 6-DOF parallel manipulator
Abstract: This study proposes the sliding mode controller with perturbation  observer for a 6-DOF parallel manipulator in the presence of  nonlinear and uncertainty terms.  The controller is based on Lyapunov approach and the perturbation observer is based on the fuzzy  adaptive network.  This observer utilizes the control input for  compensating unmodeled dynamics terms and disturbance.  And, the  weighting parameters of the fuzzy adaptive network are updated  on-line by adaptive law in order to force the estimation errors to  converge to zero.  Therefore, the combination of sliding mode control and fuzzy adaptive network gives rise to the robust and intelligent  routine.  For evaluating control performance of the proposed  approach, tracking control simulation is carried out for a 6-DOF  parallel manipulator.  17 Refs.

The controller is  designed to have the robust tracking property of the cable engine  under disturbances.  The performance of the designed controller is  evaluated by computer simulation, and consequently, a feasibility  study for laying the submarine cable stably is done through  analyzing simulation results.  4 Refs.

Title: Design of PLCs for automated industrial systems based on discrete  event models
Abstract: Ladder diagrams (LDs) have been widely used in industrial control  systems as a programming language for programmable logic controllers (PLCs).  However, the synthesis of LD itself mainly depends on the  experience of the industrial engineer, which often results in  unstructured or inflexible design.  Hence, in this paper, we propose  a ladder diagram transformation (LDT) algorithm which systematically produces LDs for PLCs based on discrete event models (DEMs) to  enhance the structured and flexible design mechanism.  Moreover, the  LDT algorithm is convenient and easy to be implemented.  The LDT  algorithm is illustrated by considering the control of a point to  point (PTP) control system.  8 Refs.

Title: Performance enhancement of a class of nonlinear nonminimum phase  systems by adaptive observer
Abstract: An adaptive observer scheme for estimation of unknown disturbances in a nonlinear non-minimum phase time-invariant, single-input  single-output control system is proposed.  It is assumed that the  disturbances are generated by a system with unknown parameters,  which are identified by the adaptive observer.  The design is based  on coprime factorization of the plant model over the ring of stable  rational functions.  Comparison between adaptive observers for  strictly positive real plant and the proposed scheme is shown, as  well.  The stability of the overall system is proved.  The  effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified through simulation  examples.  11 Refs.

Title: A structured framework for the modeling and control of modular  machining centers
Abstract: In the paper, the problem of defining a structured methodology for  the modeling and design of the control system for machining centers  is addressed.  In particular, It is shown how object-oriented  modeling technique can be usefully exploited for the definition of  two basic reference models, one for the plant to be controlled and  one the control functions.  The proposed framework includes proper  hierarchical composition, formal representations, and compliance  with international control standards, which are useful In the  perspective of design.  The paper shows the application of such  concepts to an Industrial large machining center for prismatic  workpieces.  14 Refs.

Title: Vehicle stability control responsibility improvement using steer-by-wire
Abstract: With the aim of improving vehicle stability through the introduction of active steering control, the authors undertook the development of a Steer-by-Wire (SBW) system that obtains a better effect than that of DYC (Direct Yaw-moment Control) while avoiding interference with driver steering.  With current control, vehicle stability control begins only after a change in vehicle behavior has been detected, and therefore in the case of full braking test on a mu -split road and in other situations requiring high responsiveness, the vehicle stabilizing effect is lowered by the lag time until the control starts, and residual yaw angle after the vehicle stopping is created, among other problems.  In order to resolve these problems, a new type of control was developed whereby the driver's steering intent is detected based on DYC behavior and front-wheel angle controlled based on deviation between front-wheel rotational speeds. It was verified by on-vehicle testing that the addition of this control results in greater vehicle stability

Title: GMUGLE: A goal lattice constructor
Abstract: Goal lattices are a method for ordering the goals of a system and  associating with each goal the value of performing that goal in  terms of how much it contributes to the accomplishment of the  topmost goal of a system.  This paper presents a progress report on  the development of a web-based implementation of the George Mason  University Goal Lattice Engine (GMUGLE).  GMUGLE allows a user to  interactively create goal lattices, add/delete goals, and specify  their ordering relations through a web-based interface.  The database portion automatically computes the GLB and LUB of pairs of goals  which have been entered to form them into a lattice.  Yet to be  implemented is the code to input goal values, automatically  apportion the values among included goals, and accrue value among  the included goals.  1 Refs.

Title: A framework for creating customized multi-modal interfaces for XML  documents
Abstract: The eXtensible Markup Language(XML) is emerging as a new way to store and communicate data.  Even though its primary application is as the  future of the World Wide Web, it can be used in a variety of  situations to structure electronic data.  As XML becomes ubiquitous,  there is a need to develop tools to allow users to view, navigate,  and modify the underlying XML data via a high-level, multi-modal  interface.  Moreover, because XML can be used in a variety of  situations, the tools must allow a user to access the data via  non-traditional interfaces.  The web, eCommerce, and digital  classrooms are all possible applications for XML.  This paper  presents a framework for developing multi-modal tools to view,  navigate, and modify XML structures.  10 Refs.

Title: Extending databases to support image editing
Abstract: In order to understand similarity between images, recent research has focused on adaptable searches and fuzzy queries.  However, one of the best means for determining similarity between images is to know how  the image was created.  If the image is a combination of other images in the database, then there is a great deal of similarity between  the base images and the created one.  This requires extending the  database to support image editing operations.  We have built a  preliminary system which does this by using a web-based image editor and a image server.  The editor and the server understand a logical  model language that represents images.  This paper then explores the  issues of performance for deriving images from a sequence of  operations.  12 Refs.

It is clear that the role of WWW in this context is a cornerstone as the medium of information dissemination.  A trend in e-commerce is to provide to the potential customers the ability to view and "try" the products in a persuasive 3D representation.  We have designed and  implemented a system for WWW enabled interactive design &  visualization of a room, definition of pieces of furniture and  placement of domestic appliances.  The system conveys a generic  approach for distributed creation and update of virtual worlds as  means of interaction and information dissemination in an e-commerce  context.  6 Refs.

Title: Networked virtual environments for the Web: The Webtalk-I &  Webtalk-II architectures
Abstract: Networked Virtual Environments (Net-VE) are a class of applications  which allow for cooperation between multiple users within a  three-dimensional representation of an environment.  We have  developed a general platform - WebTalk-I - which allows the creation of any of these environments with easy accessibility via the web,  and fully provides for third party authoring.  After several  experiments with different applications deployed using this  technique (among these, the Italian National Science Museum), we  analyzed user response and usage data, in order to design a new  architecture - WebTalk-II - for an improved class of Net-VEs.   WebTalk-II will be able to generate 3D Worlds dinamically based on a database with all major 3D formats, defines different sets of  cooperation metaphors within users, and will be entirely written in  Java.  We describe both architectures, assessing their flaws and  advantages.  10 Refs.

Title: E-commerce direct marketing using augmented reality
Abstract: Turning Web customers from "window shoppers" into buyers demands an  interactive sales model that informs them, gives them individualized attention, and helps to close the sale at the customer's request.   Ideally, sales agents should have in-person meetings with all  prospective customers.  However, this may not be desirable or  feasible.  The next best thing is for sales agents to send  promotional e-mails to their prospective customers.  In this paper,  we describe the development of a direct marketing system that uses  augmented reality (AR) technology.  A set of specially designed  markers is used to calibrate the camera and track the motion of the  markers for the augmentation of three dimensional product models.   There is no special hardware required for this system except a PC  camera (e.g., WebCam or ViCAM).  8 Refs.

Smart  Device Servers (SDS) are key components of future communication  architectures designed to bridge proprietary information to an open  environment based on Ethernet and Web technology.  The SDS embeds a  set of services accessible by standard tools found in an IT  environment.  These services facilitate the management of plant floor devices during their whole life cycle.

Title: Managing field instrumentation using internet technologies
Abstract: Internet technologies, such as TCP/IP on Ethernet, have been growing  in popularity as methods of communicating with field  instrumentation.  A benefit of this trend is that several commercial  technologies using TCP/IP on Ethernet can provide advanced  management features within instruments.  Technologies such as the Web can provide easy access to devices from web browser software that is included in most operating systems.  This access can provide a simple management mechanism to alter calibration settings, review user  documentation, and update maintenance logs within a device.  This  management mechanism can significantly reduce maintenance costs and  increase ease-of-use.  Within some installations, TCP/IP on a  wireless link can replace Ethernet to further increase the benefits.  This presentation will include a demonstration of technologies that  facilitate field instrument management over TCP/IP on Ethernet and  TCP/IP on a wireless link.

Title: Rendering effective route maps: Improving usability through  generalization
Abstract: Route maps, which depict a path from one location to another, have  emerged as one of the most popular applications on the Web.  Current  computer-generated route maps, however, are often very difficult to  use.  In this paper we present a set of cartographic generalization  techniques specifically designed to improve the usability of route  maps.  Our generalization techniques are based both on cognitive  psychology research studying how route maps are used and on an  analysis of the generalizations commonly found in handdrawn route  maps.  We describe algorithmic implementations of these  generalization techniques within LineDrive, a real-time system for  automatically designing and rendering route maps.  Feedback from over 2200 users indicates that almost all believe LineDrive maps are  preferable to using standard computer-generated route maps alone.  29 Refs.

Abstract: Hypermedia structuring and navigation requires design methodologies  different from those developed for standard information systems.   This case study details our successful application of relationship  management methodology (RMM), a hypermedia systems analysis and  design methodology, to ACM SIGLINK's LINKBase.  LINKBase is a World  Wide Web (WWW) application, which dynamically generates WWW pages  from a relational database containing information about  hypermedia-related events such as conferences, publications,  authors, and sponsoring organizations.  We describe our experience  applying RMM in this case study, summarize design lessons we learned in the process, present extensions to RMM, discuss human-computer  interaction (HCI) aspects of RMM, and ground our work in the  hypermedia design and HCI literature.  Our experiences should  encourage hypermedia and WWW developers to utilize systematic design techniques to build highly usable and useful WWW applications.  57  Refs.

Low-strength  films such as PE or cast PP are coated with an adhesive and slit  into customer-sized rolls.  They are subject to permanent width loss  when are put under sufficient tension for good operability in a  slitter.  Razor blades can present sufficient drag on a web coated  with adhesive to thicken the caliper of the web edges.  These blades  should be oscillated, crossing through the plane of the web to  increase the amount of blade exposed in the cutting process.   However, the slitter bars have to be custom built as it is not  practical to use standard shear knife designs for cutting.  (Edited  abstract)

This effect can be used for different applications in  composites, ceramics and metal alloys.  However only the combination  of thermographs, ultrasound and radiography techniques can predict  physical parameters of material (density, thickness, modulus of  elasticity) and strength.  X-ray line sensors cameras have a  wavelength of 400-600 nm. and a high sensitivity for capturing  composite images.  X-ray cameras with CCD chips have been able to  convert light into video signals which is also suitable for video  microscopy.

Abstract: A critical overview of the use of the World Wide Web for education in general and computational physics education in particular is given.  Some strengths and weaknesses in teaching physics on the Web are indicated, with samples taken from the author's research group.  The Web is shown to be a natural for CP education. It is argued that the Web is useful elsewhere when the focus is kept on pedagogy and usability before technology, and when there is some way of imposing structural coherence, such as provided by a printed text or a course.  It is concluded that the best use of the Web is probably when it provides elements that would be difficult or impossible to obtain otherwise, and when it is intermixed with a human element

Title: Web-based electronic product cataloging
Abstract: Web-based electronic product cataloging (EPC/Web) refers to the use  of information technology (IT) such as database, multimedia and  Internet in compiling and providing product catalogs by  manufacturers and using and selecting products by customers.  The  resulting electronic product catalogs can be accessed through web  browsers on the Internet/intranet.  Paper-based product catalogs are  used manually and have limitations such as being difficult to update and tedious to search.  When they are replaced electronically, these  shortcomings are overcome and extra features are also provided to  aid the process of archiving and selecting product information.  This paper reports on an effort made to prototype an easy-to-use  web-based EPC system with sufficient cataloging functionally.  The  method of experience gained and lesson learn in developing this  prototype system are discussed.  17 Refs.

Title: Evaluating topic-driven web crawlers
Abstract: Due to limited bandwidth, storage, and computational resources, and  to the dynamic nature of the Web, search engines cannot index every  Web page, and even the covered portion of the Web cannot be  monitored continuously for changes.  Therefore it is essential to  develop effective crawling strategies to prioritize the pages to be  indexed.  The issue is even more important for topic-specific search  engines, where crawlers must make additional decisions based on the  relevance of visited pages.  However, it is difficult to evaluate  alternative crawling strategies because relevant sets are unknown  and the search space is changing.  We propose three different methods to evaluate crawling strategies.  We apply the proposed metrics to  compare three topic-driven crawling algorithms based on similarity  ranking, link analysis, and adaptive agents.  25 Refs.

Title: Enhancing security and privacy in biometrics-based authentication  systems
Abstract: Because biometrics-based authentication offers several advantages  over other authentication methods, there has been a significant  surge in the use of biometrics for user authentication in recent  years.  It is important that such biometrics-based authentication  systems be designed to withstand attacks when employed in  security-critical applications, especially in unattended remote  applications such as e-commerce.  In this paper we outline the  inherent strengths of biometrics-based authentication, identify the  weak links in systems employing biometrics-based authentication, and present new solutions for eliminating some of these weak links.   Although, for illustration purposes, fingerprint authentication is  used throughout, our analysis extends to other biometrics-based  methods.  23 Refs.

Title: Improved relevance ranking in WebGather
Abstract: The amount of information on the web is growing rapidly, and search  engines that rely on keyword matching usually return too many low  quality matches.  To improve search results, a challenging task for  search engines is how to effectively calculate a relevance ranking  for each web page.  This paper discusses in what order a search  engine should return the URLs it has produced in response to a  user's query, so as to show more relevant pages first.  Emphasis is  given on the ranking functions adopted by WebGather that take link  structure and user popularity factors into account.  Experimental  results are also presented to evaluate the proposed strategy.  8  Refs.

Title: Web log data warehousing and mining for intelligent web caching
Abstract: We introduce intelligent web caching algorithms that employ  predictive models of web requests; the general idea is to extend the least recently used (LRU) policy of web and proxy servers by making  it sensitive to web access models extracted from web log data using  data mining techniques.  Two approaches have been studied in  particular, frequent patterns and decision trees.  The experimental  results of the new algorithms show substantial improvement over  existing LRU-based caching techniques, in terms of hit rate.  We  designed and developed a prototypical system, which supports data  warehousing of web log data, extraction of data mining models and  simulation of the web caching algorithms. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Distributed web-based simulation experiments for optimization
Abstract: The web has grown tremendously over the past decade - with  applications in education, marketing, financial services, and supply chain management.  Web technology also has a significant impact on  computer simulation.  Most of the effort in web-based simulation is  aimed at modeling, particularly at building simulation languages and at creating model libraries that can be assembled and executed over  the web.  This paper focuses on efficiency of simulation  experimentation for optimization.  We introduce a framework for  combining the statistical efficiency of simulation optimization  techniques with the effectiveness of parallel execution algorithms.   In particular, a novel simulation sampling procedure, the Optimal  Computing Budget Allocation (OCBA) algorithm, is implemented in a  web-based environment for low-cost parallel and distributed  simulation experimentation.  A prototype implementation with some  experimental results is presented to show the viability of  web-enabled simulation environments. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  37 Refs.

Title: XML and security
Abstract: The XML Signature Working Group - a joint technical committee of the  Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web  Consortium (W3C) - aims at enabling digital signing of documents  using XML syntax.  This capability is critical for a variety of  electronic commerce applications, including payment tools.   Signatures can provide integrity. message authentication and/or  authentication services for data of any type, whether located within the XML that includes the signature or located elsewhere.  XML  signatures ate generated by a hash function from the collection of  references to the objects being signed; its syntax associates the  content of resources with a key via a strong one-way transformation.  This paper will provide further information on this and the proposed XML encryption standard.  16 Refs.

Title: Simulation evaluation of a heterogeneous Web proxy caching hierarchy
Abstract: This paper uses trace-driven simulations to evaluate the performance  of different cache management techniques for multi-level Web proxy  caching hierarchies.  In particular, the experiments consider  heterogeneous cache replacement policies within a two-level caching  hierarchy, and size-based partitioning across the levels of a  caching hierarchy.  Three different synthetic Web proxy workloads are used in the study, reflecting complete overlap, partial overlap, and no overlap in the workloads seen by the child-level proxies.  The  simulation results demonstrate that heterogeneous replacement  policies and size-based partitioning each offer modest improvements  in caching performance.  The sensitivity of the results to the degree of workload overlap is also discussed.  31 Refs.

Title: A simulation analysis of dynamic server selection algorithms for  replicated Web services
Abstract: A practical approach to the provision of responsive Web services is  based on introducing redundancy in the service implementation by  replicating the service across a number of servers geographically  distributed over the Internet.  In this paper we compare the user  perceived performance of three dynamic server selection algorithms  operating at the client side, in order to provide some guidelines  for adopting an algorithm that is appropriate for a given scenario.   All the three algorithms use small probes to assess the network  congestion and the server load before making a decision.  The first  algorithm downloads the whole requested Web page from a single  server, while the other two algorithms concurrently download  different pieces of the same requested Web page from different  servers.  The analysis is conducted via simulation with AEMPA/Two  Towers.  10 Refs.

Title: Improving ensemble-TCP performance on asymmetric networks
Abstract: For the Worm Wide Web, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and  the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) are two important protocols.   However, interactions between these two protocols, combined with the bandwidth asymmetry of network access technologies such as ADSL, can lead to inefficient HTTP/TCP performance.  This paper investigates  the effects of bandwidth asymmetry on Ensemble-TCP, a protocol  designed to coordinate multiple HTTP/TCP connections to improve Web  document transfer performance.  The evaluation is conducted using the ns-2 network simulator.  The paper also proposes and evaluates two  new schemes, ACC-Ensemble and AF-Ensemble, to improve Ensemble-TCP  performance on asymmetric networks.  The simulation results show that AF-Ensemble and ACC-Ensemble perform better (often 10-50% faster)  than Reno TCP and Ensemble-TCP for typical user-level Web browsing  activity on asymmetric networks.  17 Refs.

Title: Software acquisition: A business strategy analysis
Abstract: This paper argues that there are new insights to be gained from a  strategic analysis of requirements engineering.  The paper is  motivated by a simple question: what does it take to be a world  class software acquirer? The question bas relevance for requirements engineers because for many organisations market pressures mean that  software is commonly acquired rather than developed from scratch.   This paper builds on the work of Fine [13]  who suggests that product, process and supply chain should be  designed together - 3D concurrent Engineering.  Using a number of  reference theories it proposes a systematic way of carrying out 3-D  concurrent engineering.  The paper concludes that the critical  activity in supply chain design is the design of the distribution of skills and the nature of contracts.  28 Refs.

Title: Strategies for condensing online text
Abstract: Online writing experts recommend that writers and editors write less  text when composing for the screen.  To do so effectively, writers  need specific strategies for condensing text that go beyond the  usual advice for clear, concise writing.  In addition, they should be cautious when advised to arbitrarily cut the word count in half, as  some experts suggest.  This paper offers strategies for condensing  online text that result in fewer words overall.  It also suggests  strategies for making online text seem shorter, even if the word  count remains unchanged.  This paper concludes by discussing the  risks of condensing text too rigorously.  Providing complete  information with nothing extraneous requires knowing not only what  readers need, but what they do not need.  11 Refs.

Title: Careful scientific writing: A guide for the nitpicker, the novice,  and the nervous
Abstract: Writing scientific documentation has a unique set of caveats,  pitfalls, and red flags that other types of writing do not have.  The very nature of scientific writing demands the precise use of words  and phrases, however, this precise usage is often discounted as  being pedantic by many people.  The reason for this precision is to  communicate sometimes highly technical information to others who  may, or may not, be as knowledgeable as the author, and who may, or  may not, be a native speaker of the language in which the author is  writing.  To do this, accurate words and phrases must be used,  especially in light of globalization and sciences that involve  multiple disciplines.  4 Refs.

Title: A brief history of technical communication
Abstract: Civilization is a cumulative enterprise, and communication has always been a vital component of that cumulation process.  From the  fourteenth century on, the social system of science has depended on  technical communication to describe, disseminate, criticize, use,  and improve innovations and advances in science, medicine, and  technology.  Rapid change in technical communication has been obvious during the past few decades with the advent of computers, laser  printers, the Internet, and other developments, Viewed from a  historical perspective, those changes can be seen as but a portion  of the evolution that technical communication has undergone.  It has  undergone vast changes in the means and methods that it employs and  in the audience to which it is addressed, the purposes to which it  is put, the roles it fulfills, and the social forces that drive and  support it.  20 Refs.

Title: Meeting others - Supporting situation awareness on the WWW
Abstract: World Wide Web (WWW) techniques provide a simple interface, which is  accessible almost everywhere.  The WWW supports document sharing and  information retrieval, but has no tools for direct user interaction, simply because the mechanisms to support user awareness are missing.  The aim of this paper is twofold.  First, we present general concepts of situation awareness, which concerns the user interaction on the  WWW platform, and a theoretical framework, which is used in  examining existing awareness support systems.  Second, we provide an  analysis of PeopleAwarenessEngine, which supports situation  awareness and enables user communication and collaboration on the  WWW. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: CADMOS: An approach to developing Web-based instructional systems
Abstract: The educational use of the Internet and the World Wide Web has grown  enormously over the last few years and continues to grow at a  tremendous rate.  Instructional systems, based on these networked  technologies, have been constructed to solve instructional problems.  There is evidence that these systems efficiently support the  instructional process.  Instructional developers should follow  effective and quality driven development methodologies, which are  specifically developed to support the development of network-based  instructional systems.  This article presents a methodology, CADMOS,  which accords to the principles of the third and partially the  fourth generation of Instructional Systems Development (ISD).  The  main innovation of CADMOS is its advocacy on splitting an  instructional system into four sub-systems: human, webware, other  learning resources, and specific infrastructure sub-systems. copy  2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: The effect of extrinsic motivation on user behavior in a  collaborative information finding system
Abstract: In collaborative information finding systems, evaluations provided by users assist other users with similar needs.  This article examines  the problem of getting users to provide evaluations, thus overcoming the so-called "free-riding" behavior of users.  Free riders are those who use the information provided by others without contributing  evaluations of their own.  This article reports on an experiment  conducted using the "AntWorld," system, a collaborative information  finding system for the Internet, to explore the effect of added  motivation on users' behavior.  The findings suggest that for the  system to be effective, users must be motivated either by the  environment, or by incentives within the system.  The findings  suggest that relatively inexpensive extrinsic motivators can produce modest but significant increases in cooperative behavior.  25 Refs.

Title: Expert system of machining operation planning in Internet environment
Abstract: A framework for machining operation planning systems is discussed, in which machining know-how, extracted and organized from electronic tool catalogs and machining instance databases available in the Internet environment plays a principal role.  A system concept based on the use of reference machining instance data is proposed, which is derived from the investigation of tool catalogs, related international standards, reference textbooks, and handbooks.  The format is used partly during user input and database inquiry to extract required data effectively from the databases.  In developing system organization, WWW technology, including XML markup language and the Java programming language, is utilized.  A prototype system to advise the engineer of cutting conditions including trouble shooting for side end milling is developed to demonstrate the concept.  For a feasibility test, sample databases of tool catalogs and the machining instance data of heat resistant super alloys are implemented and used.  From the case studies, the concept and the implementation method are evaluated, and found to be practical and effective at the time the information infrastructure is established.

Title: XML with data values: Typechecking revisited
Abstract: We investigate the typechecking problem for XML queries: statically  verifying that every answer to a query conforms to a given output  DTD, for inputs satisfying a given input DTD.  This problem had been  studied by a subset of the authors in a simplified framework that  captured the structure of XML documents but ignored data values.  We  revisit here the typechecking problem in the more realistic case  when data values are present in documents and tested by queries.  In  this extended framework, typechecking quickly becomes undecidable.   However, it remains decidable for large classes of queries and DTDs  of practical interest.  The main contribution of the present paper is to trace a fairly tight boundary of decidability for typechecking  with data values.  The complexity of typechecking in the decidable  cases is also considered.  26 Refs.

Title: JavaBean-based simulation with operational procedure table (OPT)
Abstract: This paper describes an application of operational procedure table  (OPT) methodology to web/component-based simulation.  Component-based development, which permits use of drag and drop methods, can  significantly reduce development time since no coding is required.   Furthermore, an OPT component can enhance design efficiency with a  tabular format specification for describing the behavior of a  system.  OPT tabular display helps a user understand associations  between inputs and outputs.  We introduce the JavaBeans discrete  simulation (JBDS) system, which has a library of basic simulation  components and the OPT component, to illustrate the combination of  component/web-based simulation development and OPT.

Abstract: In studying actual Web searching by the public at large, we analyzed  over one million Web queries by users of the Excite search engine.   We found that most people use few search terms, few modified  queries, view few Web pages, and rarely use advanced search  features.  A small number of search terms are used with high  frequency, and a great many terms are unique; the language of Web  queries is distinctive.  Queries about recreation and entertainment  rank highest.  Findings are compared to data from two other large  studies of Web queries.  This study provides an insight into the  public practices and choices in Web searching.  (Author abstract) 16  Refs.

Title: Evolutionary algorithm performance profiles on the adaptive  distributed database management problem
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms have been shown to be effective in providing  configuration optimisation to dynamic load balancing in distributed  database systems and Web servers.  This paper explores the tuning  parameter performance profile of such techniques over a variety of  problems, including the adaptive distributed database management  problem (ADDMP), focusing on a range of interesting and important  features.  The ability of the evolutionary search process to reliably find good solutions to a dynamic problem in a minimal and consistent run-time is of paramount importance when considering their  application to real-time industrial control problems.  This paper  demonstrates the existence of certain optimal parameter values,  particularly for the rate of applied mutation, which are shown to  produce consistently good problem solutions in a low number of  evaluations with a minimum standard deviation.

Title: Web server workload forecasting in fuzzy environment - linguistic  approach
Abstract: Web server workload forecasting is one of the essential  considerations in web server management and network upgrading.  Due  to variability of server workload distribution originated from  unpredictable users' surfing behavior, the measurement of Web server performance metrics are characterized and modeled in fuzzy manner.  A fuzzy inference system is formed using four Web server performance  metric and server utilization index are derived to determine the  servers' utilization states for every time period(s).  A fuzzy Markov model is proposed to illustrate the state transitions of server  resource utilization based on experts' linguistically evaluation of  stationary transition probability.  A steady state algorithm is  applied to explore the convergence of server resource utilization  after n transition period(s).  (Author abstract) 13 Refs.

Title: Fuzzy linguistic decision analysis for Web server system future  planning
Abstract: Web administrators' prioritization of several upgrading alternatives  with respect to multiple contradictory criteria involve fuzziness  and impreciseness of human's subjective judgements in a Web server  system.  In this paper, fuzzy concepts are used to enhance the  traditional Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP) which are mainly applied in crisps decision environment.  The entropy weight proposed by  Don-Lin Mon is implemented to evaluate the upgrading alternatives  priority in a Web server system.  Fuzzy numbers act as a reference to indicate the influence strength of each element in the hierarchy  structure. alpha-cut-based method is utilized to prevent the  controversial of fuzzy number ranking process where the fuzzy  judgement matrix is reconstructed into an interval fuzzy judgement  matrix.  Fuzzy linguistic term approach is applied to capture the  fuzziness and subjectiveness of Web administrators' judgements.   (Author abstract) 13 Refs.

Abstract: Discrete event simulation can be used for virtual prototyping of new  manufacturing facilities.  Models built for this purpose must be easy to use, flexible, and provide a realistic graphical view of the  proposed system.  The DESTINY project has developed models of plate  processing operations to assist shipyards in modernizing their plate fabrication lines.  Configuration information for a proposed line is  collected via a Web interface, which then launches a program to  build and execute a simulation of the system.  Graphics images and  statistical reports are then returned to the user via the Web  interface.  The approach allows rapid analysis of technology  improvements and a visualization of proposed system operation.   (Author abstract) 5 Refs.

Abstract: The dominance of the Internet in the development of information and  communication technology has made Web-based distributed solutions  increasingly attractive.  Apart from providing other services, the  World Wide Web is being looked upon as an environment for hosting  modeling and simulation applications.  SIMAN is a simulation language that allows users to simulate discrete and continuous systems.  In  this research, a web-based interface or toolkit has been developed  for storing and executing SIMAN simulation models over the Internet.  This toolkit consists of a World Wide Web interface to SIMAN and a  web-accessible database for storing user models.  It provides users  an easy-to-use environment for developing text-based simulation  models using the SIMAN simulation language.  It also allows users to  test the functionality of a SIMAN model using the SIMAN debugger/run controller.  (Author abstract) 3 Refs.

Title: Java-based simulation manager for Web-based simulation
Abstract: This paper discusses a Web-based simulation manager program that  executes an Application Service Provider (ASP) event for a customer  who does not possess the in-house capability to program complex  simulations.  The utility in using this simulation manager is that  the customer needs results in near real-time; that is, approximately the time to run one complete replication of the simulation model  plus some overhead time to send the commands necessary to execute  the simulation and to process the results.  The simulation manager  executes simulation studies in a parallel replications format, using either designed experiments or optimization methodologies, by  sending the appropriate messages to a set of engine processors to  cause the execution of the prescribed simulation trials.  It then  receives and analyzes the simulation results produced by the  simulation engines, and sends a project report to the human  customer.  (Author abstract) 9 Refs.

Abstract: SLX by Wolverine software is actually one of the fastest simulation  languages.  Besides the high performance the SLX-compiler can be  extended very easily by user specific syntax rules and new basic  functions.  This  pyramid power' of SLX is used to build a new system for modeling and simulation - VisualSLX.  This system is a shell atop the standard SLX-compiler and the runtime system.  All model and  simulation data are stored in a universal database.  VisualSLX could  be used for a comfortable, rapid visual modeling and for remote  modeling and simulation through the internet without any knowledge  of the SLX-syntax and modeling paradigms.  This paper reveals the  architecture and the underlying data structures of the system.   Additional requirements and interfaces are caused by the application of VisualSLX as a web-based modeling and simulation system.  (Author  abstract) 6 Refs.

Abstract: We propose a novel method for using the World Wide Web to acquire  trigram estimates for statistical language modeling.  We submit an  N-gram as a phrase query to web search engines.  The search engines  return the number of web pages containing the phrase, from which the N-gram count is estimated.  The N-gram counts are then used to form  web-based trigram probability estimates.  We discuss the properties  of such estimates, and methods to interpolate them with traditional  corpus based trigram estimates.  We show that the interpolated models improve speech recognition word error rate significantly over a  small test set.  16 Refs.

Title: Automatic transcription of compressed broadcast audio
Abstract: With increasing volumes of audio and video data broadcast over the  web, it is of interest to assess the performance of state-of-the-art automatic transcription systems on compressed audio data for media  indexation applications.  In this paper the performance of the LIMSI  10x French broadcast news transcription system is measured on a  two-hour audio set for a range of MP3 and RealAudio codecs at  various bitrates and the GSM codec used for European cellular phone  communications.  The word error rates are compared with those  obtained on high quality PCM recordings prior to compression.  For a  6.5 kbps audio bit rate (the most commonly used on the web), word  error rates under 40% can be achieved, which makes automatic media  monitoring systems over the web a realistic task.  10 Refs.

Title: Fischlar: An on-line system for indexing and browsing broadcast  television content
Abstract: This paper describes a demonstration system which automatically  indexes broadcast television content for subsequent non-linear  browsing.  User-specified television programmes are captured in  MPEG-1 format and analysed using a number of video indexing tools  such as shot boundary detection, keyframe extraction, shot  clustering and news story segmentation.  A number of different  interfaces have been developed which allow a user to browse the  visual index created by these analysis tools.  These interfaces are  designed to facilitate users locating video content of particular  interest.  Once such content is located, the MPEG-1 bitstream can be  streamed to the user in real-time.  This paper describes both the  high-level functionality of the system and the low-level indexing  tools employed, as well as giving an overview of the different  browsing mechanisms employed.  11 Refs.

Comparative research indicates that introducing cooperative learning in university courses results  in higher student achievement and more positive attitudes toward the subject and teaching methodology.  Delivery of materials and learning activities via the Web provides greater access and flexibility for  students.  The students used a course management system (CMS) to  study the online portion of the course.  6 Refs.

Title: Approaches for capacity and revenue optimization in survivable WDM  networks
Abstract: In this paper, we consider two important objectives of network  operation: (i) capacity minimization and (ii) revenue maximization.   For capacity minimization, we formulate three operational phases in  survivable WDM network operation viz., initial call set up,  short/medium-term reconfiguration, and long-term reconfiguration.   All three phases are derived from a single integer linear  programming (ILP) formulation.  This common framework incorporates  service disruption.  We modify the framework for revenue maximization that includes a service differentiation model based on lightpath  protection.  We propose a multistage solution methodology to solve  individual service classes sequentially and combine them to obtain a feasible solution.  We provide cost comparisons in terms of increase  in revenue obtained by various service classes with the base case of accepting demands without any protection.  Results are provided to  demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.  19 Refs.

Abstract: Considering the characteristics of highly specialized corporation in  the construction industry, it's crucial to select appropriate  subcontractors to implement specific subprojects.  In this research,  the overall subcontracting supply chain of a construction project is considered as a global procurement system and an optimal combination of subcontractors can be obtained within this system.  Combining the  quick response mechanism of information technology with portfolio  theory in financial management, an integrated XML (eXtensible Markup Language) of Accelerated Subcontracting And Procuring (ASAP) model  was proposed.  The ultimate goal of this study is not only to develop a web-based decision support system for general contractors to  accurately decide an appropriate trade-off between risk and profit  for different combinations of subcontractors, but to take the  subcontracting and procuring process into re-engineering through  omnipresent Internet. copy 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: MPEG-7 and MPEG-7 audio - An overview
Abstract: For more than 10 years the term MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group)  has been synonymous with successful standardization in the field of  audiovisual coding.  The well-known standards MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and  MPEG-4 have defined the state of the art in the perceptual coding of multimedia content.  More recently the MPEG standards group (ISO/IEC  JTC1/SC29/WG11) has extended its traditional scope by initiating the MPEG-7 standardization process, which aims to define a unified  interface for the description and characterization of multimedia  content.  An overview of the goals, ideas, and concepts behind MPEG-7 is provided, with particular emphasis on the audio part of the  emerging standard.  20 Refs.

Title: Web based rSPC(realtime Statistical Process Control) system  supporting XML protocol
Abstract: Accurate process control in the manufacturing industry is essential  to survive in the competitive market.  Statistical process  control(SPC) system has been widely used to satisfy the  ever-increasing quality control requirements.  However, most  commercial products in the market are not flexible, semi-automatic,  and difficult to interface with other tools.  In this paper, we  propose an advanced rSPC(Real-Time SPC) system which is based on the web and supports XML protocol.  We also provide a powerful graphic  facility and an efficient file system to handle the data in real  time.  Even though the idea can be applied to any manufacturing  system, our system is optimized to the semi-conductor industry and  TFT/LCD industry.  The system is implemented in C++ and COM/DCOM, and shows a good result.  5 Refs.

Title: Document filtering boosted by unlabeled data
Abstract: This paper describes three learning methods for document filtering  that use unlabeled data.  The proposed methods are based on a  committee of the classifiers which are trained on a small set of  labeled data and then augmented by a large number of unlabeled data.  By taking advantage of unlabeled data, the effective number of  labeled data needed is significantly reduced and the filtering  accuracy is increased.  The use of unlabeled data is important  because obtaining labeled data is difficult and time-consuming,  while unlabeled data are abundant.  For all proposed methods, the  experimental results show that the accuracy is improved up to 9.2%  with only two-thirds as many labeled data as the method which does  not use unlabeled data.  14 Refs.

Title: Experiencies retrieving information in the World Wide Web
Abstract: this paper, using the information obtained from the daily working of  a Web directory, we attempt to expand the knowledge about the  behaviour of the users in order to improve and adapt the Internet  search engines to their users.  We have analysed more than 320,000  requests of the transaction log of a Spanish Web directory, focusing our attention, firstly, in the searches in order to confirm the main differences between Internet and traditional Information Retrieval  systems.  Furthermore, we have developed an exhaustive statistical  analysis of searches, categories visited and documents viewed to  achieve a mathematical pattern of behaviour for each one, and what  it is more important, to establish a relationship between the  variations in the behaviour of each one.  7 Refs.

Title: Dynamic group communication security
Abstract: If multicast communication appears as the most efficient way to send  data to a group of participants, it presents also more  vulnerabilities to attacks and requires services such as  authentication, integrity and confidentiality to transport data  securely.  In this paper, we present the protocol Baal as a scalable  solution to group key management problems and show how Baal resolves the user's revocation problem.  This protocol is based on  decentralized group key management with only one key shared among  group members.  We use then Network Simulator, ns-2, in order to  evaluate the performance of our protocol in the case of group  initialization, and compare it with SKDC approaches.  23 Refs.

Title: An adaptive and efficient clustering-based approach for content-based image retrieval in image databases
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)  approach, for image databases, based on cluster analysis.  CBIR  relies on the representation (meta-data) of images' visual content.   In order to produce such metadata, we propose an efficient and  adaptive clustering algorithm to segment the images into regions of  high-similarity.  This approach contrasts with those that use a  single color histogram for the whole image (global methods), or  local color histograms for a fixed number of image cells  (partition-based methods).  Our experimental results show that our  clustering approach offers high retrieval effectiveness with low  space overhead.  For example, using a database of 20,000 images we  obtained higher retrieval effectiveness than partition-based methods with about the same space overhead of global methods, which are  typically regarded to as storage-wise compact.  20 Refs.

Title: Web-based data capture and management in epidemiologic investigations
Abstract: Database management is an important aspect of epidemiologic studies  requiring understanding of the scientific problems under  investigation as well as a clear understanding of the formal data  processing required.  Failure to achieve this combination is not a  rare event.  To address this deficit, a database management process  was designed that allowed the epidemiologist investigator to focus  entirely on the survey or data capture instrument to be employed in  the study.  As that document is prepared, the database management is  automatically constructed so that there are no interpretative  errors.  This approach has been prepared in two formats. both  designed to function at the Internet These are the Data Base  Research (DBR) system and the Simplified Survey System (S3).  6 Refs.

Title: Evolutionary learning of Web-document structure for information  retrieval
Abstract: Web-documents have a number of tags indicating the structure of  documents.  The tag information can be utilized to improve the  performance of document retrieval systems.  In this paper, we propose an approach to retrieve Web-documents using HTML tags and then uses  a genetic algorithm to adapt the tag weights.  This method uses a  modified similarity measure based on the tag weights.  A genetic  learning method is used to select the tags for retrieval and get the optimal tag weights.  We evaluate our method via experiments on  conference pages and TREC document sets.  The experimental results  show that the tag weights are well trained by the proposed algorithm in accordance with the importance factors for retrieval.  The  proposed method has achieved about 10% improvement in retrieval  accuracy.  26 Refs.

Title: A neural visualization method for WWW document clusters
Abstract: Search engines are widely used for retrieving documents on the WWW.   Visualization is useful for users to understand the retrieval  results.  When the retrieved documents are represented as document  vectors, neural networks can be employed to visualize them.  In this  study, we consider the following two requirements for the  visualization algorithm.  One is that the cluster structure of  document vectors is preserved.  The other is that the visualization  algorithm is fast.  For these requirements, we employ basis function  networks.  Basis functions detect the cluster structure and weight  parameters are adjusted by a fast algorithm so that the distance  structure of the document vectors is preserved.  Experiments show  that our method is fast enough as an interface system.  9 Refs.

Title: Web-based image retrieval: A hybrid approach
Abstract: In recent years, image retrieval has received tremendous attentions  and some progresses have been made.  However, most existing work on  image retrieval focuses on specific issues and techniques local to  image computing or access.  Little work has been done to combine  various aspects into a single framework.  In this paper, we describe  our approach of developing a general-purpose image retrieval system  over the web.  A main feature of our system is its hybrid approach by integrating both semantic and visual feature retrieval methods.  By  combining keyword-based query selection with content-based retrieval techniques, the system is able to provide effective image searching  and retrieval.  The results are further improved through a relevance  feedback process.  A research prototype system has been constructed  on a web environment, and experimental results demonstrate the  effectiveness of the new approach.  25 Refs.

Title: On service prioritization in Mobile Ad-hoc networks
Abstract: The aim of service prioritization is to give resource priority to  certain traffic types.  For example, voice service can have higher  priority than data service, web surfing can have higher priority  than FTP and email applications, or some users can have higher  priority than others.  This paper investigates the performance of  service prioritization in Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs).  Two  schemes, priority buffer management and priority scheduling, are  applied to realize service prioritization and three service profiles are discussed as well as.  Simulation results are presented to show  that the priority schemes work well with TCP traffic but not with  Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic.  Besides this, the priority  scheduling scheme outperforms the priority buffer management scheme  in terms of average end-to-end delay of TCP packets and average  throughput of TCP sessions.  7 Refs.

Title: A cost-based admission control algorithm for handling mixed workloads in multimedia server systems
Abstract: We propose and analyze a cost-based, resource-reservation admission  control algorithm for handling mixed workloads in modern multimedia  systems such as a digital library multimedia system that must  provide access services to heterogeneous objects stored in the  library.  The cost-based scheme considered in the paper is based on  the concept of "rewards" and "penalties" associated with requests of various object types.  Instead of admitting object requests until  resources are exhausted as a condition for admission control,  resources are reserved to requests of different types dynamically  based on the cost-based scheme so that the system is capable of  maximizing the total reward received by the system in response to  workload changes in the environment.  9 Refs.

Title: Research and evaluation of near-replicas of web pages detection  algorithms
Abstract: Many documents are replicated across the World-wide Web.  How to  efficiently and accurately find the near-replicas of web pages  becomes an important topic in the search engine research area, which can be used to improve the quality of searching service.  We propose  five near-replicas detection algorithms for search engines that rely on keyword matching, and evaluate them using the WebGather search  engine system.  In addition, we also compare our method with one of  the most popular copy detection mechanisms.  Our method is  successfully adopted to remove the near-replicas of web pages in  WebGather, and it can also be widely used to build library.  3 Refs.

Title: EquiLoad: A load balancing policy for clustered web servers
Abstract: We present a new strategy for the allocation of requests in clustered web servers, based on the size distribution of the requested  documents.  This strategy, EquiLoad, manages to achieve a balanced  load to each of the back-end servers, and its parameters are  obtained from the analysis of a trace's past data.  To study its  performance, we use phase-type distribution fittings and solve the  resulting models using a new solution method for M/PH/1 queues that  only requires solution of linear systems.  The results show that  EquiLoad greatly outperforms random allocation, performs comparably  or better than the Shortest Remaining Processing Time and Join  Shortest Queue policies and maximizes cache hits at the back-end  servers, therefore behaving similarly to a "locality-aware"  allocation policy, but at a very low implementation cost. copy 2001  Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract: Handling XML documents through database management systems (DBMS) is  discussed.  XML documents are application relevant objects to be  stored and managed by a database management systems (DBMS).  They are document centric since their meaning depends on the document as a  whole.  The structure is more irregular and data are heterogenous.   XML documents prevails in personalized publishing, portals,  customized presentations and content and document applications.  XML  encoding software often supports data formatting services in DBMS  query language and encode the resulting data in an XML document to  be transferred over the network.  Representation of XML storage are  unstructured and hybrid representation in DBMS.  (Edited abstract) 4  Refs.

Title: A Web caching primer
Abstract: Web resource caching technology is used to make Web scalable and to  improve computer performance.  It can reduce network latencies,  bandwidth demands and Web server loads.  A web cache stores web  resources in anticipation of future requests, resulting from the  nonuniformity of web object sizes, retrieval costs, and  cacheability.  Caching is performed in various locations throughpout  the web including two end points known to a typical user- web  browser and web server.  Caching helps bridge the performance gap  between local activity and remote content.  Caching helps to improve  web performance by reducing the cost and the end user latency for  web access.

Abstract: With the growing number of internet users in today's world the  internet service is on expansion.  Scalability issues are on the rise as there is a huge gap between average and peak workloads.  Average  statistical loads across disparate communities is one way to solve  the problem.  Content distribution network (CDN) and other large  distributed services can gain economies of scale by serving multiple customers.  Services with high amount of personalized content require a large number of servers called Web server farm, use special  techniques to make these servers work terms of performance and  accuracy.  Caching and replication are two methods for improving  performance and the increasingly blurry division between them.   (Edited abstract) 2 Refs.

Title: Developing WWW-based highly interactive and collaborative  applications using software components
Abstract: This paper describes a layered framework to support WWW-based  interactive and collaborative applications.  Using some  commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software, three basic services are  built: virtual rooms, virtual file systems, and database  connectivity.  These services are used at a second layer, which  actually provides the functionality of the framework.  The components that have been described at this level can be embedded in WWW-based  business applications in an easy and direct way.  Therefore,  programmers can focus on the particular logic of their applications, avoiding most of the issues related to collaboration, networking,  and access control.  In order to test the developed framework a  WWW-based educational application has been implemented.  This  tele-education system, with innovative features in the field of  WWW-based practical training, is the second contribution presented  by the authors.

Title: Web security: Authentication-protocols and their analysis
Abstract: Authentication is one of the basic building blocks of computer  security.  It is achieved through the execution of an authentication  protocol between two or more parties.  One such protocol, the Secure  Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, has become the de facto standard for  Web security.  This paper provides an overview of results and methods used in analyzing authentication protocols.  The aim is to provide a  bird's eye view of the assumptions, methods, and results that are  available for anyone who is interested in designing new security  protocols or applying a new analysis approach.  A detailed  description of the SSL handshake protocol as well as how changes in  environment assumption can lead to unexpected consequences, is  provided.  A fix to the weakness is also described.  30 Refs.

Title: An evaluation model for Web-based instruction
Abstract: Recently Web-based instruction (WBI) has been adopted for many  educational systems in order to support distance education.  WBI  becomes popular in that it overcomes time and space limitation in  the traditional education system.  But due to lack of face-to-face  communication, it is crucial that WBI has to provide interactivity  and motivation for students.  This paper provides a formal model that evaluates interactivity and motivation for courses based on WBI.  The model is comprehensive and objective so that it can be used to  evaluate any courses.  Based on the model, the paper selects some WBI courses and compares them for their interactivity and motivation  provided.  Finally, the paper concludes the work and discusses  further research issues.

Title: An update on the SimulNet educational platform: Toward  standards-driven e-learning
Abstract: E-learning is one of the killer applications in the new Information  Society.  In recent years, many educational systems have been  developed, targeted to specific learning environments.  One specific  area of concern is practical training.  This paper presents the  latest update on the WWW-based teaching laboratory SimulNet.   Particularly, we describe the functionality of the SimulNet  whiteboard and authoring tools.  Among others, the whiteboard  features allow any kind of data sharing on the Web, on-line  synchronous communication among learners and instructors and the  possibility of following virtual presentations with an embedded  Web-based slide projector.  The SimulNet authoring environment  includes a multimedia editor tool and both static and dynamic  content structure generator.  Also, current efforts in the learning  technology standardization process were taken into account.  We set  the basis to make SimulNet compliant with the leading standard  recommendations.

Title: TANGOW: A model for internet-based learning
Abstract: Learning is one of the most interesting applications of  internet-based systems.  At present, several approaches are being  carried out in order to make this process adaptive.  In this context, 'adaptivity' mainly refers to adapting the instructional material to different students under certain conditions: i) the instructional  material is available as a whole and ii) potential students can be  essentially different.  Moreover, it is not possible to talk about  'adaptivity' whenever a complete set of courses about the same  subject is available; each is designed for a specific student  profile.  In this framework, the TANGOW system aims to provide a  model in which most of the desirable features of internet-based  learning processes are taken into account.  TANGOW stands for  Task-based Adaptive learNer Guidance On the WWW.  20 Refs.

Recent work has demonstrated that cooperative  congestion control strategies between flows can improve performance  for a variety of applications, ranging from aggregated TCP  transmissions to multiple-sender multicast applications.  However, in order for this cooperation to be effective, one must first identify  the flows that are congested at the same set of resources.  In this  paper, we present techniques based on loss or delay observations at  end-hosts to infer whether or not two flows experiencing congestion  are congested at the same network resources.  We validate these  techniques via queueing analysis, simulation, and experimentation  within the Internet.  18 Refs.

Title: Usage measurement for statistical web testing and reliability  analysis
Abstract: In this paper, we gather web usage and related failure information by analyzing various web logs commonly kept for system administration  purposes.  The usage information can be used to build models for  statistical web testing.  The related failure information can be used to measure the reliability of web applications.  In addition, these  data can be used to measure the potential effectiveness of  statistical web testing.  We applied this approach to analyze the web logs of the School of Engineering and Applied Science at Southern  Methodist University.  The results demonstrated the viability and  effectiveness of our approach.  10 Refs.

Title: A computational model and classification framework for social  navigation
Abstract: Social navigation is the process of making navigational decisions in  real or virtual environments based on social and communicative  interaction with others.  A computational model for social navigation is presented as an extension to an existing framework for general  navigation, reducing decision-making to the minimization of  cognitive costs.  Consideration for social navigation gives rise to a classification framework based on the synchronicity, directness, and social presence during social interaction, each of which has direct  effect on the cognitive costs of navigational tasks.  Finally, a new  recommender system, TRAILGUIDE, is presented as a tool that  facilitates social navigation by allowing authors to explicitly  publish "trails" within and between World Wide Web pages.  23 Refs.

Title: Towards context-based search engine selection
Abstract: A well-known problem for web search is targeting search on  information that satisfies users' information needs.  User queries  tend to be short, and hence often ambiguous, which can lead to  inappropriate results from general-purpose search engines.  This has  led to a number of methods for narrowing queries by adding  information.  This paper presents an alternative approach that aims  to improve query results by using knowledge of a user's current  activities to select search engines relevant to their information  needs, exploiting the proliferation of high-quality special-purpose  search services.  The paper introduces the PRISM source selection  system and describes its approach.  It then describes two initial  experiments testing the system's methods.  13 Refs.

Title: What do users prefer? A personalized intelligent user interface for  searching information - An empirical study
Abstract: Searching the web for information becomes a tedious task.  As a result of any query, the user gets large numbers of responses, most of them irrelevant.  Existing search tools fail to cope with this information overload, mainly due to lack of personalization.  Current  developments emphasize better representation of user interests and  dynamic adaptation based on relevance feedback, but personalization  is much more then just that.  The present study examines the impact  of search tools adaptation to their users.  A significant preference  toward user-oriented search method over the conventional  content-based method was found.  The results clearly demonstrate the  need for self-adapting personalized interfaces as mediators between  users and information repositories of all kinds.  16 Refs.

Title: Fisheye menus
Abstract: We introduce "fisheye menus" which apply traditional fisheye  graphical visualization techniques to linear menus.  This provides  for an efficient mechanism to select items from long menus, which  are becoming more common as menus are used to select data items in,  for example, e-commerce applications.  Fisheye menus dynamically  change the size of menu items to provide a focus area around the  mouse pointer.  This makes it possible to present the entire menu on  a single screen without requiring buttons, scrollbars, or  hierarchies.  A pilot study with 10 users compared user preference of fisheye menus with traditional pull-down menus that use scrolling  arrows, scrollbars, and hierarchies.  Users preferred the fisheye  menus for browsing tasks, and hierarchical menus for goal-directed  task.  25 Refs.

Title: Dynamic channel assignment with delay and loss considerations for  wireless TDMA LANs
Abstract: The scarce available bandwidth and the unpredictable, variable bit  rate traffic in modern packet-switched wireless LANs, require an  efficient channel allocation scheme.  In this paper we make an  overview of traditional call-by-call Dynamic Channel Assignment  (DCA) methods and propose a novel DCA method that aims at assigning  channels in a more dynamic way, based on the quality-of-service  (QoS) required by different connections.  Although the method can be  applied in different wireless environments, here it is used in a  wireless ATM LAN, in conjunction with a TDMA/TDD medium access  control protocol.  Simulation results at the end of the paper show  that this kind of methods can improve significantly the performance  of the system.  16 Refs.

Title: Considerations on link and system throughput of Bluetooth networks
Abstract: The radio network performance of a large number of Bluetooth piconets is investigated in this contribution.  Asynchronous packet data  connections are considered exclusively.  Continuously transmitting  piconets as well as partially loaded piconets with constant average  user bit rate (according to a WWW traffic model) are treated.  All  piconets are located in a single room.  It turns out that Bluetooth  provides a large capacity for data connections.  Under normal load  conditions, the link throughput is degraded only marginally by  interference.  Several hundred simultaneous WWW sessions are feasible in the considered scenario.  A maximum aggregate system throughput of about 18 Mbit/s can be obtained.  In general, long and uncoded  Bluetooth packet types should be preferred for data transmission,  since they provide for the largest throughput in most interference  conditions.  4 Refs.

Title: Prototype implementation of a WWW based analog circuit design tool
Abstract: A new CAD tool used for the interactive exploration of a design space has been developed.  The interactive nature of the tool facilitates  the acquisition of designer knowledge which may accelerate the  development of improved circuit topologies in the future.  The tool's cross-platform compatibility and network centric architecture  prevents reinvention and facilitates organization-wide or worldwide  communication via design knowledge repositories.  To demonstrate its  utility in the area of analog circuit design, the tool was used to  model the design tradeoffs available during the design of a  telescopic cascode amplifier.  There was good agreement between the  response predicted by the new tool and a full SPICE simulation.  9  Refs.

Title: A graph-based approach for extracting terminological properties of  elements of XML documents
Abstract: XML is rapidly becoming a standard for information exchange over the  Web.  Web providers and applications using XML for representing and  exchanging their data make their information available in such a way that interoperability can be easily reached.  However, in order to  guarantee both the exchange of XML documents and the  interoperability between information providers, it is often needed  to single out semantic similarity properties relating concepts of  different XML documents.  This paper gives a contribution in this  framework by proposing a technique for extracting synonymies and  homonymies.  The derivation technique is based on a rich conceptual  model (called SDR-Network) which is used to represent concepts  expressed in XML documents as well as the semantic relationships  homing among them.  15 Refs.

Title: Implementation of a WebDAV-based collaborative distance learning  environment
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach for constructing  Collaborative Distance Learning (CDL) environment utilizing the  latest IETF specification: WebDAV.  As a Web-based groupware in  nature, this CDL environment enables distance learners to accomplish most of academic collaboration activities that are needed in a  virtual university directly on the Web through standard Web  browsers.  Besides WebDAV, an enterprise-level platform: J2EE is  adopted as the foundation of the CDL environment in this approach.   It ensures the scalability, extensibility, and openness of the  system facilitated by sets of J2EE technologies, e.g., EJB,  JavaBeans, and JSP, etc. We then introduce a prototype  implementation of the CDL environment called "Collaborative Desk".   "Collaborative Desk" will be applied as an important way for  supporting collaborative learning in a virtual university.  28 Refs.

Title: Effects of thermal noise on accuracy of measured BLAST capacities
Abstract: There are ever increasing demands in wireless communications for  additional capacity to handle voice data and wideband Internet  applications.  These demands are constrained by the bandwidth that  was allocated to wireless communications and practical limits on  maximum power and minimum cell size.  The spectral efficiencies in  present day wireless systems hover around 1 bit/s/Hz.  BLAST  (Bell-labs LAyered Space-Time) is a communication technique for  achieving very high spectral efficiencies in highly scattering  environments using multiple transmit and receive antennas.  A  measurement campaign was undertaken to assess the BLAST gains in  spectral efficiency in various environments.  The measurements were  to be performed over a narrow band at 2.44GHz with five transmitting and seven receiving antennas, respectively.  The effects of thermal  noise on the accuracy of measured BLAST capacities are investigated.  6 Refs.

Title: Scheduling in a meta search engine by genetic algorithm
Abstract: The meta search engines provide service to the users by dispensing  the users' requests to the existing search engines.  The existing  search engines selected by meta search engine determine the  searching quality.  Because the performance of the existing search  engines and the users' requests are changed dynamically, it is not  favorable for the fixed search engines to optimize the holistic  performance of the meta search engine.  This paper applies the  genetic algorithm (GA) to realize the scheduling strategy of agent  manager in our meta search engine, GSE (general search engine),  which can simulate the evolution process of living things more  lively and more efficiently.  By using GA, the combination of search  engines can be optimized and hence the holistic performance of GSE  can be improved dramatically.  16 Refs.

Title: PiNet: Wireless connectivity for organizational information access  using lightweight handheld devices
Abstract: In order to support connectivity requirements for today's pervasive  devices, a new type of wireless network is needed.  Pervasive  Information Network (PiNet) is a new wireless connectivity  architecture designed to support access to organizational  information using lightweight handheld devices.  PiNet's main  objective is to support a mass-market-type application, where  thousands of users can simultaneously have interactive access to a  variety of organizational information sources while maintaining a  short response time and using a simple, low-cost, power-limited  pervasive device.  This article summarizes the necessary  characteristics of PiNet and presents a survey of the existing main  technologies, explaining how they fall short of providing a total  solution for pervasive wireless networks.  In conclusion, this  document indicates the direction that must be taken in order to  design a solution that will provide a large number of users with a  practical means of obtaining information in a timely manner.  7 Refs.

Abstract: The Guidance System Evaluation Laboratory (GSEL) at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) has developed a  Hardware-in-the-Loop (HWIL) Kinetic Warhead (KW) test capability to  support the STANDARD Missile-3 (SM-3) program.  The capability is  designed to assess KW functionality in the laboratory using complex  IR scene stimulus for pre-flight testing and modeling validation.   Key components are a 6-DOF body dynamics simulation computer, a  Matra BAe IR scene rendering computer, and a BAe Systems resistive  heater IR display.  This paper examines some of the unique issues  encountered in testing a strapdown IR seeker interceptor using a  resistive heater display and their resulting impact on the design of 6-DOF simulation software and supporting test computer architecture.  We discuss architecture and software implementation issues along  with the complimentary use of high-fidelity all-digital and HWIL  simulations to provide a broad test capability.  3 Refs.

Abstract: A unified perceptual reasoning system framework for adaptive sensor  fusion and situation assessment is presented.  The concept and  application of perception, the resultant system architecture and its candidate renditions using knowledge-based systems and associative  memory are discussed.  The perceptual reasoning system is shown to be a natural governing mechanism for extracting, associating and fusing information from multiple sources while adaptively controlling the  Joint Director of Laboratories (JDL) Fusion Model processes for  optimum fusion system performance.  The unified modular system  construct is shown to provide a formal framework to accommodate  various implementation alternatives.  The application of this  architectural concept is illustrated for representative network  centric surveillance system architecture.  A target identification  system using Dempster-Shafer declarations level fusion is used to  demonstrate the benefits of the adaptive perceptual reasoning system and the iterative evidential reasoning method.  36 Refs.

Title: A multimedia terminal architecture for dynamically configurable  protocol stacks
Abstract: This paper presents a generic architecture for multimedia terminals  with respect to the management and implementation of dynamic and  programmable protocol stacks.  This architecture is built around the  combination of CORBA based management components and real-time  multimedia data processing engines.  The management objects export a  set of easily usable interfaces, which allow cascading and  configuring the engines in such a way that they terminate multimedia network connections with the desired protocol stack.  Terminal  software components, which are designed according to existing  multimedia delivery standards (such as TINA or H.323) can be easily  integrated with these CORBA components in order to introduce dynamic programmable multimedia endpoints in the terminal(s).  7 Refs.

Title: MMX-like architecture extension to support the rotation operation
Abstract: Some of the most important and extended algorithms used for  multimedia applications can be formulated in terms of rotations.  In  this paper we present guidelines to modify the current architecture  of MMX-like processors to support rotation efficiently.  To perform  the rotations we have selected the CORDIC algorithm for two reasons: first, it has proved to be one of the best for this operation, and  second, the architecture of the CORDIC algorithm is sufficiently  simple to be adapted to current processors with no serious  modifications to the original processor structure.  Therefore, we  consider it feasible to include this kind of operation in future  versions of the multimedia extension of general purpose processors.   13 Refs.

Title: Efficient hardware-software co-design for the G.723.1 algorithm  targeted at VoIP applications
Abstract: With the growing demand for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)  services, it has become increasingly important to design ASICs  implementing the H.323 algorithm efficiently, with capabilities of  handling multiple channels, so as to allow cost-effective  implementation of H.323 GSTN and ISDN Gateways.  In this paper, the  G.723.1 speech codec, which is an integral part of the H.323  specification, is investigated and an efficient hardware-software  co-design is proposed.  This design reduces the MIPS requirement for  the G.723.1 implemented on the 16-bit OAK DSP core by 17%for the 5.3 kbits/s encoder and by 11% for the 6.3 kbits/s encoder.  This is  achieved by identifying the inherent parallelism in the G.723.1  algorithm and implementing a sizeable portion of the algorithm in  hardware, while the DSP is concurrently executing part of the  algorithm.  The overhead of transferring data between the firmware  and hardware is reduced by using efficient memory access structures.  11 Refs.

Title: Hardware/software co-design of an elliptic curve public-key  cryptosystem
Abstract: This contribution discusses an implementation of an elliptic curve  public-key cryptosystem on the Atmel FPSLIC, a system on a chip  (SOC) that integrates a 40K FPGA with an AVR micro-controller and a  set of peripherals.  The FPGA is ideally suited for an efficient  implementation of the underlying finite field arithmetic.  The  software benefits the global control.  We use a standard basis  representation for the field elements and projective coordinates to  implement the group operation.  The results for area are comparable  with existing hardware implementations.  Although no attempts have  been made yet to reduce the critical path delay of the hardware  part, we obtained promising results towards speed and throughput.  A  clock frequency of 10 MHz is realized, but a lot more must be  possible after optimization.  17 Refs.

Title: Wireless industrial networking using CAN MAC-sublayer
Abstract: Controller Area Networks (CANs) can be used in the framework of real  time distributed industrial applications.  Regardless of the  application, it is very important to reduce the worst-case queueing  delay and the longest time taken to transmit a message in the MAC  (scheduling) and physical (choice of efficient modulation schemes)  sublayers.  In this paper, an extension of the basic Orthogonal  Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) principle known as On-Off  Keying modulation (OOK/OFDM-Multi-Carrier) switching principle is  given.  The influence of the presence of MultiPath Fading (MPF) on  the propagation segment and consequently on the real debits of CAN  networks for Wireless indoor communications is shown.  Furthermore,  some implementation details of emission and reception chains of a  modem-radio based on OOK and OFDM modulation schemes chosen for  Wireless communications are presented.

Title: Hart to enterprise connectivity
Abstract: The HART protocol was established as an open, de-facto industry  standard in 1990.  More than 10 million installed devices are in  operation worldwide benefiting from HART communication.  A  traditional view shared by many in the user community is that data  from the intelligent HART-capable field instruments is only  obtainable via a standard hand held terminal.  The reality is far  from the perception.  This paper describes how a personal computer  based server productivity tool can use HART communication to connect one or more intelligent instruments to the rest of the enterprise.   The server, which is based on the OPC standard, enables application  software packages such as SCADA/HMI software, Internet web browser,  Excel spreadsheet, SQC/SPC, MES, DCS, and Enterprise Resource  Planning software to receive real-time information from HART-capable instrumentation.  The open system standard based approach results in  lower integration costs and improved productivity for a very small  investment.  3 Refs.

Title: A local wavelet transform implementation versus an optimal row-column algorithm for the 2D multilevel decomposition
Abstract: A new method for the implementation of the binary-tree decomposition  of the convolution-based wavelet transform, called the Local Wavelet Transform (LWT) has been recently proposed in the literature.  While  it produces exactly the same results as the classical row-column  implementation of the transform, it has many implementation  benefits.  In this paper, this fact is shown experimentally for the  first time for a general-purpose processor-based architecture, by  comparing our C implementation of the LWT with an optimal C  implementation of the lifting-scheme row-column algorithm.  The  comparisons are made for the forward multilevel binary-tree  decomposition using the 9/7 filter pair, in the typical Intel  Pentium processor family.  15 Refs.

Title: Memory hierarchy exploration for low power architectures in embedded  multimedia applications
Abstract: Multimedia applications are characterized by an increased number of  data transfer and storage operations due to real time requirements.   Appropriate transformations can be applied at the algorithmic level  to improve crucial implementation characteristics.  In this paper,  the effect of the data-reuse transformations on power consumption,  area and performance of multimedia applications realized on embedded cores is examined.  As demonstrators, widely applicable video  processing algorithmic kernels, namely the row-column decomposition  DCT and its fast implementation found in MPEG-X, are used.   Experimental results prove that significant improvements in power  consumption can be achieved without performance degradation by the  application of data-reuse transformations in combination with the  use of a custom memory hierarchy.  8 Refs.

Title: Real time skin-region detection with a single-chip digital camera
Abstract: This article describes a 30 frames/second VGA format image sensor  made in a standard CMOS process with an embedded massively parallel  processor.  The processor is fully programmable and therefore the  sensor IC itself is able to run a variety of algorithms with data  and processing in close vicinity of the sensor.  Because of the  parallel architecture comprising processor array and parallel memory accesses, high computational performances of up to 5 GOPS at 16 Mhz  are achieved.  This high performance allowed us to implement skin  tone detection on the camera itself as part of a larger system for  face recognition, releasing the host computer of cumbersome pixel  processing tasks and minimizing the data transfer between camera and computer.  8 Refs.

Title: Internet and personality
Abstract: The Internet is becoming increasingly influential in our daily lives.  The author suggests that the personality of the net user is, for the most part, ignored by Internet designers who decide the future  development of the Internet.  The main reason for this is the heavy  emphasis placed by designers on technological advancement to the  detriment of user needs.  The author argues that the only way to  redress this balance is through a cooperative effort by Internet  designers and psychologists working in the field of personality.  The article examines the potential contribution of each of these  professions toward promoting a genuinely interactive Internet, fully committed to being user-friendly and promoting user well-being. copy 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: A user-programmable vertex engine
Abstract: In this paper we describe the design, programming interface, and  implementation of a very efficient user-programmable vertex engine.   The vertex engine of NVIDIA's GeForce3 GPU evolved from a highly  tuned fixed-function pipeline requiring considerable knowledge to  program.  Programs operate only on a stream of independent vertices  traversing the pipe.  Embedded in the broader fixed function  pipeline, our approach preserves parallelism sacrificed by previous  approaches.  The programmer is presented with a straightforward  programming model, which is supported by transparent multi-threading and bypassing to preserve parallelism and performance.  In the  remainder of the paper we discuss the motivation behind our design  and contrast it with previous work.  We present the programming  model, the instruction set selection process, and details of the  hardware implementation.  Finally, we discuss important API design  issues encountered when creating an interface to such a device.  We  close with thoughts about the future of programmable graphics  devices.  28 Refs.

Title: Embedded OSs gain the inside track
Abstract: Embeded operating systems are found in all kinds of devices and  systems, from high-end routers and switches that keep networks  running to medical devices, copiers and factory automation systems.   Open source embeded operating systems (OSs) were released based on  on BSD Unix and Linux.  They are less expensive and users can access  to and customize the source code.  Microsoft built windows CE  embedded with real time features such as nested interrupt support,  but didn't included such elements in Windows NT embedded which works only with x86 processors.  Virtual memory approach eliminates the  time consuming need in the flat memory model for programmers to  assign each task a specific memory address and to keep track of  these allocations.

Title: Compiling to a VLIW fragment pipeline
Abstract: The latest generation of graphics hardware supports fully  programmable vertex and pixel/fragment operations, but programming  this hardware at a low level is difficult and time consuming.  To  address this problem, we have developed a complete real-time  procedural shading system that compiles a high-level shading  language to programmable vertex and fragment hardware, as described  in a separate publication.  In this paper, we describe in detail the  algorithms used by this system to generate and optimize fragment  code for NVIDIA's register combiner architecture and show that our  compiler generates efficient code.  The register combiner  architecture has some similarities to VLIW CPU architectures, so we  compare our compilation algorithms to those described in the  literature for VLIW CPU architectures.  We also discuss some of the  lessons we learned from building and using this compiler that may be useful to the designers of future programmable graphics hardware.  17 Refs.

Title: Directed Point: A communication subsystem for commodity  supercomputing with Gigabit Ethernet
Abstract: In this paper, we study the practical issues on the design of a new  communication subsystem, named Directed Point (DP), on a server  cluster with Gigabit Ethernet connection, with the goals of  achieving high performance and good programmability.  Our design  exploits the gigabit network architecture and the operating system  characteristics.  We propose a realistic communication model which  can be used to assess various design tradeoffs and to calibrate the  performance results.  Testing shows that DP communication subsystem  can achieve a 16.3 mus single-trip latency and 79.5MBps bandwidth.   To achieve good programmability, we propose an abstraction model  that allows all inter-process communication patterns to be easily  coded using the provided API.  The API preserves the syntax and  semantics of traditional UNIX I/O operations, making the proposed  communication subsystem easy to use without long learning period.   copy 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: A cellular neural network modeling the behavior of reconfigurable  cellular automata
Abstract: The design and implementation of a cellular neural network (CNN)  architecture capable of modeling the behavior of reconfigurable  cellular automata (CA) is presented in this paper.  Despite the  simplicity of their structure CA are capable of exhibiting extremely complex behaviors.  This motivates the development of a  reconfigurable CA architecture, capable of exhibiting all types of  complex behaviors found in the different CA classes.  However, the  hardware complexity for developing such an architecture is very high and comes in direct contrast with the inherent modularity,  regularity, locality and homogeneity properties of CA architectures.  The CNN architecture presented in this paper is capable of learning  all the qualitative different CA behaviors, and it matches all the  inherent advantages of CA architectures.  Additionally, any hardware  reconfiguration costs are totally avoided. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  19 Refs.

Title: ASA: The active service architecture for new internet
Abstract: Because support of new distributed multimedia applications are an  important challenge for the Internet Service Providers, a lot of  works are under progress for enhancing the Internet architecture.   Thus, internet service architectures based upon new protocols have  been proposed.  While a new generation of internet ma be developed  from these proposals, the problem of the deployment of these new  technologies becomes of a prime importance.  In this article we  attempt to provide a solution to the internet evolution process by  means of a new concept, the active service architecture, that is  based on the new technology of active networking.  The concept of  activity in ASA architecture is presented, specification of the  nodes are given and an experimentation of active service is shown.   10 Refs.

Title: Design of 2K/4K/8K-point FFT processor based on cordic algorithm in  OFDM receiver
Abstract: In this paper, the architecture and the implementation of a  2K/4K/8K-point complex fast Fourier transform (FFT) processor for  OFDM system are presented.  The processor can perform 8K-point FFT  every 273mus, and 2K-point every 68.26mus at 30MHz which is enough  for OFDM symbol rate.  The architecture is based on the Cooley-Tukey  algorithm for decomposing the long DFT into short length  multi-dimensional DFTs.  The transposition and shuffle memories are  used for the implementation of multi-dimensional transforms.  The  CORDIC processor is employed for the twiddle factor multiplications  in each dimension.  A new twiddle factor generation method is also  proposed for saving the size of ROM required for storing the twiddle factors.  6 Refs.

Title: Scalability issues of dynamic space management for multiple-server  networked virtual environments
Abstract: This paper discusses the scalability issues of networked virtual  environments (net-VEs).  A most important problem of net-VEs is that  the performance of the system is remarkably deteriorated when users  increase in number.  To solve this problem, we proposed two methods.   The first method tries to equalize the load in each server by  dynamically adjusting the size of the space managed by each server.   The second method tries to reduce the amount of operations by  changing the size of a management unit of the virtual space.  To  evaluate the proposed methods, we developed a multiple-server  networked game called "CittaTron".  Through several experiments, we  show the effectiveness of our proposed method.  3 Refs.

Title: Design and implementation of an MVC-based architecture for E-commerce applications
Abstract: Although the separation of a model from its visual representation  (view) implies well-known benefits, available Java libraries do not  sufficiently support this concept.  This paper presents a  straight-forward way to smoothly enhance Java libraries in this  direction independently of the particular graphic user interface  (GUI) library.  The lean framework JGadgets, which was inspired by  the Oberon Gadgets system, allows developers to focus on model  programming only.  This significantly reduces development costs, in  particular in the realm of quite simple, form-based GUIs, which are  common-place in commercial e-business systems.  The authors first  present a case study implemented on top of JGadgets that  demonstrates the benefits of the MVC architecture.  They then go on  to sketch the reflection-based design of JGadgets itself.  12 Refs.

Title: On the creation of a generalized design optimization environment for  electromagnetic devices
Abstract: When optimizing designs for practical electromagnetic problems, the  number of design constraints and variables is increased drastically.  The construction and step-by-step creation of an electrical system,  in practice, is a trial and error process.  The design may lead to a  sub-optimal solution since the success of a design depends on the  experience of the designer.  Optimization requires that all design  goals, of a device, be connected into a single objective function  with all independent variables and constraints.  In practice,  effective pre-processing and post processing of data are necessary  in addition to the requirements of high performance computing  capabilities.  To achieve this process, we propose the utilization of the generalized design optimization environment or the virtual  designer described in this paper.  7 Refs.

Title: Input-queued router architectures exploiting cell-based switching  fabrics
Abstract: Input queued and combined input/output-queued architectures have  recently come to play a major role in the design of high-performance switches and routers for packet networks.  These architectures must  be controlled by a packet scheduling algorithm, which solves  contentions in the transfer of data units to switch outputs.  Several scheduling algorithms were proposed in the literature for switches  operating on fixed-size data units.  In this paper we consider the  case of packet switches, i.e., devices operating on variable-size  data units at their interfaces, but internally operating on  fixed-size data units, and we propose novel extensions of known  scheduling algorithms for input queued and combined  input/output-queued architectures.  We show by simulation that, in  the case of packet switches, input queued and combined  input/output-queued architectures can provide performance advantages over output-queued architectures. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: A simple and efficient parallel FFT algorithm using the BSP model
Abstract: We present a new parallel radix-4 FFT algorithm based on the BSP  model.  Our parallel algorithm uses the group-cyclic distribution  family, which makes it simple to understand and easy to implement.   We show how to reduce the communication cost of the algorithm by a  factor of 3, in the case that the input/output vector is in the  cyclic distribution.  We also show how to reduce computation time on  computers with a cache-based architecture.  We present performance  results on a Cray T3E with up to 64 processors, obtaining reasonable efficiency levels for local problem sizes as small as 256 and very  good efficiency levels for local sizes larger than 2048. copy 2001  Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Site-based approach to web cache design
Abstract: A site-based approach to Web caching tracks documents by sites rather than individual document names was analyzed.  The site-based  dispatching (SBD) technique solves the problem of frequent  overloading of the Internet proxy servers due to high volume of Web  traffic by reducing the unnecessary requests reaching the proxy  servers.  The least recently used (LRU) site-based approach was used  to design the cache replacement policies in which the system links  site names to form a site list.  In case of multicache design, it is  feasible to use site-based request forwarding, and the site-based  approach due to uneven Web server access rates simplifies the design complexity of dynamic caching hierarchies without drain on  performance.

Title: A base62 transformation format of ISO 10646 for multilingual  identifiers
Abstract: ISO 10646 Universal Character Set (UCS) is a 31-bit coding  architecture that covers symbols in most of the world's written  languages.  Identifiers in programming languages are usually defined  by using alphanumeric characters of ASCII, which represent mainly  English words.  An approach for working around this deficiency is to  encode multilingual identifiers into the alphanumeric range of  ASCII.  For case-sensitive languages, an encoding that utilizes left  bracket 0-9] [A-Z] left  bracket a-z] can be more space-efficient for  multilingual identifiers.  This paper proposes a base62  transformation format of ISO 10646 called UTF-62.  The resulting  string of UTF-62 is within a [0-9] left  bracket A-Z] [a-z] range, a  total of 62 base characters.  UTF-62 also preserves the lexicographic sorting order of UCS-4.  Copyright copy 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.   16 Refs.

Title: Reuse of addressable system bus for SOC testing
Abstract: This paper describes a novel test methodology for core-based SOCs.   The methodology is based on the use of the existing system bus  and/or peripheral bus to access the ports on embedded cores.  The  microprocessor situated in an SOC can access the addressable  terminals of embedded cores to feed test stimuli and to read  captured test responses.  This novel approach does not need  additional bus structures from chip I/Os to cores for the test  access mechanism; hence it significantly reduces area overhead, and  enables the use of the microprocessor's computing power to control  the test process of the deeply embedded cores on an SOC.  12 Refs.

Title: A stochastic global net-length distribution for a three-dimensional  system-on-a-chip (3D-SoC)
Abstract: A global net-length distribution for three-dimensional  system-on-a-chip architectures is derived to quantify the impact of  the number of strata, or active layers, on the length of the long  global interconnects.  Model projections indicate a reduction in the  global net length as the square root of the number of strata, thus  enabling a significant reduction in chip footprint area, power  dissipation, and global cycle time in comparison to a  two-dimensional system-on-a-chip.  Unlike its homogeneous  counterpart, the vertical integration of a heterogeneous system is  not limited by the density of interstratal interconnects.  The size  of the large megacells, especially memory, may restrict the  effectiveness of a large number of strata.  18 Refs.

Title: A novel all digital phase locked loop (ADPLL) with ultra fast locked  time and high oscillation frequency
Abstract: In this paper a new architecture for all digital phase locked loop  (ADPLL) is proposed.  The new architecture is based on the ADPLL  architecture proposed by Motorola in 1995 but modified in some  block.  A new binary search decision scheme was used to accelerate  the frequency acquisition process.  It can reduce the chip area and  increase the operating frequency.  In this design, a 14-bit control  word is used to control the digital control oscillator.  The new type ADPLL is designed and implement by TSMC's 0-35um IP4M CMOS process  for 3.3V applications.  The phase lock process takes 20-reference  cycle, and the maximum frequency of the proposed ADPLL is about  820MHz.  4 Refs.

Title: Algorithm, architecture, and implementation of algorithmic  delay-locked loop based data recovery circuit for high-speed serial  data communication
Abstract: An algorithmic delay-locked loop (DLL) based high-speed serial data  recovery circuit (DRC) architecture is proposed.  This scheme is  based on a novel modulator-based phase synthesis and phase error  compensation principle, which offers advantages of inherently  instantaneous locking capability, high jitter tolerance, and  unconditional loop stability.  Its fully digital, highly regular,  modular, and scaleable VLSI implementations is very suitable for the SOC solution to various high-speed, low power applications.  The  architecture has been implemented in test chips fabricated using a  0.25um standard CMOS process technology.  It occupied the area around 300um multiplied by 150um, consumed less than 4mW power.  It  demonstrated higher than 800Mb/s data rate, and a better than  10**-**9 BER at 480Mb/s rate and the best measured BER of better  than 10**-**1**2 with a 2**-**1**5-1 pseudo-random data stream  across a USB cable.  9 Refs.

Abstract: This paper presents a scaleable and extendable architecture  consisting of the essential building blocks for multimedia  information services.  It provides building blocks for multimedia  transport, storage, retrieval, filtering, and presentation, together with their interdependencies.  After presenting the overall  architecture, we focus in more detail on the 3-level modeling and  querying of multimedia data.  Emphasis is placed on the support for a wide variety of modeling and querying techniques in the context of a coherent architecture.  The description of the architecture is  followed by a description of a possible implementation of the  architecture focussing on specific modeling and querying techniques.  Finally, the use of the architectural components in a number of  example multimedia information retrieval services is shown.  26 Refs.

Title: Modeling and simulation of steady state and transient behaviors for  emergent SoCs
Abstract: We introduce a formal basis for viewing computer systems as mixed  steady state and non-steady state (transient) behaviors to motivate  novel design strategies resulting from simultaneous consideration of function, scheduling and architecture.  We relate three design  styles: Hierarchical decomposition, static mapping and directed  platform that have traditionally been separate.  By considering them  together, we reason that once a steady state system is mapped to an  architecture, the unused processing and communication power may be  viewed as a platform for a transient system, ultimately resulting in more effective design approaches that ease the static mapping  problem while still allowing for effective utilization of resources.  Our simulation environment, frequency interleaving, mixes a formal  and experimental approach as illustrated in an example.  17 Refs.

Title: Combined instruction and loop parallelism in array synthesis for  FPGAs
Abstract: Compiling perfect, uniform dependence loops to FPGA based  co-processors normally yields processor (PE) arrays where a PE  executes one instance of the loop body per clock cycle.  We develop a transformation framework in which the derived PE can be  systematically and automatically pipelined through retiming.  We use  well known transformations-skewing and serialization, by which an  arbitrary number of registers may be placed at the PE outputs.  They  are then moved into the PE data-path using standard commercial  circuit retimers.  Our experiments (based on performance estimates  after place-and-route) have been very encouraging.  For a number of  examples we have seen dramatic performance improvements: speed  increases of an order of magnitude with relatively little (always  less than 100%) area overhead.  12 Refs.

Title: Data cache energy minimizations through programmable tag size  matching to the applications
Abstract: An application-specific customization methodology for minimizing the  energy dissipation in the data cache of embedded processors is  presented in this paper.  The data cache subsystem is one of the most power consuming microarchitectural parts of embedded processors.  We  target in this work particularly the data cache tag operations and  show how an exceedingly small number of tag bits, if any, are needed to compute the miss/hit behavior for the vast majority of load/store instructions executed within application loops.  The energy needed to perform the tag reads and comparisons can be thus dramatically  reduced.  We follow up this conceptual enhancement with a  presentation of an efficient, reprogrammable implementation that  utilizes application-specific information to apply the suggested  energy minimization approach.  The conducted experimental results  confirm the expected significant decrease of energy dissipation for  a set of important numerical kernels.  14 Refs.

Title: Using static scheduling techniques for the retargeting of high speed, compiled simulators for embedded processors from an abstract machine description
Abstract: Instruction set simulators are indispensable tools for both the  design of programmable architectures and software development.   However, due to a constantly increasing processor complexity and the frequent demand for cycle-accurate models, such simulators have  become defectively slow.  The principle of compiled simulation  addresses this shortcoming.  Compiled simulators make use of a priori knowledge to accelerate simulation, with the highest efficiency  achieved by employing static scheduling techniques.  In the past,  such statically scheduled simulators have only been implemented for  specific DSP architectures.  The approach presented here discusses  the application of static scheduling techniques to retargetable  simulation tools based on the processor description language LISA.   Principles and implementation issues are discussed in this paper,  and results are presented for two selected processor architectures.   15 Refs.

Title: Evaluating the performance of reactive control architectures for  manufacturing production control
Abstract: The requirement for adaptable and re-configurable control systems for manufacturing has highlighted the inadequacies of traditional  centralised control approaches, leading researchers to focus on  decentralised approaches.  The question of what is the most  appropriate control architecture for a given system has led  industrial and academic researchers to develop a spectrum of  decentralised control architectures ranging from hierarchical to  non-hierarchical structures.  While current research has confirmed  the potential of decentralised architectures, neither extreme of  this control architecture spectrum has proven to be the most  appropriate choice for a given manufacturing system.  Recent research into providing an objective comparison of alternative control  architectures has shown that some degree of hierarchy is important  for distributed manufacturing control architectures.  This paper is  concerned with our current investigations into why these partial  hierarchies appear to display superior performance. copy 2001  Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  16 Refs.

Title: A method for designing secure solutions
Abstract: The task of developing information technology (IT) solutions that  consistently and effectively apply security principles has many  challenges, including: the complexity of integrating the specified  security functions within the several underlying component  architectures found in computing systems, the difficulty in  developing a comprehensive set of baseline requirements for  security, and a lack of widely accepted security design methods.   With the formalization of security evaluation criteria into an  international standard known as Common Criteria, one of the barriers to a common approach for developing extensible IT security  architectures has been lowered; however, more work remains.  This  paper describes a systematic approach for defining, modeling, and  documenting security functions within a structured design process in order to facilitate greater trust in the operation of resulting IT  solutions.  18 Refs.

Title: Scheduling image processing tasks in a multilayer system
Abstract: Multilayer multiprocessor systems are generally employed in real-time applications such as robotics and computer vision.  This paper  introduces three heuristic algorithms for multiprocessor task  scheduling in such systems.  In our model, tasks with arbitrary  processing times and arbitrary processor requirements are  considered.  The scheduling aims at minimising completion time of  processes in a two-layer system.  We employed an effective lower  bound (LB) for the problem.  Then, we analysed the average  performance of the heuristic algorithms by computing the average  percentage deviation of each heuristic solution from the LB on a set of randomly generated problems.  We have also applied these  algorithms for scheduling computer vision tasks running on prototype multilayer architecture.  Our computational and empirical results  showed that the proposed heuristic algorithms perform well. copy  2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  16 Refs.

Title: Using fundamental electrical theory for varying time quantum  uni-processor scheduling
Abstract: Given the total number of instructions to be completed on a uni-processor system and the average cycle time per instruction we introduce a method of calculating time quantum allocation to  individual fine grain tasks. The main theory behind our method is  based on fundamental equations describing electrical phenomenon. We  show how electric circuit analysis can be used to describe the  fundamental scheduling problem, and provide a framework for defining more elaborate scheduling problems such as multiprocessor and  multicomputer task scheduling.  As a matter of physical soundness we  demonstrate through unit derivation that our electrical analogy  provides proper physical quantities that are supported by current literature.  Our analysis shows that variable time round-robin  scheduling (VTRR) provides a more appropriate means of scheduling  fine-grain tasks than constant time round-robin scheduling (CTRR). We prove that, our VTRR scheduler always completes at least one task per cycle.  We show through numerical comparisons some differences between VTRR and CTRR performance

Abstract: Automatic 3D acquisition devices (often called 3D scanners) allow to  build highly accurate models of real 3D objects in a cost- and  time-effective manner.  We have experimented this technology in a  particular application context: the acquisition of Cultural Heritage artefacts.  Specific needs of this domain are: medium-high accuracy,  easy of use, affordable cost of the scanning device, self-registered acquisition of shape and color data, and finally operational safety  for both the operator and the scanned artefacts.  According to these  requirements, we designed a low-cost 3D scanner based on structured  light which adopts a new, versatile colored stripe pattern approach.  We present the scanner architecture, the software technologies  adopted, and the first results of its use in a project regarding the 3D acquisition of an archaeological statue.  24 Refs.

Abstract: A work cell with multiple robots increases manufacturing flexibility  and productivity.  Robots in the work cell equipped in a sparse area  usually share a motion path, resources and workspace.  In this paper, an embedded Markov chain model for a multi-robot system that has a  common workspace is constructed on the basis of the concept of a  multi-processor system.  With the presented model, we measure the  performance of error recovery schemes under different workloads and  analyze the sensitivity of the execution time with respect to the  robot speed.  We verify the presented model with an experimental  multi-robot work cell.

Title: A modular, analytical throughput model for modern disk arrays
Abstract: Enterprise storage systems depend on disk arrays for their capacity  and availability needs.  To design and maintain storage systems that  efficiently satisfy evolving requirements, it is critical to be able to evaluate configuration alternatives without having to physically  implement them.  In this paper, we describe an analytical model to  predict disk array throughput, based on a hierarchical decomposition of the internal array architecture.  We validate the model against a  state-of-the-art disk array for a variety of synthetic workloads and array configurations.  To our knowledge, no previously published  analytical model has either incorporated the combined effects of the complex optimizations present in modern disk arrays, or been  validated against a real, commercial array.  Our results are quite  encouraging for an analytical model: predictions are accurate in  most cases within 32% of the observed array performance (15% on the  average) for our set of experiments.  25 Refs.

Title: Evolving system architecture to meet changing business goals: An  agent and goal-oriented approach
Abstract: Today's requirements engineering approaches focus on notation and  techniques for modeling the intended functionality and qualities of  a software system.  Little attention has been given to systematically understanding and modeling the relationships between business goals  and system qualities, and how these goals are met during  architectural design.  In particular, modeling must encompass changes to business goals over time and their effects upon a system's  architecture.  This poster reports on a case study, performed at a  telecommunication company, that illustrates the decision-making  process regarding architectural changes introduced into an existing  switching system product.  A notation including goals, strategic  agents and intentional dependency relationships is used to support  the architectural modeling and reasoning.  18 Refs.

Title: Requirements-based dynamic metrics in object-oriented systems
Abstract: Because early design decisions can have a major long-term impact on  the performance of a system, early evaluation of the high-level  architecture can be an important risk mitigation technique.  This  paper proposes a technique for predicting the volume of data that  will flow across a network in a distributed system.  The prediction  is based upon anticipated execution of scenarios and can be applied  at an extremely early stage of the design.  It is driven by  requirements specifications and captures dynamic metrics by defining typical usage patterns in terms of scenarios.  Scenarios are then  mapped to architectural components, and dataflow across  inter-partition links is estimated.  The feasibility of the approach  is demonstrated through an experiment in which predicted metrics are compared to runtime measurements.  14 Refs.

Title: Residual requirements and architectural residues
Abstract: Monitoring running systems is a useful technique available to  requirements engineers, to ensure that systems meet their  requirements and in some cases to ensure that they obey the  assumptions under which they were created.  This report studies  relationships between the original requirements and the monitoring  infrastructure.  Here we postulate that the monitored requirements  are in fact just compilations of original requirements, called  "residual" requirements.  Dynamic architectural models have become  important tools for expressing requirements on modern distributed  systems.  Monitoring residual requirements will be seen to involve  "architectural residues," skeletal run-time images of the original  logical architecture.  An example sales support system is used to  illustrate the issues involved, employing modest extensions to the  Acme architecture description language to reason about architectural dynamism.  22 Refs.

Title: Implementing traffic shaping and link scheduling on a  high-performance server
Abstract: This paper examines the implementation of traffic shaping and link  scheduling mechanisms on an end-host server.  We first compare  various implementation strategies, and then present a network  interface architecture with dedicated support for traffic shaping  and link scheduling for use in end-host servers.  This results in  significant load reduction on the server CPU, as shaping and  scheduling tasks can execute concurrently on the network interface.   This allows the server to provide very fine-grain link multiplexing, and consequently more diverse set of QoS guarantees for a large  number of flows.  We present two alternative implementations of our  architecture.  The first uses custom hardware while the second is  implemented as a software component running on a dedicated processor on the network interface.  35 Refs.

Title: A pipelined architecture for the multidimensional DFT
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient pipelined architecture for the  N**m-point m-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (DFT).  By using  a two-level index mapping scheme that is different from the  conventional decimation-in-time (DIT) or decimation-infrequency  (DIF) algorithms, the conventional pipelined architecture for the  one-dimensional (1-D) fast Fourier transform (FFT) can be  efficiently used for the computation of higher dimensional DFTs.   Compared with systolic architectures, the proposed scheme is  area-efficient since the Computational elements (CEs) use the  minimum number of multipliers, and the number of CEs increases only  linearly with respect to the dimension m. It can be easily extended  to the N**m-point m-dimensional DFT with large m and/or N, and it is more flexible since the throughput can be easily varied to  accommodate various area/throughput requirements.  16 Refs.

Title: A time-stamping algorithm for efficient performance estimation of  superscalar processors
Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern superscalar microprocessors makes the evaluation of new designs and techniques much more difficult.   Fast and accurate methods for simulating program execution on  realistic and hypothetical processor models are of great interest to many computer architects and compiler writers.  There are many  existing techniques, from profile based runtime estimation to  complete cycle-level simulations.  Many researchers choose to  sacrifice the speed of profiling for the accuracy obtainable by  cycle-level simulators.  This paper presents a technique that  provides accurate performance predictions, while avoiding the  complexity associated with a complete processor emulator.  The  approach augments a fast in-order simulator with a time-stamping  algorithm that provides a very good estimate of program running  time.  This algorithm achieves an average accuracy that is within  7.5% of a cycle-level out-of-order simulator in approximately 41% of the running time on the eight SPECInt95 integer benchma rks.  25  Refs.

Title: Facile: A language and compiler for high-performance processor  simulators
Abstract: Architectural simulators are essential tools for computer  architecture and systems research and development.  Simulators,  however, are becoming frustratingly slow, because they must now  model increasingly complex micro-architectures running realistic  workloads.  Previously, we developed a technique called  fast-forwarding, which applied partial evaluation and memoization to improve the performance of detailed architectural simulations by as  much as an order of magnitude.  While writing a detailed processor  simulator is difficult, implementing fast-forwarding is even more  complex.  This paper describes Facile, a domain-specific language for writing detailed, accurate micro-architecture simulators.   Architectural descriptions written in Facile can be compiled, using  partial evaluation techniques, into fast-forwarding simulators that  achieve significant performance improvements with far less  programmer effort.  Facile and its compiler make this  performance-enhancing technique accessible to computer architects.   14 Refs.

Title: Un marco para IP global de difusion ilimitada (GIA) escalable   A framework for scalable global IP-anycast (GIA)
Abstract: This paper proposes GIA, a scalable architecture for global  IP-anycast.  Existing designs for providing IP-anycast must either  globally distribute mutes to individual anycast groups, or confine  each anycast group to a pre-configured topological region.  The first approach does not scale because of excessive growth in the routing  tables, whereas the second one severely limits the utility of the  service.  Our design scales by dividing inter-domain anycast routing  into two components.  The first component builds inexpensive default  anycast routes that consume no bandwidth or storage space.  The  second component, controlled by the edge domains, generates enhanced anycast routes that are customized according to the beneficiary  domain's interests.  We evaluate the performance of our design using  simulation, and prove its practicality by implementing it in the  Multi-threaded Routing Toolkit.  28 Refs.

Title: Ordering disks for double erasure codes
Abstract: Disk arrays have been designed with two competing goals in mind, the  ability to reconstruct erased disks (reliability), and the speed  with which information can be read, written, and reconstructed  (performance).  The substantial loss in performance of write  operations as reliability requirements increase has resulted in an  emphasis on performance at the expense of reliability.  This has  proved acceptable given the relatively small numbers of disks in  current disk arrays.  We develop a method for improving the  performance of write operations in disk arrays capable of correcting any double erasure, by ordering the columns of the erasure code to  minimize the amount of parity information that requires updating.   For large disk arrays, this affords a method to support the  reliability needed without the generally accepted loss of  performance.  23 Refs.

Title: Demonstrating the scalability of a molecular dynamics application on  a petaflop computer
Abstract: The IBM Blue Gene project has endeavored into the development of a  cellular architecture computer with millions of concurrent threads  of execution.  One of the major challenges of this project is  demonstrating that applications can successfully exploit this  massive amount of parallelism.  Starting from the sequential version  of a well known molecular dynamics code, we developed a new  application that exploits the multiple levels of parallelism in the  Blue Gene cellular architecture.  We perform both analytical and  simulation studies of the behavior of this application when executed on a vow large number of threads.  As a result, we demonstrate that  this class of applications can execute efficiently on a large  cellular machine.  15 Refs.

Title: Optimizing threaded MPI execution on SMP clusters
Abstract: Our previous work has shown that using threads to execute MPI  programs can yield great performance gain on multiprogrammed  shared-memory machines.  This paper investigates the design and  implementation of a thread-based MPI system on SMP clusters.  Our  study indicates that with a proper design for threaded MPI  execution, both point-to-point and collective communication  performance can be improved substantially, compared to a  processbased MPI implementation in a cluster environment.  Our  contribution includes a hierarchy-aware and adaptive communication  scheme for threaded MPI execution and a thread-safe network device  abstraction that uses event-driven synchronization and provides  separated collective and point-to-point communication channels.  This paper describes the implementation of our design and illustrates its performance advantage on a Linux SMP cluster.  20 Refs.

Title: A synthesis of memory mechanisms for distributed architectures
Abstract: Producing efficient parallel programs for distributed memory  multiprocessors is a difficult task.  Hand-coding efficient parallel  programs for these systems can be extremely difficult, time  consuming and error-prone, so people have turned to the shared  memory abstraction and automatic parallelizing compilers to ease the task.  The two main approaches to this are using compilers that 1)  generate message passing code, or 2) generate code for a distributed shared memory software layer.  Neither has been completely successful for all types of programs.  In this paper, we discuss the use of a  combination of these mechanisms to produce a compiler code  generation paradigm that can be successful for many user programs.   The experimental results indicate that our new paradigm would be  able to support both regular and irregular code efficiently.  22  Refs.

Title: A systematic approach to software peripherals for embedded systems
Abstract: The continued growth of microprocessors' performance and the need for better CPU utilization, has led to the introduction of the software  peripherals' approach: By this term we refer to software modules  that can successfully emulate peripherals that, until now, were  traditionally implemented in hardware.  Software implementations  offer great flexibility in product design and in functional  upgrades, while they have high contribution in the cost/performance  ratio optimization.  We focus on embedded applications, where the  cost and the short time to market are the leading issues.  In this  paper, we study the hardware and software requirements for  developing a generic microprocessor with support for software  peripherals.  Additionally, we present three software peripherals, a  Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter, a keypad controller and a dot matrix LCD controller, and we analyze their impact in CPU  occupation.  Finally, we explore the impact of using a software UART  on system power dissipation.  19 Refs.

Title: Exploring design space of parallel realizations: MPEG-2 decoder case  study
Abstract: Many applications lend them to parallelism at different levels of  granularity.  We first identify the key issues involved in creating a parallel model of an application.  These are done with a view to  estimate performance and explore the "parallel" design space to  select a suitable design point.  The framework presented provides an  opportunity to perform this exploration both in the target  architecture independent and target architecture dependent manner.   An MPEG-2 decoder model in YAPI has been presented which has more  parallelism and improved performance.  This model has further been  mapped onto SpaceCAKE architecture to study its architectural  parameters.  Detailed results obtained with YAPI simulation (target  architecture independent) and TSS simulation (after  process-processor binding) on MPEG-2 decoder application establish  the effectiveness of our approach.  15 Refs.

Title: Towards effective embedded processors in codesigns: Customizable  partitioned caches
Abstract: This paper explores an application-specific customization technique  for the data cache, one of the foremost area/power consuming and  performance determining microarchitectural features of modern  embedded processors.  The automated methodology for customizing the  processor microarchitecture that we propose results in increased  performance, reduced power consumption and improved determinism of  critical system parts while the fixed design ensures processor  standardization.  The resulting improvements help to enlarge the  significant role of embedded processors in modern hardware/software  codesign techniques by leading to increased processor utilization  and reduced hardware cost.  A novel methodology for static analysis  and a field-reprogrammable implementation of a customizable cache  controller that implements a partitioned cache structure is  proposed.  The simulation results show significant decrease of miss  ratio compared to traditional cache organizations.  12 Refs.

Title: Towards universal software substrate for distributed embedded systems
Abstract: This paper proposes universal software substrate that is able to be  used to build various types of distributed embedded systems.  The  universal software substrate contains an operating system and  several middleware components.  It offers universal application  programming interface(Universal API) that increases application's  portability extremely.  Also, it makes the development speed of  distributed embedded applications dramatically fast since the high  level abstraction provided by universal software substrate decreases the amount of software that should be written from scratch.  The most important issue of our research is how to control the level of  abstraction when designing distributed embedded systems.  Our work is looking for methodologies to build portable software for distributed embedded systems in a systematic way.  We describe several software  components towards realizing universal software substrate, and some  research topics for achieving the goals.  45 Refs.

Title: Using semantic knowledge of distributed objects to increase  reliability and availability
Abstract: As systems become more distributed, they also become more complex.  To ensure consistent execution while maximizing availability,  distributed applications use various mechanisms such as replication, load balancing, and data caching.  The protocols used for consistency management and component availability are traditionally instantiated by the application.  However, in distributed object-based  environments like CORBA or Java RMI, the infrastructure can often  determine adequate protocols to guarantee liveness and safety based  on the request and semantic knowledge of the application.  This paper discusses how semantic knowledge of distributed objects can help  implement intelligent behavior in middleware and choose optimal  protocols for distributed component interactions.  17 Refs.

Title: Architectural significant package (ASP): Fundamentals of  object-oriented architecture modeling for real-time embedded  applications
Abstract: Architecture modeling for real-time embedded applications presents a  challenging issue in object-oriented software development.  This  paper discusses the architectural modeling concepts and practices  through an example of a real-time embedded project.  During the  project, a practical concept - the Architectural Significant Package (ASP) has been developed.  Various ASPs are identified and integrated to form an architectural foundation for the project.  In addition to  the fundamental issues on identifying an ASP, this paper explores  how to integrate ASPs into a cohesive and reusable model.  Some  interesting observations on this engineering practice of using the  ASP approach will help to improve future architecture modeling in  the real-time embedded environment.  8 Refs.

Title: Config: A case study in combining software engineering techniques
Abstract: Config is a software component of the Graphical R-Matrix Atomic  Collision Environment.  Its development is documented as a case study combining several software engineering techniques: formal  specification, generic programming, object-oriented programming, and design by contract.  It is specified in VDM++; and implemented in  C++, a language which is becoming more than a curiosity amongst the  scientific programming community.  C++ supports object orientation, a powerful architectural paradigm in designing the structure of  software systems, and genericity, an orthogonal dimension to the  inheritance hierarchies facilitated by object oriented languages.   Support in C++ for design by contract can be added in library form.   The combination of techniques make a substantial contribution to the overall software quality.  (Author abstract) 32 Refs.

Title: Analysis of the IN call model suitability in the context of VoIP
Abstract: Packet networks are now considered as a potential network  infrastructure for providing telephony services.  Offering enhanced  services in today's networks largely relies on the use of  Intelligent Networks (IN).  Accessing IN services from packet  networks becomes an interesting challenge for transparently offering advanced services to end users, irrespective of the type of network  they use.  The compatibility of the IN call model with the call and  connection control procedures used in packet networks is the  prerequisite to achieve this goal.  This paper provides a detailed  compatibility analysis for the main architecture and protocols that  have been developed by standardization bodies to support telephony  over packet networks.

Title: Building a model for real-time simulation
Abstract: Real-time systems differ from traditional data processing systems in  that they are constrained by certain non-functional requirements  (e.g., timing requirements).  We have designed the Object-Oriented  Physical Multimodeling for Real-Time Simulation (OOPM/RT)  methodology in which real-time systems can be modeled to meet the  functional and non-functional requirements.  Two activities for  modeling real-time systems are defined in OOPM/RT: (1) the logical  architecture design activity, and (2) the physical architecture  design activity.  The logical architecture aims at producing a base  model that satisfies the functional requirements of the system.  The  physical architecture takes the base model into account and embraces the non-functional requirements.  Timing constraints are handled by  determining the level of abstraction with which the base model can  deliver simulation results by the given amount of time.  By  systematically handling simulation deadlines while minimizing the  modeler's interventions, OOPM/RT provides an efficient modeling  environment for real-time systems.  (Author abstract) 35 Refs.

Title: Concepts and architecture of a simulation framework based on the  JavaBeans component model
Abstract: We report on a combination of system theoretic simulation modeling  methodology with the JavaBeans component model as a basis for a  component-based simulation framework.  While system theory formalisms can serve as formal, mathematical foundations for modular,  hierarchical modeling and simulation, the JavaBeans component model  provides the appropriate implementation base.  The result of the  synergism is a powerful component-based simulation framework.  In  this paper we present the basic concepts and overall architecture of our JavaBeans modeling and simulation framework.  We review the  underlying system modeling formalisms for simulation modeling,  sketch the layered architecture of the framework, and show  elementary simulation programming and interface-based, hierarchical  coupling of simulation components in more detail.  Finally, we show  the current state of implementation and demonstrate how simulation  models can be developed using standard bean builder tools.  (Author  abstract) 27 Refs.

Title: Supporting learning in a shared design environment
Abstract: Design is a complex problem solving and knowledge refinement process.  Learning is a part of this process that can improve computer based  design support systems by using the knowledge representing the  experience and expertise of designers.  Learning from past design  examples, and acquiring new knowledge during the process of design  are closely related activities that must be supported by future  computer supported design systems.  This paper analyses the relation  between design and learning activity to propose a learning model of  design first.  Then it presents the software architecture of a design agent with an inductive learning mechanism.  Subsequently it  introduces the knowledge representation and learning algorithms in a multi-agent design system.  Finally, the paper examines the possible  ways in which the proposed learning model and the software  architecture can be placed in an industrial and engineering design  context for developing application tools for design support.

Title: Delay model and speculative architecture for pipelined routers
Abstract: This paper introduces a router delay model that accurately models key aspects of modern routers.  The model accounts for the pipelined  nature of contemporary routers, the specific flow control method  employed, the delay of the flow-control credit path, and the sharing of crossbar ports across virtual channels.  Motivated by this model,  we introduce a microarchitecture for a speculative virtual-channel  router that significantly reduces its router latency to that of a  wormhole router.  Simulations using our pipelined model give results  that differ considerably from the commonly-assumed  unit-latency'  model which is unreasonably optimistic.  Using realistic pipeline  models, we compare wormhole and virtual-channel flow control.  Our  results show that a speculative virtual-channel router has the same  per-hop router latency as a wormhole router, while improving  throughput by up to 40%.  (Author abstract) 11 Refs.

Title: Dynamic prediction of critical path instructions
Abstract: Modern processors come close to executing as fast as true dependences allow.  The particular dependences that constrain execution speed  constitute the critical path of execution.  To optimize the  performance of the processor, we either have to reduce the critical  path or execute it more efficiently.  In both cases, it can be done  more effectively if we know the actual instructions that constitute  that path.  This paper describes Critical Path Prediction for  dynamically identifying instructions likely to be on the critical  path, allowing various processor optimizations to take advantage of  this information.  We show several possible critical path prediction  techniques, and apply critical path prediction to value prediction  and clustered architecture scheduling.  We show that critical path  prediction has the potential to increase the effectiveness of these  hardware optimizations by as much as 70%, without adding greatly to  their cost.

Title: Register renaming and scheduling for dynamic execution of predicated  code
Abstract: To achieve higher processor performance requires greater synergy  between advanced hardware features and innovative compiler  techniques.  Recent advancement in compilation techniques for  predicated execution has provided significant opportunity in  exploiting instruction level parallelism.  However, little research  has been done on how to efficiently execute predicated code in a  dynamic microarchitecture.  In this paper, we evaluate hardware  optimizations for executing predicated code on a dynamically  scheduled microarchitecture.  We provide two novel ideas to improve  the efficiency of executing predicated code.  On a generic Intel  Itanium processor pipeline model, we demonstrate that, with some  microarchitecture enhancements, a dynamic execution processor can  achieve about 16% performance improvement over an equivalent static  execution processor.

Title: Study of high-performance reconfigurable constant coefficient  multiplier implementations
Abstract: The use of dynamic reconfiguration appears extremely attractive for  implementing adaptive processing algorithms.  Often, the adaption  involves updating look-up tables based on a parameter which can only be determined at run-time.  For reasons of efficiency, these look-up  tables are read-only to the rest of the circuitry.  This paper  compares the use of run-time reconfiguration and read-only look-up  tables, with similar implementations using writable memories.  The  application under consideration is the multi-layer perceptron neural network.  It is shown that the ROM based network is considerably  simpler than the RAM based network, at the expense of a dramatically increased time to update the weights during training.

Title: Design and implementation of FPGA based wavepipelined fast convolver
Abstract: In this paper a new parallel/serial convolver scheme with  wavepipelining is proposed first.  The design of the wavepipelined  (WP) convolver using FPGAs is considered next.  Convolvers with and  without wavepipelining are implemented using Xilinx XC4006E FPGAs  for convolving two sequences each with 8 bit accuracy and sequence  length 8. The convolver without wavepipelining requires 125 CLBs and permits a minimum sampling period of 176 nsec.  The WP convolver  requires 217 CLBs and permits a minimum sampling period of 92 nsec.   Further the multipliers in the WP convolver do not require the  latches and an ASIC for a large WP convolver can result in  significant savings in area and power.  Finally three schemes for  increasing the sampling rate of the WP convolver are suggested.   (Author abstract) 5 Refs.

Abstract: Data concealment using sub-band LSB coding, LSB coding is an  algorithm exhibiting good performance for hiding data within audio.

Title: Simulating evolution: Connectionist metaphors for studying human  cognitive behaviour
Abstract: The use of intelligent systems to perform computer simulation in  studying evolving behaviour is, we believe, beneficial for  researchers interested in understanding the complexity and behaviour of the algorithms used in simulating evolution through computational learning.  Intelligent Systems based on Connectionist Networks or  Connectionism use computer simulation to talk about human  consciousness, thought and evolution.  We present a cognitive  modelling study using neural networks, to simulate the children's  progression of language capabilities during the crucial two-year  period (9-24 months) of child language development.  We argue that in order to simulate the uniquely human language learning, it is  primarily important to assess the aptness of connectionist  architectures for cognitive modelling.  We provide a connectionist  interpretation to the basic aspects of cognition which are relevant  to the simulation of child language development, thereby providing a mapping of psycholinguistic notions to connectionist concepts.

Title: Efficient architectures and algorithms for multicasting data in  computer communication networks
Abstract: This paper presents two network architectures with associated routing and multicast algorithms for improved performance under multicasting traffic conditions.  A conditionally nonblocking network, referred to as a Clos network, forms the basis for the development of efficient  multicast communication networks.  The Clos network is first analyzed under multicast traffic conditions for blocking and multicast  overflow probability.  The analysis determines the overflow  probability under two different multicast distribution assumptions.   The first distribution assumes all packets request the same number  of copies and the second distribution uses a random number of  requested copies.  An analysis of an extension of the presented  network to multiplexed parallel planes of a network shows a  significant improvement on the network performance and particularly  on the carried traffic load when compared with previously published  multicast architectures using different buffering strategies. copy  2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Design and implementation of a bitstream parsing coprocessor for  MPEG-4 video system-on-chip solution
Abstract: In this paper, the hardware-oriented bitstream structure analysis and an efficient and flexible bitstream parsing processor are presented.  The analysis of MPEG-4 video bitstream structure based on RISC model explores requirement and design constraint for bitstream-level  processing.  It shows that conventional RISC is not efficient enough  for bitstream parsing.  An efficient instruction set optimized for  bitstream processing is designed and the hardware architecture can  be reconfigured for various applications.  Compared with 160 MOPS  required by a RISC, the proposed architecture needs only about 27  MOPS to parse an MPEG-4 video bitstream at high bit-rate as about 40 Mbit/s, which is about 6 times speedup.  The impact of the proposed  architecture on video applications is to enhance and extend the  processing for bit domain translation and related real time  applications.  7 Refs.

Title: System-level power/performance analysis for embedded systems design
Abstract: This paper presents a formal technique for system-level  power/performance analysis that can help the designer to select the  right platform starting from a set of target applications.  By  platform we mean a family of heterogeneous architectures that  satisfy a set of architectural constraints imposed to allow re-use  of hardware and software components.  More precisely, we introduce  the Stochastic Automata Networks (SANs) as an effective formalism  for average-case analysis that can be used early in the design cycle to identify the best power/performance figure among several  application-architecture combinations.  This information not only  helps avoid lengthy profiling simulations, but also enables  efficient mappings of the applications onto the chosen platform.  We  illustrate the features of our technique through the design of an  MPEG-2 video decoder application.  18 Refs.

Title: Speeding up control-dominated applications through microarchitectural customizations in embedded processors
Abstract: We present a methodology for microarchitectural customization of  embedded processors by exploiting application information, thus  attaining the twin benefits of processor standardization and  application-specific customization.  Such powerful techniques enable  increased application fragments to be placed on the processor, with  no sacrifice in system requirements, thus reducing the custom  hardware and the concomitant area requirements in SOCs.  We  illustrate these ideas through the branch resolution problem, known  to impose severe performance degradation on control-dominated  embedded applications.  A low-cost late customizable hardware that  uses application information to fold out a set of frequently  executed branches is described.  Experimental results show that for a representative set of control dominated applications a reduction in  the range of 7%-22% in processor cycles can be achieved, thus  extending the scope of low-cost embedded processors in complex  co-designs for control intensive systems.  12 Refs.

Title: Parallelizing DSP nested loops on reconfigurable architectures using  data context switching
Abstract: Reconfigurable architectures promise significant performance and  flexibility advantages over conventional architectures.  Automatic  mapping techniques that exploit the features of the hardware are  needed to leverage the power of these architectures.  In this paper,  we develop techniques for parallelizing nested loop computations  from digital signal processing (DSP) applications onto high  performance pipelined configurations.  We propose a novel data  context switching technique that exploits the embedded distributed  memory available in reconfigurable architectures to parallelize such loops.  Our technique is demonstrated on two diverse state-of-the-art reconfigurable architectures, namely, Virtex and the Chameleon  Systems Reconfigurable Communications Processor.  Our techniques show significant performance improvements on both architectures and also  perform better than state-of-the-art DSP and microprocessor  architectures.  5 Refs.

Title: A methodology for architecture-oriented rapid prototyping
Abstract: In this paper a methodology for architecture oriented Rapid  Prototyping is presented.  In the very early development phases  concept-oriented Rapid Prototyping is used to clarify the  requirements between the customer and the contractor.  In the second, more complex phase of Rapid Prototyping, the architecture of the  target system is used.  So this kind of Rapid Prototyping is called  "architecture-oriented Rapid Prototyping".  Most Electronic Control  Units (ECU) use microcontrollers with plenty of on-chip peripherals, sometimes application-specific microcontrollers with non-standard  peripherals are used.  But then, all these peripheral components must be present in the Rapid Prototyping system.  To obtain this we  developed an interface module with a FPGA for the peripheral parts  of microcontroller based designs as well as a prototyping ECU which  can be programmed with CASE-tools.  13 Refs.

At the mobile level, this kind of data oriented content  requires highly efficient architectures; and nowadays embedded  system-on-chip solutions will no longer be able to manage the  critical constraints like area, power and data computing efficiency.  In this paper we will propose a new dynamically reconfigurable  network, dedicated to data oriented applications such as the one  targeted for instance on third generation networks.

Title: Distributed multi-resolution data integration using mobile agents
Abstract: We describe the use of the mobile agent paradigm to design an  improved infrastructure for data, integration in Distributed Sensor  Network (DSN).  We use the acronym MADSN to denote the proposed  Mobile-Agent-based DSN.  Instead of moving data to processing  elements for data integration, as is typical of a client/server  paradigm, MADSN moves the processing code to the data locations.   This saves network bandwidth and provides an effective means for  overcoming network latency, since large data transfers are avoided.   We study two important problems related to MADSN design - the  distributed integration problem, and the optimum performance  problem.  Compared to DSNs, a mobile-agent implementation of  multi-resolution data integration saves up to 90% of the data  transfer time.  For a given set of network parameters, we analyze the conditions under which MADSN performs better than DSN and determine  the condition under which MADSN reaches its optimum performance  level.  19 Refs.

Collision avoidance and reconfiguration  simulations were performed for a cluster of four satellites.   ObjectAgent is now being ported to C++ for demonstration on a  real-time, distributed testbed and deployment on TechSat 21 in 2003.  The present architecture runs on a PowerPC 750 running Enea's OSE  operating system.

Title: A partial-result-reuse architecture and its design technique for  morphological operations
Abstract: This paper proposes a new cost-effective architecture for  mathematical morphology named Partial-Result-Reuse (PRR)  architecture.  For a lot of real-time applications of mathematical  morphology, the hardware implementation is necessary; however, the  hardware cost of almost existing morphology architectures is too  high when dealing with large structuring elements.  With  partial-result-reuse concept and self-affinity property of general  structuring elements, the proposed architecture is more  cost-effective and more general than existing morphology  architectures.  It can deal with morphological operations with  arbitrary structuring elements and can be used for other semi-group  operations, and only 2 [log//2 n]  comparators are needed for nxn structuring elements.  Simulation  shows this architecture can dramatically reduce hardware cost of  morphological operations with all kinds of structuring elements.  11  Refs.

Title: Analytical exploration of power efficient data-reuse transformations  on multimedia applications
Abstract: Power savings that can be achieved by data-reuse decisions targeting  at a custom memory hierarchy for multimedia applications executing  on embedded cores are examined in this paper.  Exploiting the  temporal locality of memory accesses in data-intensive applications  a set of data-reuse transformations on a typical motion estimation  algorithm is determined.  The aim is to reduce data related power  consumption by moving background memory accesses to smaller  foreground memories, which are less power costly.  The impact of  these transformations on power, performance and area is evaluated  both for application specific circuits and general purpose  processors.  The number of data and instruction memory accesses is  analytically calculated, enabling a fast exploration of the design  space by varying algorithmic parameters.  6 Refs.

Title: Data and instruction memory exploration of embedded systems for  multimedia applications
Abstract: A methodology for power optimization of the data memory hierarchy and instruction memory, is introduced.  The effect of the methodology on  a set of widely used multimedia application kernels, namely Full  Search (FS), Hierarchical Search (HS), and Parallel Hierarchical One Dimension Search (PHODS), is demonstrated.  Three different target  architecture models are used.  The issues of the data memory power  reduction and instruction memory are tackled separately.  We find the power optimal data memory hierarchy applying the appropriate  data-use transformation, while the instruction power optimization is done using suitable cache memory.  Using data-reuse transformations,  performance optimizations techniques, and instruction-level  transformations, we perform exhaustive exploration of all the  possible alternatives to reach power efficient solutions.  The  experimental results prove the efficiency of the methodology in  terms of power for all the multimedia kernels.  10 Refs.

Abstract: The new MPEG-4 Audio standard provides two toolsets for synthetic  Audio generation, Audio processing and multimedia content  description called Structured Audio (SA) and BInary Format for  Scenes (BIFS).  Moving from a systematic analysis of SA and from the  implementation of an efficient SA decoder, this paper describes the  design of a virtual DSP architecture able to exploit the data level  parallelism contained in many typical audio processing algorithms.   The proposed virtual DSP architecture shows good performance on  general purpose platforms and can be easily adapted and optimized  for parallel superscalar devices.  The porting and results on a V-LIW DSP device confirm the effectiveness and flexibility of the  approach, particularly suitable for standalone embedded solutions.   14 Refs.

Title: Area-efficient high speed decoding schemes for turbo/map decoders
Abstract: Turbo decoders inherently have a large latency and low throughput due to iterative decoding.  To increase the throughput and reduce the  latency, high speed decoding schemes have to be employed.  In this  paper, following a discussion on basic parallel decoding  architectures, two types of area-efficient parallel decoding schemes are proposed.  Detailed comparison on storage requirement, number of  computation units and the overall decoding latency is provided for  various decoding schemes with different levels of parallelism.   Hybrid parallel decoding schemes are proposed as an attractive  solution for very high level parallelism implementations.  Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed area-efficient parallel  decoding schemes introduce no performance degradation in general.   The application of the pipeline-interleaving technique to parallel  Turbo decoding architectures is presented at the end.  9 Refs.

Title: Formalizing the specification of model integrated program synthesis  environments
Abstract: Model integrated computing (MIC) is an effective and efficient method for developing, maintaining, and evolving large-scale computer-based systems (CBSs).  One approach to MIC is to synthesize application  programs from domain-specific models created using customized, model integrated program synthesis (MIPS) environments.  The MultiGraph  Architecture is a toolset for creating graphical domain-specific  MIPS environments (DSMEs).  By modeling the syntactic, semantic, and  presentation requirements of a DSME, a metamodel is formed and used  to synthesize the DSME itself, enabling design environment evolution in the face of changing domain requirements.  Because both the  domain-specific applications and the DSME are designed to evolve,  efficient and safe large-scale computer-based systems development is possible over the entire lifetime of the CBS.  This paper presents a  method to represent DSME requirements using UML class diagrams and  predicate logic constraint language expressions, and discusses  automatic transformation of metamodel specifications into DSMEs.  15  Refs.

These self-adaptive  systems can be designed and implemented using Model-Integrated  Computing.  To represent dynamic software architectures, the system  is modeled in a generative manner.  Here, the components of the  architecture are prepared, but their number and connectivity  patterns are not fully defined at design time.  Instead, an  algorithmic description and architectural parameters are provided  that specify how the architecture could be generated "on-the-fly".   These design-time models are then embedded in the run-time system  along with generators that configure/reconfigure the system by  changing certain architectural parameters.  9 Refs.

Title: Graph-theoretic fault tolerance for spacecraft bus avionics
Abstract: Introducing new analytic results, we minimize the cost of  point-to-point fault tolerant avionics architectures.  Refining the  graph model of Hayes, we formulate the worst-case feasibility of  configuration as: What (f+1)-connected n-vertex graphs with fewest  edges minimize the maximum radius or diameter**4 of subgraphs (i.e., quorums) induced by deleting up to f of the n vertices? We solve  this problem by proving: i) K-cubes (cubes based on cliques) can  tolerate a greater proportion of faults than can traditional C-cubes (cubes based on cycles); ii) quorums formed from K-cubes have a  diameter that is asymptotically equal to the Moore bound, while  under no conditions of scaling can the Moore bound be attained by  C-cubes whose radix exceeds 4. Thus, for fault tolerance logarithmic in n, K-cubes are optimal, whereas C-cubes are suboptimal.  Our  exposition also corrects and generalizes a mistaken claim by  Armstrong and Gray [19] concerning binary  cubes.  36 Refs.

Title: One trillion operations per second on-board VLSI signal processor for Discovered II space based radar
Abstract: A high-performance low-power radar signal processor is being  developed for the Discoverer II space-based radar application.  The  signal processor will perform real-time ground moving target  indication (GMTI) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) front-end  signal processing functions, which significantly reduces the  downlink communication bandwidth.  In order to minimize the signal  dispersion, The wideband receive signal is first channelized into  multiple digital subbands and all the subsequent processing tasks  including beamforming, pulse compression, and space-time adaptive  processing (STAP) are done in the subband domain.  In order to meet  over one trillion operations per second (Teraops) computational  throughput requirement with low power consumption and small form  factor, a highly optimized scalable VLSI bit-level systolic array  technology is used.  The 1 Teraops on-board processor is currently  projected to consume less than 50 watts and to be less than 1/8  cubic foot and 12 kg.  7 Refs.

Title: Software architecture themes in JPL's mission data system
Abstract: The rising frequency of NASA mission launches has highlighted the  need for improvements leading to faster delivery of mission software without sacrificing reliability.  In April 1998 Jet Propulsion  Laboratory (JPL) initiated the Mission Data System (MDS) project to  rethink the mission software lifecycle-from early mission design to  mission operation-and make changes to improve software architecture  and software development processes.  As a result, MDS has defined a  unified flight, ground, and test data system architecture for space  missions based on object-oriented design, component architecture,  and domain-specific frameworks.  This paper describes several  architectural themes shaping the MDS design and how they help meet  objectives for faster, better, cheaper mission software.  7 Refs.

Title: Specification and enforcement of object-oriented RBAC model
Abstract: Access control for protection and sharing of information and physical resources is an essential component of any multi-user computer  systems.  Role-Based-Access-Control (RBAC) has been introduced and  has offered a powerful means of specifying access control decisions, as well as reducing the cost of administrating access control  policies and making them less error-prone.  In this paper, we  proposed an object-oriented RBAC model (ORBAC) and its formal  specifications to describe the relationships of the basic elements  of the model.  Furthermore, an efficient ORBAC implementation method  was proposed to deal with statically and dynamically role  authorization so that the problem of seperation of duties can be  solved.  8 Refs.

Title: Context-based media adaptation in pervasive computing
Abstract: In Pervasive Computing applications, computer embedded devices are  used to perform control tasks and access the Internet or other  information sources.  However, most content of current information  sources was designed with desktop computers and high-speed network  connections in mind.  They contain rich media data, which are not  suitable for those pervasive devices with limited capabilities.   Moreover, for different user preference and application scenarios,  not all of the data are relevant and critical to the application.   Context-based media adaptation is mainly concerned with selecting  different qualities of single media types or selecting different  media types, and then delivering information to different context.   In this paper, some related issues for building a general  context-based media adaptation framework will be discussed.  These  issues include context description and exchange schemes, adaptable  model for managing and manipulating multimedia content, adaptation  techniques and architectural issues.  11 Refs.

Title: An object-oriented analysis and design approach for safe object  sharing
Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel object-oriented analysis and design  (OOAD) approach to protect shared objects in complex systems from  undesirable access.  Recently shared object protection is paid more  attention to and several approaches are proposed.  They give us good  solutions to implement protection domains for shared objects.   However, these approaches are applicable only when protection  domains are easily found in the architecture of applications, such  as secure information systems.  Without this condition, it remains  problem how we design protection domains and how we validate its  correctness.  To cope with this problem, we propose an approach to  analyze protection domains from scenarios.  The result of the  analysis is used to check implementation.  23 Refs.

Title: Formal guides for experimentally verifying complex  software-implemented fault tolerance mechanisms
Abstract: In this paper we describe a framework allowing the experimental  verification of complex software-implemented fault-tolerance  algorithms and mechanisms (FTAMs).  This framework takes into account two of the most important aspects which are increasingly required in newly developed fault-tolerant systems: the considerations of  COTS-based (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf) architectures and the  compliance with severe safety certification procedures.  The strategy proposed shows how a rigorous FTAM specification, based in a  multiple viewpoint architectural description, may help to  mechanically monitoring the verification of its implementation under real conditions.  The strategy proposed has been instantiated using  two mechanized techniques: model-checking and fault-injection.  The  preliminary conclusions of the application of this automated  approach to a small part of a commercial fault-tolerant system, help us clarify its usage and its suitability for validating complex  dependable systems.  22 Refs.

Title: Innovative data collection techniques for roadside origin-destination surveys
Abstract: Described are the results of a pilot application intended to automate the data collection and data reduction phases of roadside  origin-destination (O-D) studies.  Most techniques used to obtain O-D data are quite labor intensive, during both the data collection and  the data reduction phase.  Frequently, they result in extensive data  quality checks and long turn-around periods between the data  collection work and the submittal of the corresponding survey  report.  The application described automates the data collection and  data reduction phases by using portable, handheld data collection  devices.  These devices can be connected to a desktop or laptop  computer to transfer the O-D data to a depository database.  Included are a brief background discussion, a description of the hardware and software used and the design and development of O-D applications, a  description of two applications of the handheld data collection  devices, and a list of lessons learned.  6 Refs.

Title: Overview on a formal model of architecture/circuit trade-offs for the implementation of fast processors
Abstract: Implementation complexity is playing an increasingly important role  in the development of high-speed microprocessors, in terms of  limitations to the actual cycle time.  It is useful for the CPU  architecture designer to have an assessment of the achievable cycle  time when making architecture design decisions.  Formal models exist  that allow the designer to have an accurate estimation of the best  possible delay of logic units before doing circuit and layout  design.  The combination of such modeling techniques together with  instruction-level cycle-accurate simulation of the CPU architecture  can be a powerful tool for the development of fast processors. copy  2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Performance prediction of N-body simulations on a hybrid architecture
Abstract: Hybrid Architectures consist of Special Purpose Devices (SPD) used in conjunction with parallel computers.  They have the potential of  being a major computing tool for various applications of  Computational Science.  Mapping the application tasks to the hybrid  machine is not trivial, and bottlenecks can arise quite easily.   Performance Modeling is a suitable method to tackle this problem.   The performance model presented here simulates the activity of  GRAPE, a very powerful SPD used in Computational Astrophysics, in  conjunction with a general purpose host.  We show how our model  faithfully reproduces the behaviour of the real hybrid machine.  We  also present some examples of how our model can be used to predict  performance improvements. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  20 Refs.

Abstract: Apple has decided to discontinue the production of Cube computer  systems.  Cube had a very attractive design and won may prizes.  The  computer failed to gain market due to high cost and little scope for future expansions.  Some cracks were also found on the body and there was rumours that the clear plastic sleeves gave off flumes.  Adobe  has also launched version 5 of Acrobat.  This version contains some  new features like sharing of PDF files and the contents.  The PDF  files can be converted into a single Tiff, JPeg, or PNG format and  vice-versa.  There are options for password protecting documents with 128 bit encryption.  It also supports digital signature technology  from third parties like Entrust, Verisign, and CIC through plug-ins.

Title: A heuristic algorithm for dynamic task scheduling in highly parallel computing systems
Abstract: In this paper we have introduced the K1 heuristic algorithm for  dynamic task scheduling with precedence constraints and  communication delays.  The execution of a task set repeats in cycles, while the execution and communication profile of a task set changes  in time.  During a task set execution, a new schedule is generated by tuning the previous schedule.  The scheduling is distributed -  performed on the processors of a highly parallel computer  architecture.  Only the tasks that can have an influence on dominant  sequence reduction are considered for reordering/migration. The  applied techniques are load balancing, task reordering, and  data-wait reduction.  We have analyzed the impact of the K1  scheduling cost on response time.  The simulation results show that  the periodic activation of the K1 scheduler significantly decreases  the scheduling overhead and still generates much better response  time than that of a fixed schedule

Title: Efficient local memory sequence generation for data parallel programs using permutations
Abstract: Generating local memory access sequence is a critical issue in  distributed-memory implementations of data-parallel languages.  In  this paper, for arrays distributed block-cyclically on multiple  processors, we introduce a novel approach to the local memory access sequence generation using the theory of permutation.  By compressing  the active elements in a block into an integer, called compress  number, and exploiting the fact that there is a repeating pattern in the access sequence, we obtain the global block cycle.  Then, we show that the local block cycle can be efficiently enumerated as closed  forms using the permutation of global block cycle.  After  decompressing the compress number in the local block cycle, the  local block patterns are restored and the local memory access  sequence can be quickly generated.  Unlike other works, our approach  incurs no run-time overhead. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All  rights reserved.  14 Refs.

Title: Discourse particles and discourse functions
Abstract: Spoken language, especially spoken German, is rich in particles that  do not contribute to the propositional content of utterances, but  play important roles in steering the flow of the dialogue and in  conveying various attitudes and expectations of the speaker.   Languages differ widely in their conventions on particle usage, and  therefore these words pose significant problems for translation.  As  a solution, we propose an inventory of "discourse functions" that  characterize the pragmatic impact of particles.  These functions are  to be assigned to particles in the analysis phase, so that the  translation step can use the abstract information to decide on the  best way of rendering the same effect in the target-language  utterance.  23 Refs.

Title: The EUTRANS-I spoken language translation system
Abstract: The EUTRANS project aims at using example-based approaches for the  automatic development of Machine Translation systems accepting text  and speech input for limited-domain applications.  During the first  phase of the project, a speech-translation system that is based on  the use of automatically learned subsequential transducers has been  built.  This paper contains a detailed and mostly self-contained  overview of the transducer-learning algorithms and system  architecture, along with a new approach for using categories  representing words or short phrases in both input and output  languages.  Experimental results using this approach are reported for a task involving the recognition and translation of sentences in the hotel-reception communication domain, with a vocabulary of 683 words in Spanish.  A translation word-error rate of 1.97% is achieved in  real-time factor 2.7 on a Personal Computer.  31 Refs.

Title: Memory expansion Technology (MXT): software support and performance
Abstract: A novel memory subsystem called Memory Expansion Technology (MXT) has been built for fast hardware compression of main-memory content.   This allows a memory expansion to present a "real" memory larger  than the physically available memory.  This paper provides an  overview of the memory-compression architecture, its OS support  under Linux and Windows registered trademark , and an analysis of  the performance impact of memory compression.  Results show that the  hardware compression of main memory has a negligible penalty  compared to an uncompressed main memory, and for memory-starved  applications it increases performance significantly.  We also show  that the memory content of an application can usually be compressed  by a factor of 2. 14 Refs.

Title: IBM memory expansion technology (MXT)
Abstract: Several technologies are leveraged to establish an architecture for a low-cost, high-performance memory controller and memory system that  more than double the effective size of the installed main memory  without significant added cost.  This architecture is the first of  its kind to employ real-time main-memory content compression at a  performance competitive with the best the market has to offer.  A  large low-latency shared cache exists between the processor bus and  a content-compressed main memory.  High-speed, low-latency hardware  performs real-time compression and decompression of data traffic  between the shared cache and the main memory.  Sophisticated memory  management hardware dynamically allocates main-memory storage in  small sectors to accommodate storing the variable-sized compressed  data without the need for "garbage" collection or significant wasted space due to fragmentation.  Though the main-memory compression ratio is limited to the range 1:1-64:1, typical ratios range between 2:1  and 6:1, as measured in "real-world" system applications.  8 Refs.

Title: Algorithms and data structures for compressed-memory machines
Abstract: A overview of a set of algorithms and data structures developed for  compressed-memory machines is given.  These include 1) very fast  compression and decompression algorithms, for relatively small  fixed-size lines, that are suitable for hardware implementation; 2)  methods for storing variable-size compressed lines in main memory  that minimize overheads due to directory size and storage  fragmentation, but that are simple enough for implementation as part of a system memory controller; 3) a number of operating system  modification required to ensure that a compressed-memory machine  never runs out of memory as the compression ratio changes  dynamically.  This research was done to explore the feasibility of  computer architectures in which data are decompressed/compressed on  cache misses/writebacks.  The results led to and were implemented in  IBM Memory Expansion Technology (MXT), which for typical systems  yields a factor of 2 expansion in effective memory size with  generally minimal effect on performance.  30 Refs.

Abstract: There has been increasing concern in recent years that the limits of  what can be achieved with current approaches to improving device  performance will soon be reached.  Quantum-dot cellular automata  (QCA) have been proposed as a means of getting around these  limitations.  This paper reviews the work done concerning QCA to  date.  First, the QCA architecture is described along with a model  used for calculating their properties.  Next, the approach to  computing with QCA by implementing QCA analogs to traditional logic  devices will be discussed.  Issues that affect the performance of  these devices and the experimental work that has been done are  summarized.  Finally, some interesting QCA applications are reviewed. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  72 Refs.

Title: A VLSI array architecture for realization of DFT, DHT, DCT and DST
Abstract: A unified array architecture is described for computation of DFT,  DHT, DCT and DST using a modified CORDIC (coordinate rotation  digital computer) arithmetic unit as the basic processing element  (PE).  All these four transforms can be computed by simple  rearrangement of input samples.  Compared to five other existing  architectures, this one has the advantage in speed in terms of  latency and throughput.  Moreover, the simple local neighborhood  interprocessor connections make it convenient for VLSI  implementation.  The architecture can be extended to compute  transformation of longer length by judicially cascading the modules  of shorter transformation length which will be suitable for wafer  scale integration (WSI).  CORDIC is designed using transmission gate  logic (TGL) on sea of gates semicustom environment.  Simulation  results show that this architecture may be a suitable candidate for  low power/low voltage applications. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.   All rights reserved.  18 Refs.

Title: PDA based navigation system for a 3D environment
Abstract: Navigation systems are an important application in the field of  mobile computing.  In order to increase the usability of navigation  systems it is desirable to present information in a form that is  most informative for the user.  This paper deals with the possibility of presenting the information in a 3D form that provides the user  with more information than information in a 2D form.  A concept of  such a navigation system is described together with all the partial  problems that have to be solved.  The result of the project is the  implementation of a system that is fully functional and could be  used in various applications.  The structure of the system is very  flexible, allowing the substitution of some software modules by  hardware solutions. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.  All rights  reserved.  5 Refs.

Title: Genetic algorithm driven hardware-software partitioning for  dynamically reconfigurable embedded systems
Abstract: The need for inexpensive, compact and adaptive systems prompted  considerable interest in the hardware-software co-design of embedded systems.  In particular, Dynamically Reconfigurable Embedded Systems, which exploit the advances in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)  technology, facilitate customisation of their hardware resources  during runtime to meet the demands of executing applications.  The  ability to estimate the resultant acceleration obtained is highly  desirable, as time to market deadlines are being ever shortened.  The performance of such systems is fundamentally dependent on the  hardware-software partition.  In this paper, a genetic  algorithm-based (GA) hardware-software partitioning method is  presented.  Demonstrative applications are used to illustrate the  effectiveness of the GA approach at exploiting the inherent  reconfigurable nature of such systems to obtain optimal or near  optimal performance speedup relative to a conventional software  implementation. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Fault-tolerant 176 Gbit Solid State Mass Memory architecture
Abstract: This paper presents a new Solid State Mass Memory (SSMM) suitable for space applications.  The memory reliability is increased by using two different approaches.  Firstly, memory mass fault-tolerance, with respect to hard failures, is obtained by using a fine-granularity hierarchical structure with a certain level of redundancy.  A second strategy used for facing soft errors is based on Error Correction Codes (ECC) and periodic memory washing.  A performance index has been developed for evaluating the main parameters of the SSMM architecture.  This index takes into account the ECC capability, the memory weight and reliability, allowing to relate them to the required overhead

Title: Dynamic load balancers for a multithreaded multiprocessor system
Abstract: Designing multi-processor systems that deliver a reasonable  price-performance ratio using off-the-shelf processor and compiler  technologies is a major challenge.  For an important class of  applications, it is critical to explore fine-grain parallelism to  achieve reasonable performance.  In such parallel systems it is  essential to efficiently manage communication latencies, bandwidth,  and synchronization overheads.  In this paper we study load balancing strategies for the runtime system of a multi-threaded system.  EARTH  (Efficient Architecture for Running Threads) is a multi-threaded  programming and execution model that supports fine-grain,  non-preemptive, threads in a distributed memory environment.  We  describe the design and implementation of a set of dynamic load  balancing algorithms, and study their performance in  divide-and-conquer, regular, and irregular applications.  Our  experimental study on the distributed memory multi-processor IBM  SP-2 indicate that a randomized load balancer perform as well as,  and often better than, history based load balancers.  28 Refs.

Title: An architecture of fusing communication and execution for global  distributed processing
Abstract: We are pursuing the FUCE architecture project at Kyushu University.   FUCE means FUsion of Communication and Execution.  The main objective of our research is, as the name shows, to develop a new architecture that truly fuses communication and computation.  The FUCE project  develops a new on-chip-multi-processor and kernel software on it.  We name the processor FUCE processor, and the kernel software as CEFOS  (Communication and Execution Fusion OS).  The FUCE processor is  designed as a network node processor to perform mainly  switching/transmitting of messages/transaction and handling its  contents.  FUCE processor architecture is designed as a  multiprocessor-on-chip to support the fine-grain multi-threading.   The kernel software CEFOS is also developed on the concept of  multi-threading.  User and system processes are constructed as a set  of threads, which are executed concurrently according to thread  dependences.  13 Refs.
