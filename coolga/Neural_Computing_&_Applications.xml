The methodology is based on the Lagrange multiplier theory in optimisation,         and seeks to provide solutions satisfying the necessary conditions of optimality. The equilibrium point of the network satisfies         the Kuhn&amp;#8211;Tucker condition for the problem. The stability and convergency of the neural network is investigated, and the strategy         of the neural optimisation is discussed. The feasibility of the neural network method is verified with the computation examples.         Results of the simulation of the neural network to solve optimum problems are presented to illustrate the computational power         of the neural network method.      </content></document><document><year>1999</year><authors>A.

The method consists of a classification         step, where the motion of small patches is recovered through an optimisation approach, and a segmen-tation step merging neighbouring         patches characterised by the same motion. Classification of motion is performed without optical flow computation. Three-dimensional         motion parameter estimates are obtained directly from the spatial and temporal image gradients by minimising an appropriate         energy function with a Hopfield-like neural network. Network convergence is accelerated by integrating the quantitative estimation         of the motion parameters with a qualitative estimate of dominant motion using the geometric theory of differential equations.      </content></document><document><year>1999</year><authors>J.P.F.

The recurrent neural network structure is inspired by the model proposed by Williams         and Zipser, with a modified backpropagation algorithm. The input signal is processed by a nonlinear predistorter which reduces         the warping effect. The received output signal is passed through a postdistorter to compensate for the warping and clustering         effects produced by an amplifier. The proposed scheme yields a significant improvement when it is compared to the system without         predistortion-postdistortion, perform-ance is evaluated in terms of the bit error rate and output signal constellation.      </content></document><document><year>1999</year><authors>S.

The tested algorithms are the         Simple Competitive Learning (SCL) algorithm and the Frequency-Sensitive Competitive Learning (FSCL) algorithm. Both, SCL and         FCSL are the simplest adaptive methods based, respectively, on minimising the distortion and on the search for a uniform quantisation.         The aim of this paper is to study several computational properties of these methods when applied to non-stationary clustering         as adaptive vector quantisation algorithms. Non-stationary colour quantisation is, therefore, representative of the more general         class of non-station-ary clustering problems. We expect our results to be meaningful for other algorithms that involve either         the minimisation of the distortion or the search for uniform quantisers. We study experimentally the effect of the size of         the image sample employed in the one-pass adaptation, their robustness to initial conditions, and the effect of local versus         global scheduling of the learning rate.      </content></document><document><year>1999</year><authors>A.B.

The second part discusses the basic capabilities of the learning system on a typical benchmark problem,         where a special focus lies on the quality of the acquired control law. The application to a highly nonlinear chemical reactor         and to an instable multi-output system shows the ability of the proposed neural control architecture to learn even difficult         control strategies from scratch.      </content></document><document><year>1999</year><authors>J.

In this article, we apply both network techniques to predict the catches of the Prionace Glauca (a class of shark) and the Katsowonus Pelamis (a variety of tuna, more commonly known as the Skipjack). We have developed an application that will help reduce the search time for good fishing zones and thereby increase the fleets competitivity. Our results show that, thanks to their superior learning and generalisation capacities, functional networks are more efficient than ANNs. Our data proceeds from remote sensors. Their spectral signatures allow us to calculate products that are useful for ecological modelling. After an initial phase of digital image processing, we created a database that provides all the necessary patterns to train both network types.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>A.

Firstly, the optimal regressor of a linear ARX model is identified by minimising Akaikes final prediction error (FPE). This regressor is then used as the input vector of a fully connected feedforward neural network with one hidden layer of ten units and one output unit. Results show that the NNARX model outperforms the linear model considerably: the sum of the squared error (SSE) is 15.0479 with the ARX model and 2.0632 with the NNARX model. The optimal network topology is subsequently determined by pruning the fully connected network according to the optimal brain surgeon (OBS) strategy. With this procedure near 73% of connections were removed and, as a result, the performance of the network has been improved: the SSE is equal to 0.9060.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>T.

In a discrete-event simulation framework, simulation of complex neural behaviours, such as phase precession and phase arbitration, demands the prediction of delayed firing times. The new technique, the incremental partitioning method, uses linear envelopes of the state variable of a neuron to partition the simulated time so that the delayed-firing time is reliably calculated by applying the bisection-combined Newton-Raphson method to every partition. The quick filtering technique is also proposed for reducing calculation cost of linear envelopes. The simulator developed, Punnets, has achieved efficiency and precision, but is still capable of simulating a complex behaviour of large-scale neural network models.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Ioannis Anagnostopoulos1 | Christos Anagnostopoulos2 | George Kouzas1  | Dimitrios D.

To process huge data sets, many learning algorithms based on neural networks for PCA have been proposed. However, traditional algorithms are not globally convergent. In this paper, a new PCA learning algorithm based on cascade recursive least square (CRLS) neural network is proposed. This algorithm can guarantee the network weight vector converges to an eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of the input covariance matrix globally. A rigorous mathematical proof is given. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the algorithm.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Takumi Ichimura1 | Shinichi Oeda2 | Machi Suka3  | Katsumi Yoshida3 </authors><title>A learning method of immune multi-agent neural networks</title><content>Many different learning algorithms for neural networks have been developed, with advantages offered in terms of network structure, initial values of some parameters, learning speed, and learning accuracy. If we train the networks only on good examples, without noise and shortage, the neural network can be trained to classify, with reasonable accuracy, target patterns or random patterns, but not both. To solve this problem, we propose a learning method of immune multi-agent neural networks (IMANNs), which have agents of macrophages, B-cells and T-cells. Each agent employs a different type of neural network. Because the agents work cooperatively and competitively, IMANNs can automatically classify the training dataset into some subclasses. In this paper, two types of IMANNs are described and their classification capabilities are compared. In order to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we used two datasets: the dataset of the MONKs problem (as a traditional classification problem) and a dataset from a medical diagnosis problem (hepatobiliary disorders).</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Romesh Ranawana1  | Vasile Palade1 </authors><title>A neural network based multi-classifier system for gene identification in DNA sequences</title><content>The paper presents a neural network based multi-classifier system for the identification of Escherichia coli promoter sequences in strings of DNA. As each gene in DNA is preceded by a promoter sequence, the successful location of an E. coli promoter leads to the identification of the corresponding E. coli gene in the DNA sequence. A set of 324 known E. coli promoters and a set of 429 known non-promoter sequences were encoded using four different encoding methods. The encoded sequences were then used to train four different neural networks. The classification results of the four individual neural networks were then combined through an aggregation function, which used a variation of the logarithmic opinion pool method. The weights of this function were determined by a genetic algorithm. The multi-classifier system was then tested on 159 known promoter sequences and 171 non-promoter sequences not contained in the training set. The results obtained through this study proved that the same data set, when presented to neural networks in different forms, can provide slightly varying results. It also proves that when different opinions of more classifiers on the same input data are integrated within a multi-classifier system, we can obtain results that are better than the individual performances of the neural networks. The performances of our multi-classifier system outperform the results of other prediction systems for E. coli promoters developed so far.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Selcuk Soyupak1 | Feza Karaer2| Hasan G&amp;uuml rb&amp;uuml z3| Ersin Kivrak3| Engin Sent&amp;uuml rk4 | Ali Yazici5</authors><title>A neural network-based approach for calculating dissolved oxygen profiles in reservoirs</title><content>A Neural Network (NN) modelling approach has been shown to be successful in calculating pseudo steady state time and space dependent Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentrations in three separate reservoirs with different characteristics using limited number of input variables.

Pre-processing before training and post processing after simulation steps were the treatments applied to raw data and predictions respectively. Generalisation was improved and over-fitting problems were eliminated: Early stopping method was applied for improving generalisation. The correlation coefficients between neural network estimates and field measurements were as high as 0.98 for two of the reservoirs with experiments that involve double layer neural network structure with 30 neurons within each hidden layer. A simple one layer neural network structure with 11 neurons has yielded comparable and satisfactorily high correlation coefficients for complete data set, and training, validation and test sets of the third reservoir.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>M.

In this approach, measurements that characterize the behavior of the circuit under test are first selected. The best candidates of circuit parameters for tuning are also determined. A training set comprising the selected circuit measurements is then constructed. These measurements are calculated during simulations in which the circuit parameter values are uniformly distributed in a tolerance region around their nominal values. The training set is fed to a self organizing map neural network to cluster the measurements. The generated clusters are manipulated and classified via a hierarchical circuit tuning procedure. Based on this classification, tuning values for the tuning parameters are calculated. Situations in which the circuit cannot be tuned are also addressed. Experimental results indicate that the developed approach provides a robust and efficient technique for circuit tuning.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Daniel Neagu1  | Vasile Palade2</authors><title>A neuro-fuzzy approach for functional genomics data interpretation and analysis</title><content>The paper is concerned about the application of neuro-fuzzy techniques for the functional analysis of gene expression data from microarray experiments.

Both image and local features values feed a Kohonen self-organised feature map (SOFM) neural network classifier. After training, the neurons of the output competition layer of the SOFM define a first approach of the final classes. Using the content of these classes, fuzzy membership functions are obtained that are next used by the fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm in order to obtain the colours of the final document. The method can be applied to greyscale and colour documents; it is suitable for improving blurring and badly illuminated documents and can be easily modified to accommodate any type of spatial characteristics.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>D.-X.

With all genetic operations of GA including selection, crossover, mutation and evaluation implemented with NN modules, this approach can realize in parallel genetic operations on the whole chromosome to achieve the maximum parallel realization potential of the MGG model of the GA. At the same time expensive hardware for field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) and the high speed memory of hardware for GA can be avoided. The performance of our solution is validated with a suite of benchmark test functions.

The estimation of the model order using cross-validation may be a long process.         In this paper, we investigate alternative methods to cross-validation, based on nonlinear dynamics methods, namely Grassberger&amp;#8211;Procaccia,         KГ©gl, Levina&amp;#8211;Bickel and False Nearest Neighbors algorithms. The experiments have been performed in two different ways. In         the first case, the model order has been used to carry out the prediction, performed by a SVM for regression on three real         data time series showing that nonlinear dynamics methods have performances very close to the cross-validation ones. In the         second case, we have tested the accuracy of nonlinear dynamics methods in predicting the known model order of synthetic time         series. In this case, most of the methods have yielded a correct estimate and when the estimate was not correct, the value         was very close to the real one.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Jia-Jun Wong1  | Siu-Yeung Cho1 </authors><title>A face emotion tree structure representation with probabilistic recursive neural network modeling      </title><content>This paper describes a novel structural approach to recognize the human facial features for emotion recognition. Conventionally,         features extracted from facial images are represented by relatively poor representations, such as arrays or sequences, with         a static data structure. In this study, we propose to extract facial expression features vectors as Localized Gabor Features         (LGF) and then transform these feature vectors into FacE Emotion Tree Structures (FEETS) representation. It is an extension         of the Human Face Tree Structures (HFTS) representation presented in (Cho and Wong in Lecture notes in computer science, pp         1245&amp;#8211;1254, 2005). This facial representation is able to simulate as human perceiving the real human face and both the entities and relationship         could contribute to the facial expression features. Moreover, a new structural connectionist architecture based on a probabilistic         approach to adaptive processing of data structures is presented. The so-called probabilistic based recursive neural network         (PRNN) model extended from Frasconi et al. (IEEE Trans Neural Netw 9:768&amp;#8211;785, 1998) is developed to train and recognize human emotions by generalizing the FEETS representation. For empirical studies, we benchmarked         our emotion recognition approach against other well known classifiers. Using the public domain databases, such as Japanese         Female Facial Expression (JAFFE) (Lyons et al. in IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell 21(12):1357&amp;#8211;1362, 1999; Lyons et al. in third IEEE international conference on automatic face and gesture recognition, 1998) database and Cohn&amp;#8211;Kanade AU-Coded Facial Expression (CMU) Database (Cohn et al. in 7th European conference on facial expression         measurement and meaning, 1997), our proposed system might obtain an accuracy of about 85&amp;#8211;95% for subject-dependent and subject-independent conditions.         Moreover, by testing images having artifacts, the proposed model significantly supports the robust capability to perform facial         emotion recognition.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Syed Zafar Ali1 | Muhammad Ahmad Choudhry2 </authors><title>A generalized higher order neural network for aircraft recognition in a video docking system      </title><content>In modern world of today where air traffic is continuously increasing and available space at the airports remains finite,         there is a problem of safe docking of aircraft. The problem needs to be solved to ensure safe and smooth movement of aircraft,         passengers and crew while making optimum utilization of available ground space. Without such systems having in place, accidents         keep occurring due to human judgment errors. These accidents are causing loss of material costs and human injury.

The results are compared by presenting         data to neural networks while deforming the shape, adding noise and partly occluding the shape and presenting those angles         for which network was not trained.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>OtГЎvio A.

The neural         model is made up of two self-organizing map nets&amp;#8212;one on top of the other&amp;#8212;and a single-layer perceptron. It has application         into domains which require time series analysis. The model is compared to a mutilated architecture of it, and to a multilayer         perceptron. The hierarchical, the mutilated, and the multilayer perceptron models are trained and assessed on load data extracted         from a North-American electric utility. They are required to predict either once every week or once every month the electric         peak-load during the next two years. The results from the experiments show that the performance of HHNM on long-term load         forecasts is better than that of the mutilated model, and much better than that of the MLP model.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Jyh-shyan Lan1 | Victor L.

These are especially important considerations for neural network models developed to estimate the posterior         probabilities of group membership used in classification decisions. This paper explores the issues of asymmetric misclassification         costs and unbalanced group sizes on neural network classification performance using an artificial data approach that is capable         of generating more complex datasets than used in prior studies and which adds new insights to the problem and the results.         A different performance measure, that is capable of directly measuring classification performance consistency with Bayes decision         rule, is used. The results show that both asymmetric misclassification costs and imbalanced group sizes have significant effects         on neural network classification performance both independently and via interaction effects. These are not always intuitive;         they supplement prior findings, and raise issues for the future.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Gao Guo1 | Jiang-She Zhang2  | Gai-Ying Zhang2 </authors><title>A method to sparsify the solution of support vector regression      </title><content>Although the solution of support vector machine is relatively sparse, it makes unnecessarily liberal use of basis functions         since the number of support vectors required typically grows linearly with the size of the training set.

We have designed an adaptive motion control approach based on a novel recurrent neural network, called Echo state networks.         The advantage is that no knowledge about the dynamic model is required, and no synaptic weight changing is needed in presence         of time varying parameters in the robot. To generate the robot behavior over time, we adopted a biologically inspired approach         called neural fields. Due to its dynamical properties, a neural field produces only one localized peak that indicates the         optimum movement direction, which navigates a mobile robot to its goal in an unknown environment without any collisions with         static or moving obstacles.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Ching-Hsue Cheng1 | Tai-Liang Chen2 | Liang-Ying Wei1| 3  | Jr-Shian Chen4 </authors><title>A new e-learning achievement evaluation model based on RBF-NN and similarity filter      </title><content>As Internet rises fast in recent decades, teaching and learning tools based on Internet technology are rapidly applied in         education. Learning through Internet can make learners absorb knowledge without the limitations on learning time and distance.         Therefore, in academy, e-learning is one of the popular learning assistant instruments. Recently, &amp;#8220;student-centered&amp;#8221; instruction         has become one of the primary approaches in education, and the e-learning system, which can provide the learning environment         of personalization and adaptability, is more and more popular. By using e-learning system, teachers can adjust the learning         schedule instantly for learners according to their learning achievements, and build more adaptive learning environments. However,         in some cases, bias assessments are given for student achievements under specific uncontrollable conditions (i.e. tiredness,         preference). In dire need of overcoming this predicament, a new model based on radial basis function neural networks (RBF-NN)         and similarity filter to evaluate learning achievements is proposed. The proposed model includes three phases to reduce bias         assessments: (1) preprocess: select important features (attributes) to enhance classification performance by feature selection         methods and utilize minimal entropy principle approach (MEPA) to fuzzify the quantitative data, (2) similarity filter: select         linguistic values for each feature and delete inconsistent data by the similarity threshold (similarity filter) and (3) construct         classification model and accuracy evaluation: build the proposed model based on RBF-NN and evaluate model performance. To         verify the proposed model, a practical achievement dataset, collected from e-learning online examination system in a university         of Taiwan, is used as experiment dataset, and the performance of the proposed model is compared with the listing models in         this paper. From the empirical study, it is shown that the proposed model provided more proper achievement evaluations than         the listing models.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Xu-Lei Yang1 | Qing Song1| Yi-Lei Wu1 | Ai-Ze Cao2</authors><title>A novel pruning approach for robust data clustering      </title><content>In this paper, we make an effort to overcome the sensitivity of traditional clustering algorithms to noisy data points (noise         and outliers). A novel pruning method, in terms of information theory, is therefore proposed to phase out noisy points for         robust data clustering. This approach identifies and prunes the noisy points based on the maximization of mutual information         against input data distributions such that the resulting clusters are least affected by noise and outliers, where the degree         of robustness is controlled through a separate parameter to make a trade-off between rejection of noisy points and optimal         clustered data. The pruning approach is general, and it can improve the robustness of many existing traditional clustering         methods. In particular, we apply the pruning approach to improve the robustness of fuzzy c-means clustering and its extensions,         e.g., fuzzy c-spherical shells clustering and kernel-based fuzzy c-means clustering. As a result, we obtain three clustering         algorithms that are the robust versions of the existing ones. The effectiveness of the proposed pruning approach is supported         by experimental results.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Qijian Chen1 | Yuanchang Zhong1  | Xiaohong Zhang2 </authors><title>A pseudo genetic algorithm      </title><content>Random individual initialization tends to generate too many eccentric and homogeneous individuals which cause slow and premature         convergence. It needs many operations (selection strategy, incest prevention and mutation) to fix, which consume too much         computation and lose many good genes. The proposed complementary-parent strategy initializes every other pair of parents with         dynamically or statically complementary chromosomes (such as 010101&amp;#8230;0101 and 101010&amp;#8230;1010). Crossover of every generation is         only performed between the offspring from the same parents, during which the parents are completely replaced by their own         children. Higher population diversity is got without gene lost at all, by which search ability is enhanced. Incest prevention,         selection strategies and mutation are unnecessary and consequently cancelled (so it is named pseudo genetic algorithm). As         indicated by the simulation results, the speed of elitist search is accelerated greatly and computation complexity is reduced         by half.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Mu-Chun Su1  | Yu-Xiang Zhao2</authors><title>A variant of the SOM algorithm and its interpretation in the viewpoint of social influence and learning      </title><content>The conventional self-organizing feature map (SOM) algorithm is usually interpreted as a computational model, which can capture         main features of computational maps in the brain. In this paper, we present a variant of the SOM algorithm called the SOM-based         optimization (SOMO) algorithm. The development of the SOMO algorithm was motivated by exploring the possibility of applying         the SOM algorithm in continuous optimization problems. Through the self-organizing process, good solutions to an optimization         problem can be simultaneously explored and exploited by the SOMO algorithm. In our opinion, the SOMO algorithm not only can         be regarded as a biologically inspired computational model but also may be regarded as a new approach to a model of social         influence and social learning. Several simulations are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithm.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>JosГ© Antonio PГ©rez1 | Manuel GonzГЎlez1 | Daniel Dopico1</authors><title>Adaptive neurofuzzy ANFIS modeling of laser surface treatments      </title><content>This paper introduces a new ANFIS adaptive neurofuzzy inference model for laser surface heat treatments based on the Green&amp;#8217;s         function.

It is well known that gradient-based learning         algorithms such as backpropagation algorithm have good ability of local search, whereas PSO has good ability of global search.         Therefore, in the improved approach, the APSO algorithm encoding the first-order derivative information of the approximated         function is used to train network to near global minima. Then, with the connection weights produced by APSO, the network is         trained with a modified gradient-based algorithm with magnified gradient function. The modified gradient-based algorithm can         reduce input-to-output mapping sensitivity and lessen the chance of being trapped into local minima. By combining APSO with         local search algorithm and considering a priori information, the improved approach has better approximation accuracy and convergence         rate. Finally, simulation results are given to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>JosГ© de JesГєs Rubio1  | Jaime Pacheco1</authors><title>An stable online clustering fuzzy neural network for nonlinear system identification      </title><content>In this paper, we propose a online clustering fuzzy neural network.

Contingency analysis         is examined from two perspectives: as a functional approximation problem obtaining a numerical evaluation and ranking contingencies;         and as a graphical monitoring problem, obtaining an easy visualization system of the relative severity of the contingencies.         For the functional evaluation problem, we analyze the use of different supervised feed-forward artificial neural networks         (multilayer perceptron and radial basis function networks). The proposed systems produce a very accurate evaluation and ranking,         and so present a high applicability. For the graphical monitoring problem, unsupervised artificial neural networks such as         self-organizing maps by Kohonen have been used. This solution allows both a rapid, easy and simultaneous visualization of         the severity level of the complete contingency set. The proposed solutions avoid the main drawbacks of previous neural network         approaches to this problem, which are explicitly analyzed here.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Zaiming Liu1 | Jun Peng1 </authors><title>Delay-independent stability of stochastic reaction&amp;#8211;diffusion neural networks with Dirichlet boundary conditions      </title><content>This paper deals with the problem of global stability of stochastic reaction&amp;#8211;diffusion recurrent neural networks with continuously         distributed delays and Dirichlet boundary conditions.

Multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) architectures were formulated and         used as basis for detection of variabilities of ECG signals.

In this paper, a three-dimensional         dynamic finite element model is built to evaluate the effects of pulley misalignment. The model consists of a pulley and a         segment of V-ribbed belt in contact with the pulley. A material model of belt, including rubber compound and reinforcing cord         is developed. Multiple rubber layers are each considered hyperelastic with distinct material characterization parameters.

The models are implemented in the commercial code ABAQUS/Explicit to simulate the misalignment of the belt&amp;#8211;pulley         system. The developed model is first validated by experimental measurements of pulley lateral force due to misalignment.

The prediction accuracy of chaotic time series is extremely dependent on the model and the learning algorithm. In addition,         the generalization property of the proposed models trained by limited observations is of great importance. In the past two         decades, singular or descriptor systems and related fuzzy descriptor models have been the subjects of interest due to their         many practical applications in modeling complex phenomena. In this study fuzzy descriptor models, as a more recent neurofuzzy         realization of locally linear descriptor systems, which have led to the introduction of intuitive incremental learning algorithm         that is called Generalized Locally Linear Model Tree algorithm, are implemented in their optimal structure to be compared         with several other methods. A simple but efficient technique, based on the error indices of multiple validation sets, is used         to optimize the number of neurons as well as to prevent over fitting in the incremental learning algorithms. The aim of the         paper is to demonstrate the advantages of fuzzy descriptor models and to make a fair comparison between the most successful         neural and neurofuzzy approaches in their best structures according to prediction accuracy, generalization, and computational         complexity.

This paper proposes a spline         wavelet support vector machine (SWSVM) to forecast the volatility of financial time series based on generalized autoregressive         conditional heteroscedasticity model. An admissible spline wavelet kernel is constructed by incorporating the wavelet technique         and spline theory into support vector machine (SVM). Since spline wavelet function can yield features that describe the stock         time series both at various locations and at varying time granularities, the SWSVM gains the cluster feature of volatility         well. Compared with Gaussian kernel in the standard SVM, the applicability and validity of spline wavelet kernel in SWSVM         are confirmed through computer simulations and experiments on real-world stock data.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Giovanni Acampora1 | Matteo Gaeta2  | Vincenzo Loia1 </authors><title>Hierarchical optimization of personalized experiences for e-Learning systems through evolutionary models      </title><content>Recent researches in e-Learning area highlight the need to define novel and advanced support mechanism for commercial and         academic organizations in order to enhance the skills of employees and students and, consequently, to increase the overall         competitiveness in the new economy world. This is due to the unbelievable velocity and volatility of modern knowledge that         require novel learning methods which are able to offer additional support features as efficiency, task relevance and personalization.

It has been seen that the variations between the images of a person, under varying pose, facial expressions,         illumination, etc., are quite high. Therefore, in face recognition problem to achieve high recognition rate, it is necessary         to consider the structural information lying within these images in the classification process. In the present study, it has         been realized by modeling each of the training images as a hidden layer neuron in the proposed RBFNN. Now, to classify a facial         image, a confidence measure has been imposed on the outputs of the hidden layer neurons to reduce the influences of the images         belonging to other classes. This process makes the RBFNN as self-adaptive for choosing a subset of the hidden layer neurons,         which are in close neighborhood of the input image, to be considered for classifying the input image. The process reduces         the computation time at the output layer of the RBFNN by neglecting the ineffective radial basis functions and makes the proposed         method to recognize face images in high speed and also in interframe period of video. The performance of the proposed method         has been evaluated on the basis of sensitivity and specificity on two popular face recognition databases, the ORL and the         UMIST face databases. On the ORL database, the best average sensitivity (recognition) and specificity rates are found to be         97.30 and 99.94%, respectively using five samples per person in the training set. Whereas, on the UMIST database, the above         quantities are found to be 96.36 and 99.81%, respectively using eight samples per person in the training set. The experimental         results indicate that the proposed method outperforms some of the face recognition approaches.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Sang Soo Kim1 | Yoo Shin Kim1  | Il Kyu Eom1 </authors><title>Image interpolation using MLP neural network with phase compensation of wavelet coefficients      </title><content>When interpolating images in the wavelet domain, the main problem is how to estimate the finest detail coefficients. Wavelet         coefficients across scales have an interscale dependency, and the dependency varies according to the local energy of the coefficients.         This implies the possible existence of functional mappings from one scale to another scale. If we can estimate the mapping         parameters from the observed coefficients, then it is possible to predict the finest detail coefficients. In this article,         we use the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks to learn a mapping from the coarser scale to the finer scale. When         exploiting the MLP neural networks, phase uncertainty, a well-known drawback of wavelet transforms, makes it difficult for         the networks to learn the interscale mapping. We solve this location ambiguity by using a phase-shifting filter. After the         single-level phase compensation, a wavelet coefficient vector is assigned to one of the energy-dependent classes. Each class         has its corresponding network. In the simulation results, we show that the proposed scheme outperforms the previous wavelet-domain         interpolation method as well as the conventional spatial domain methods.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Maosen Cao1| 2| 3| Pizhong Qiao1| 2  | Qingwen Ren1</authors><title>Improved hybrid wavelet neural network methodology for time-varying behavior prediction of engineering structures      </title><content>An improved neuro-wavelet modeling (NWM) methodology is presented, and it aims at improving prediction precision of time-varying         behavior of engineering structures. The proposed methodology distinguishes from the existing NWM methodology by featuring         the distinctive capabilities of constructing optimally uncoupled dynamic subsystems in light of the redundant Haar wavelet         transform (RHWT) and optimizing neural network. In particular, two techniques of imitating wavelet packet transform of RHWT         and reconstructing the major crests of power spectrum of analyzed data are developed with the aim of constructing the optimally         uncoupled dynamic subsystems from time-varying data. The resulting uncoupled dynamic subsystems make the underlying dynamic         law of time-varying behavior more tractable than the raw scale subwaves arose from the RHWT, and they provide a platform for         multiscale modeling via individual modeling at the uncoupled dynamic subsystem level. Furthermore, on each uncoupled dynamic         subsystem, the technique of optimal brain surgeon in conjunction with a new dynamic mechanism refreshing is employed to optimize         the neural network, and the recombination of the modeling outcomes on every subsystem constitutes the overall modeling of         time-varying behavior. The improved NMW methodology offers a feasible framework of multiscale modeling due to its flexibility,         adaptability and rationality, and it is particularly useful for prediction applications of time-varying behavior of engineering         structures. As an illustrative example, the improved NWM methodology is applied to model and forecast dam deformation, and         the results show that the methodology possesses positive advantages over the existing multiscale and single scale modeling         techniques. The improved NMW methodology is promising and valuable for the safety monitoring and extreme event warning of         engineering structures.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Prasun Das1 </authors><title>In search of best alternatives: a TOPSIS driven MCDM procedure for neural network modeling      </title><content>Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) is an approach to rank the alternatives with respect to the different attributes.

The purpose of this study was to establish a computed tomography (CT) based three-dimensional assistant plastic surgery systems,         which can provide the patients with realistic prediction of their own postoperative appearance in computer and specifically         produce a nose implant for an individual patient. Preoperative CT data and 3D reconstruction techniques were employed to generate         3D model of the patient&amp;#8217;s skull. 3D collision detection and finite elements model deformation were then applied to simulate         nose augmentation surgery and predict postoperative appearance. According to the patient&amp;#8217;s expectation, digital models of         the nose implants were constantly modified. When the patient is satisfied with the simulated results, custom made silicone         implants were produced by a computer controlled device. Accurately regeneration of 3D images and realistic operative simulations         could be achieved with this system. The implants produced exactly conformed to the results of simulation. No curving and reshaping         were needed during operating. The clinical results extremely matched with the simulations. The system enhances surgeon patient         communication and facilitates preoperative planning. It is especially desirable for implant surgery with less guesswork of         size, contour, and orientation of the implant. The best chance of optimal results could be achieved.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Jun-Bao Li1 | Jeng-Shyang Pan2  | Zhe-Ming Lu3 </authors><title>Kernel optimization-based discriminant analysis for face recognition      </title><content>The selection of kernel function and its parameter influences the performance of kernel learning machine.

The traditional changing         only the kernel parameters method will not change the data distribution in the empirical feature space, which is not feasible         to improve the performance of kernel learning. This paper applies kernel optimization to enhance the performance of kernel         discriminant analysis and proposes a so-called Kernel Optimization-based Discriminant Analysis (KODA) for face recognition.         The procedure of KODA consisted of two steps: optimizing kernel and projecting.

To explore the basis of how interconnected cortical cells are locally activated by such inputs, we theoretically         analyze the local excitation patterns elicited by external input stimuli by using a one-dimensional neural field model. We         examine the conditions for the existence and stability of the local excitation solutions under arbitrary time-invariant inputs         and establish a graphic analysis method that can detect all steady local excitation solutions and examine their stability.         We apply this method to a case where a pair of supra- and subthreshold stimuli are applied to nearby positions in the field.         The results demonstrate that there can exist bistable local excitation solutions with different lengths and that the local         excitation exhibits hysteretic behavior when the relative distance between the two stimuli is altered.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Moleykutty George1 | Kartik Prasad Basu2 | Alan Tan Wee Chiat1</authors><title>Model reference controlled separately excited DC motor      </title><content>This research article proposes the speed control of a separately excited DC motor (SEDM) in the constant torque region.

However, the multi-criteria and imprecise nature of the fire safety attributes in buildings has caused difficulties         in quantifying the fire safety level. Further to the previous works, the author presented a fuzzy synthetic evaluation system         for computing the fire risk ranking of buildings. It could serve for multi-level fire safety assessment framework. Linguistic         terms were adopted instead of subjective numerical values. A two-level evaluation model, including fuzzy optimal classification         model and linear weighted mean model, was developed to facilitate the synthetic process. A case of fire safety ranking in         high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong was presented for illustration purpose.

Only the remaining distance and projection of swing angle are applied to design         the fuzzy controller. No plant information of crane is necessary in this approach. Therefore, the proposed method greatly         reduces the computational efforts. Several experiments illustrated the encouraging effectiveness of the proposed method through         a scaled 3D crane model.

In terms of how each ensemble system solves the problem, we can roughly categorize the existing ensemble mechanism               into two groups: data-driven and model-driven ensembles. The former engenders diversity to ensemble members by manipulating               the data, while the latter realizes ensemble diversity by manipulating the component models themselves. Within a neural network               ensemble, standard back-propagation (BP) networks are usually used as a base component. However, in this article, we will               use our previously designed improved circular back-propagation (ICBP) neural network to establish such an ensemble. ICBP differentiates               from BP network not only because an extra anisotropic input node is added, but also more importantly, because of the introduction               of the extra node, it possesses an interesting property apart from the BP network, i.e., just through directly assigning different sets of values 1 and &amp;#8722;1 to the weights connecting the extra node to all the hidden nodes, we can construct               a set of heterogeneous ICBP networks with different hidden layer activation functions, among which we select four typical               heterogeneous ICBPs to build a dynamic classifier selection ICBP system (DCS-ICBP). The system falls into the category of               model-driven ensemble. The aim of this article is to explore the relationship between the explicitly constructed ensemble               and the diversity scale, and further to verify feasibility and effectiveness of the system on classification problems through               empirical study. Experimental results on seven benchmark classification tasks show that our DCS-ICBP outperforms each individual               ICBP classifier and surpasses the performance of combination of ICBP using the majority voting technique, i.e. majority voting               ICBP system (MVICBP). The successful simulation results validate that in DCS-ICBP we provide a new constructive method for               diversity enforcement for ICBP ensemble systems.            </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>GГјlay Ozkan1 | Levent UГ§an2 | GГ¶ksel Ozkan2 </authors><title>The prediction of SO2 removal using statistical methods and artificial neural network      </title><content>Artificial neural network and a statistical model have been applied in a laboratory scale trickle bed reactor (TBR) to investigate         the SO2 removal efficiency of activated carbon. The performance of artificial neural network (ANN) model has been compared with the         statistical model based on central composite experimental design. Two independent variables, which affect the amount of SO2 removal by the liquid phase in the TBR, were selected; namely liquid flow rate and gas flow rate. Amount of SO2 removal was chosen as the dependent variable (target data). A second order statistical model has been considered to show         the dependence of the amount of SO2 removal on the operating parameters. A back-propagation ANN has been used to develop a model relating to the amount of SO2 removal. A series of experiments have been conducted on the basis of the statistics-based design of experimental method. It is observed that a neural network architecture having one input layer with two neurons, one hidden layer with three neurons,         one output layer with one neuron and an epoch size of 20 gives better prediction. The predictions are more accurate than those         obtained from regression models.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Ning Sun1| 2 | Zhen-hai Ji2| Cai-rong Zou2 | Li Zhao2</authors><title>Two-dimensional canonical correlation analysis and its application in small sample size face recognition      </title><content>In the traditional canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-based face recognition methods, the size of sample is always smaller         than the dimension of sample. This problem is so-called the small sample size (SSS) problem. In order to solve this problem,         a new supervised learning method called two-dimensional CCA (2DCCA) is developed in this paper. Different from traditional         CCA method, 2DCCA directly extracts the features from image matrix rather than matrix to vector transformation. In practice,         the covariance matrix extracted by 2DCCA is always full rank. Hence, the SSS problem can be effectively dealt with by this         new developed method. The theory foundation of 2DCCA method is first developed, and the construction method for the class-membership         matrix Y which is used to precisely represent the relationship between samples and classes in the 2DCCA framework is then         clarified. Simultaneously, the analytic form of the generalized inverse of such class-membership matrix is derived. From our         experiment results on face recognition, we clearly find that not only the SSS problem can be effectively solved, but also         better recognition performance than several other CCA-based methods has been achieved.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>William A.

We use a causal index analysis of our trained ANN to identify rules that explain the         relationships between the selected features and the identity of each worm.

In this study, a comparative analysis of independent component analysis (ICA) and PCA for correction of ECG signals         is carried out by removing noise and artifacts from various raw ECG data sets. PCA and ICA scatter plots of various chest         and augmented ECG leads and their combinations are plotted to examine the varying orientations of the heart signal. In order         to qualitatively illustrate the recovery of the shape of the ECG signals with high fidelity using ICA, corrected source signals         and extracted independent components are plotted. In this analysis, it is also investigated if difference between the two         kurtosis coefficients is positive than on each of the respective channels and if we get a super-Gaussian signal, or a sub-Gaussian         signal. The efficacy of the combined PCA&amp;#8211;ICA algorithm is verified on six channels V1, V3, V6, AF, AR and AL of 12-channel         ECG data. ICA has been utilized for identifying and for removing noise and artifacts from the ECG signals. ECG signals are         further corrected by using statistical measures after ICA processing. PCA scatter plots of various ECG leads give different         orientations of the same heart information when considered for different combinations of leads by quadrant analysis. The PCA         results have been also obtained for different combinations of ECG leads to find correlations between them and demonstrate         that there is significant improvement in signal quality, i.e., signal-to-noise ratio is improved. In this paper, the noise         sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the PCA method is evaluated by examining the effect of noise, base-line wander and         their combinations on the characteristics of ECG for classification of true and false peaks.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Satchidan|a Dehuri1  | Sung-Bae Cho2 </authors><title>A comprehensive survey on functional link neural networks and an adaptive PSO&amp;#8211;BP learning for CFLNN      </title><content>Functional link neural network (FLNN) is a class of higher order neural networks (HONs) and have gained extensive popularity         in recent years.

We show through experimental results and comparisons         that higher accuracy values can be reached for color video sequences that represent typical situations critical for moving         object detection.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>D.

When knowledge about the relationship among         the various parameters of manufacturing are found to be lacking, ANNs are used as process models, because they can handle         strong nonlinearities, a large number of parameters and missing information. When the dependencies between parameters become         noninvertible, the input and output configurations used in ANN strongly influence the accuracy. However, running of a neural         network is found to be time consuming. If genetic algorithm-based ANNs are used to construct models, it can provide more accurate         results in less time. This article proposes a genetic algorithm-based ANN model for the turning process in manufacturing Industry.         This model is found to be a time-saving model that satisfies all the accuracy requirements.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Wen Yao1 | Xiaoqian Chen1 | Wencai Luo1</authors><title>A gradient-based sequential radial basis function neural network modeling method      </title><content>Radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is widely used in nonlinear function approximation. One of the key issues in         RBFNN modeling is to improve the approximation ability with samples as few as possible, so as to limit the network&amp;#8217;s complexity.         To solve this problem, a gradient-based sequential RBFNN modeling method is proposed. This method can utilize the gradient         information of the present model to expand the sample set and refine the model sequentially, so as to improve the approximation         accuracy effectively. Two mathematical examples and one practical problem are tested to verify the efficiency of this method.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Jin Tian1 | Minqiang Li1  | Fuzan Chen1 </authors><title>A hybrid classification algorithm based on coevolutionary EBFNN and domain covering method      </title><content>A new hybrid scheme of the elliptical basis function neural network (EBFNN) model combined with the cooperative coevolutionary         algorithm (Co-CEA) and domain covering method is presented for multiclass classification tasks. This combination of the Co-CEA         EBFNN (CC-EBFNN) and the domain covering method is proposed to enhance the predictive capability of the estimated model. The         whole training process is divided into two stages: the evolutionary process, and the heuristic structure refining process.         First, the initial hidden nodes of the EBFNN model are selected randomly in the training samples, which are further partitioned         into modules of hidden nodes with respect to their class labels. Subpopulations are initialized on modules, and the Co-CEA         evolves all subpopulations to find the optimal EBFNN structural parameters. Then the heuristic structure refining process         is performed on the individual in the elite pool with the special designed constructing and pruning operators. Finally, the         CC-EBFNN model is tested on six real-world classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository, and experimental         results illustrate that the EBFNN model can be estimated in fewer evolutionary trials, and is able to produce higher prediction         accuracies with much simpler network structures when compared with conventional learning algorithms.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Shiwei Yu1 | Kejun Zhu1 | Siwei Gao1</authors><title>A hybrid MPSO-BP structure adaptive algorithm for RBFNs      </title><content>This paper introduces a novel hybrid algorithm to determine the parameters of radial basis function neural networks (number         of neurons, centers, width and weights) automatically.

Then according to the located motion, we choose a corresponding         region in the former frame of the two successive frames, where watermark is embedded by using the quantization index modulation         algorithm.

However, image colors strongly depend on lighting geometry (direction and intensity of         light source) and illuminant color (spectral power distribution). Either small variation in the intensity or the change of         scene illumination can dramatically make object color changed. To overcome the lighting dependency problem, a color constancy         or normalization algorithm should be used for preprocessing. This paper presents a novel approach to performing color normalization.         A nonlinear mapping function is estimated using a neural network. Once the mapping function is found accurately, an image         under unknown illumination may be transformed to the image under the predetermined illumination, which will be useful for         color image processing. Three groups of experiments were conducted. In our experiments, images are processed by various neural         networks and the performance is boosted by using a committee machine, and then the mapping errors are estimated and the results         are compared with those of other algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method         is superior to that of other color normalization algorithms.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Shahrul Nizam Yaakob1 | C.

The model is constructed based on fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) and the quality threshold clustering         principle. The main objective of EQTAM is to overcome the effects of training data sequences on FAM and, at the same time,         to improve its classification performance. Several artificial data sets and benchmark medical data sets are used to evaluate         the effectiveness of the proposed model. Performance comparisons between EQTAM and ARTMAP-based as well as other classifiers         are made. From the experimental results, it can be observed that EQTAM is able to produce good results. More importantly,         the performance of EQTAM is robust against the effect of training data orders or sequences.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Xiaoqin Zeng1 | Jing Shao1 | Yingfeng Wang2  | Shuiming Zhong1 </authors><title>A sensitivity-based approach for pruning architecture of Madalines      </title><content>Architecture design is a very important issue in neural network research. One popular way to find proper size of a network         is to prune an oversize trained network to a smaller one while keeping established performance. This paper presents a sensitivity-based         approach to prune hidden Adalines from a Madaline with causing as little as possible performance loss and thus easy compensating         for the loss. The approach is novel in setting up a relevance measure, by means of an Adalines&amp;#8217; sensitivity measure, to locate         the least relevant Adaline in a Madaline. The sensitivity measure is the probability of an Adaline&amp;#8217;s output inversions due         to input variation with respect to overall input patterns, and the relevance measure is defined as the multiplication of the         Adaline&amp;#8217;s sensitivity value by the summation of the absolute value of the Adaline&amp;#8217;s outgoing weights. Based on the relevance         measure, a pruning algorithm can be simply programmed, which iteratively prunes an Adaline with the least relevance value         from hidden layer of a given Madaline and then conducts some compensations until no more Adalines can be removed under a given         performance requirement. The effectiveness of the pruning approach is verified by some experimental results.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Lukasz Wiklendt1 | Stephan Chalup1 | Rick Middleton1</authors><title>A small spiking neural network with LQR control applied to the acrobot      </title><content>+;&amp;#955;)-evolution strategy without recombination, and neurons&amp;#8217; parameters, were chosen         to roughly approximate biological neurons.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Dilek Funda Kurtulus1 </authors><title>Ability to forecast unsteady aerodynamic forces of flapping airfoils by artificial neural network      </title><content>The ability of artificial neural networks (ANN) to model the unsteady aerodynamic force coefficients of flapping motion kinematics         has been studied.

As a result, simulators that integrate spike coding and artificial or real-world platforms are scarce. In this paper,         we present artificial intelligence simulator of cognition, a software simulator designed to explore the computational power         of pulsed coding at the level of small cognitive systems. Our focus is on convivial graphical user interface, real-time operation         and multilevel Hebbian synaptic adaptation, accomplished through a set of non-linear dynamic weights and on-line, life-long         modulation. Inclusions of transducer and hormone components, intrinsic oscillator and several learning functions in a discrete         spiking neural algorithm are distinctive features of the software. Additional features are the easy link between the production         of specific neural architectures and an artificial 2D-world simulator, where one or more animats implement an input&amp;#8211;output         transfer function in real-time, as do robots in the real world.

In this paper, an online pruning strategy is proposed to participate         in the learning process of two constructive networks, i.e. fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) and fuzzy ARTMAP with dynamic decay adjustment         (FAMDDA), and the resulting hybrid networks are called FAM/FAMDDA with temporary nodes (i.e. FAM-T and FAMDDA-T, respectively).         FAM-T and FAMDDA-T possess a capability of reducing the network complexity online by removing unrepresentative neurons. The         performances of FAM-T and FAMDDA-T are evaluated and compared with those of FAM and FAMDDA using a total of 13 benchmark data         sets. To demonstrate the applicability of FAM-T and FAMDDA-T, a real fault detection and diagnosis task in a power plant is         tested. The results from both benchmark studies and real-world application show that FAMDDA-T and FAM-T are able to yield         satisfactory classification performances, with the advantage of having parsimonious network structures.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Fengli Ren1  | Jinde Cao1 </authors><title>Anti-synchronization of stochastic perturbed delayed chaotic neural networks      </title><content>This paper studies the anti-synchronization of a class of stochastic perturbed chaotic delayed neural networks.

This paper investigates         the efficiency of an emotional neural network, which uses a modified back propagation learning algorithm. The modifed algorithm,         namely the emotional BP learning algorithm, has two emotional parameters, anxiety and confidence, that are modeled during         machine learning and decision making. The emotional neural network will be implemented to a facial recognition problem using         images of faces with different orientations and contrast levels, and its performance will be compared to that of a conventional         neural network. Experimental results suggest that artificial emotions can be successfully modeled and efficiciently implemented         to improve neural networks learning and generaliztion.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Lei Gu1  | Hui-zhong Wu1</authors><title>Applying a novel decision rule to the sphere-structured support vector machines algorithm      </title><content>The traditional sphere-structured support vector machines algorithm is one of the learning methods.

Numerous methods, including the autoregressive integrated-moving         average (ARIMA) model and artificial neural networks can make accurate forecasts based on historical data. The seasonal ARIMA         (SARIMA) model and artificial neural networks can also handle data involving trends and seasonality. Although neural networks         can make predictions, deciding the most appropriate input data, network structure and learning parameters are difficult. Therefore,         this article presents a hybrid forecasting method that combines the SARIMA model and neural networks with genetic algorithms.         Analytical results generated by the SARIMA model are inputted as the input data of a neural network. Subsequently, the number         of neurons in the hidden layer and the number of learning parameters of the neural network architecture are globally optimized         using genetic algorithms. This model is subsequently adopted to forecast seasonal time series data of the production value         of the mechanical industry in Taiwan.

The         given wavelet neural network can uniformly approximate any continuous function of one variable.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Bo&amp;#382 idar Bratina1 | Nenad Mu&amp;#353 kinja1  | Boris Tovornik1 </authors><title>Design of an auto-associative neural network by using design of experiments approach      </title><content>Advanced monitoring systems enable integration of data-driven algorithms for various tasks, for e.g., control, decision support,         fault detection and isolation (FDI), etc. Due to improvement of monitoring systems, statistical or other computational methods         can be implemented to real industrial systems. Algorithms which rely on process history data sets are promising for real-time         operation especially for online process monitoring tasks, e.g., FDI. However, a reliable FDI system should be robust to uncertainties         and small process deviations, thus, false alarms can be avoided. To achieve this, a good model for comparison between process         and model is needed and for easier FDI implementation, the model has to be derived directly from process history data. In         such cases, model-based FDI approaches are not very practical. In this paper a nonlinear statistical multivariate method (nonlinear         principal component analysis) was used for modeling, and realized with auto-associative artificial neural network (AANN).         A Taguchi design of experiments (DoE) technique was used and compared with a classic approach, where according to the analysis         best AANN model structure was chosen for nonlinear model. Parameters that are important for neural network&amp;#8217;s performance have         been included into a joint orthogonal array to consider interactions between noise and control process variables. Results         are compared to AANN design recommendations by other authors, where obtained nonlinear model was designed for reliable fault         detection of very small faults under closed-loop conditions. By using Taguchi DoE robust design on AANN, an improved and reliable         FDI scheme was achieved even in case of small faults introduced to the system. The accuracy and performance of AANN and FDI         scheme were tested by experiments carried out on a real laboratory hydraulic system, to validate the proposed design for industrial         cases.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Louis Massey1 </authors><title>Discovery of hierarchical thematic structure in text collections with adaptive resonance theory      </title><content>This paper investigates the abilities of adaptive resonance theory (ART) neural networks as miners of hierarchical thematic         structure in text collections. We present experimental results with binary ART1 on the benchmark Reuter-21578 corpus. Using         both quantitative evaluation with the standard F         1 measure and qualitative visualization of the hierarchy obtained with ART, we discuss how useful ART built hierarchies would         be to a user intending to use it as a means to find and access textual information. Our F         1 results show that ART1 produces hierarchical clustering that exhibit a quality exceeding k-means and a hierarchical clustering algorithm. However, we identify several critical problem areas that would make it rather         impractical to actually use such a hierarchy in a real-life environment. These predicaments point to the importance of semantic         feature selection. Our main contribution is to test in details the applicability of ART to the important domain of hierarchical         document clustering, an application of Adaptive Resonance that had received little attention until now.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Weibao Zou1| 2 | Yan Li3 | Arthur Tang4</authors><title>Effects of the number of hidden nodes used in a structured-based neural network on the reliability of image classification      </title><content>A structured-based neural network (NN) with backpropagation through structure (BPTS) algorithm is conducted for image classification         in organizing a large image database, which is a challenging problem under investigation. Many factors can affect the results         of image classification. One of the most important factors is the architecture of a NN, which consists of input layer, hidden         layer and output layer. In this study, only the numbers of nodes in hidden layer (hidden nodes) of a NN are considered. Other         factors are kept unchanged. Two groups of experiments including 2,940 images in each group are used for the analysis. The         assessment of the effects for the first group is carried out with features described by image intensities, and, the second         group uses features described by wavelet coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that the effects of the numbers of         hidden nodes on the reliability of classification are significant and non-linear. When the number of hidden nodes is 17, the         classification rate on training set is up to 95%, and arrives at 90% on the testing set. The results indicate that 17 is an         appropriate choice for the number of hidden nodes for the image classification when a structured-based NN with BPTS algorithm         is applied.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Roy Kwang Yang Chang1 | Chu Kiong Loo2  | M.

In the real world, faulty reading sensors can happen and will create input vectors with         missing features yet they should not be discarded. To overcome this, regularized EM is put in place as a preprocessing step         to impute the missing values. The problem faced by users when using random initialization is that they have to define the         number of clusters through trial and error, which makes it stochastic in nature. Global k-means is used to autonomously find the number of clusters using a selection criterion and deterministically provide the number         of clusters needed to train the model. In addition, fast Global k-means will be tested as an alternative to Global k-means to help reduce computational time. Tests are conducted on both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic PNNs. Benchmark medical         datasets and also vibration data collected from a US Navy CH-46E helicopter aft gearbox known as Westland were used. The tests&amp;#8217;         results fully support the usage of fast Global k-means and regularized EM as preprocessing steps to aid the EM-trained PNN.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Do-Hyeon Kim1 | Kwang-Baek Kim2 | Eui-Young Cha1</authors><title>Fuzzy truck control scheme for obstacle avoidance      </title><content>The fuzzy system can be a good solution when a mathematical model of the system is either unavailable or too complex. Truck         backer-upper control problem is one example of a standard highly nonlinear control problem. Bearing this in mind the control         scheme that considers obstacles near the truck is much more complex than other conventional approaches. In this paper a fuzzy         truck control system for obstacle avoidance, using newly designed 33 fuzzy inference rules for steering control and 13 rules         for speed control, is proposed. Through simulations of various real world situations, we observed that the proposed fuzzy         controller could drive the truck to the goal smoothly while avoiding the obstacles, and showed a reasonably good trajectory.         This flexible and applicable fuzzy control logic can be adapted to provide easy interaction with the driver for state-of-the-art         intelligent cruise control systems.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Ralf Г–stermark1 </authors><title>Geno-mathematical identification of the multi-layer perceptron      </title><content>In this paper, we will focus on the use of the three-layer backpropagation network in vector-valued time series estimation         problems. The neural network provides a framework for noncomplex calculations to solve the estimation problem, yet the search         for optimal or even feasible neural networks for stochastic processes is both time consuming and uncertain. The backpropagation         algorithm&amp;#8212;written in strict ANSI C&amp;#8212;has been implemented as a standalone support library for the genetic hybrid algorithm (GHA)         running on any sequential or parallel main frame computer. In order to cope with ill-conditioned time series problems, we         extended the original backpropagation algorithm to a K nearest neighbors algorithm (K-NARX), where the number K is determined genetically along with a set of key parameters. In the K-NARX algorithm, the terminal solution at instant t can be used as a starting point for the next t, which tends to stabilize the optimization process when dealing with autocorrelated time series vectors. This possibility         has proved to be especially useful in difficult time series problems. Following the prevailing research directions, we use         a genetic algorithm to determine optimal parameterizations for the network, including the lag structure for the nonlinear         vector time series system, the net structure with one or two hidden layers and the corresponding number of nodes, type of         activation function (currently the standard logistic sigmoid, a bipolar transformation, the hyperbolic tangent, an exponential         function and the sine function), the type of minimization algorithm, the number K of nearest neighbors in the K-NARX procedure, the initial value of the Levenberg&amp;#8211;Marquardt damping parameter and the value of the neural learning (stabilization)         coefficient &amp;#945;. We have focused on a flexible structure allowing addition of, e.g., new minimization algorithms and activation         functions in the future.

In addition to this, lack of CM can impose a hindrance in electricity trading.         This paper presents a novel, growing radial basis function neural network (GRBFNN)-based approach for CM. For achieving CM,         Nodal congestion price (NCP) forecasting is performed in real time competitive power market. NCP forecasting is an effective         way of price-based preventive CM as it directly indicates the presence as well as the severity of the congestion in the system.         In present paper, GRBFNN has been developed for NCP forecasting dividing the whole power system into various congestion zones.         An unsupervised learning vector quantization (VQ) clustering algorithm is applied as feature selection technique for the developed         GRBFNN and for partitioning the power system into different congestion zones. For each congestion zone a separate neural network         has been developed to ensure faster training and accurate forecasting results. The proposed approach of CM is implemented         on an RTS 24-bus system. The results obtained are compared with a different constructive algorithm-based RBF network called         as general regression neural network (GRNN) and two back-propagation algorithms based ANNs. Comparison results show that proposed         GRBFNN is more computationally efficient with better predictive ability.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Shiaw-Wu Chen1| Chih-Wei Jen2 | Ann-Chen Chang3 </authors><title>High-resolution DOA estimation based on independent noise component for correlated signal sources      </title><content>In this article, a modified complex-valued FastICA algorithm is utilized to extract the specific feature of the Gaussian noise         component from mixtures so that the estimated component is as independent as possible to the other non-Gaussian signal components.

The fault of high-voltage electric equipment         is difficult to be distinguished as there may be many different reasons. The traditional or simple methods cannot totally         meet the demand of fault diagnosis of high-voltage electric equipment. First, taking neural network as a classifier to distinguish         different fault types from complex fault information in the feature layer can supply a good foundation to final information         fusion diagnosis.

The new hybrid learning algorithm is based on         particle swarm optimization (PSO) for training the antecedent part and gradient descent (GD) for training the conclusion part.         Lyapunov stability theory is used to study the stability of the proposed algorithm. This paper, studies the stability of PSO         as an optimizer in training the identifier, for the first time.

However, knowledge of a distinguishing fault is ambiguous because         definite relationships between symptoms and fault types cannot be easily identified. This paper presents an intelligent diagnosis         method for a centrifugal pump system using features of vibration signals at an early stage. The diagnosis algorithm is derived         using wavelet transform, rough sets and a partially linearized neural network (PNN). ReverseBior wavelet function is used         to extract fault features from measured vibration signals and to capture hidden fault information across optimum frequency         regions. As the input parameters for the neural network, the non-dimensional symptom parameters that can reflect the characteristics         of a signal are defined in the amplitude domain. The diagnosis knowledge for the training of the PNN can be acquired by using         the rough sets. We also propose a diagnosis method based on the PNN, one which can deal with the ambiguity problem of condition         diagnosis, and distinguish fault types on the basis of the possibility distributions of symptom parameters automatically.         The decision method of optimum frequency region for extracting feature signals is also discussed using real plant data. Practical         examples of diagnosis for a centrifugal pump system are shown in order to verify the efficiency of the method.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Michael M.

The RBS inverse problem is to         determine the sample structure information from measured spectra, which can be defined as either a function approximation         or a non-linear optimization problem. Early studies emphasized on numerical methods and empirical fitting. In this work, we         have applied intelligent techniques and compared their performance and effectiveness for spectral data analysis by solving         the inverse problem. Since each RBS spectrum may contain up to 512 data points, principal component analysis is used to make         the feature extraction so as to ease the complexity of constructing the network. The innovative aspects of our work include         introducing dimensionality reduction and noise modeling. Experiments on RBS spectra from SiGe thin films on a silicon substrate         show that the SA is more accurate but the NN is faster, though both methods produce satisfactory results. Both methods are         resilient to 10% Poisson noise in the input. These new findings indicate that in RBS data analysis the NN approach should         be preferred when fast processing is required; whereas the SA method becomes the first choice should the analysis accuracy         be targeted.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>B.

ECG analysis and recognition are both         important and tempting topics in modern medical research. The purpose of this paper is to develop an algorithm which investigates         kernel method, locally linear embedding (LLE), principal component analysis (PCA), and support vector machine(SVM) algorithms         for dimensionality reduction, features extraction, and classification for recognizing and classifying the given ECG signals.

SVM method is applied to classify the ECG         data into several categories of heart diseases. Experimental results obtained demonstrated that the performance of the proposed         method was similar and sometimes better when compared to other ECG recognition techniques, thus indicating a viable and accurate         technique.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Zhixia Yang1| 2| Yingjie Tian3 | Naiyang Deng4 </authors><title>Leave-one-out bounds for support vector ordinal regression machine      </title><content>The success of support vector machine depends upon its parameters.

For this aim, a wind observation station must be constructed and 1-year wind speed and direction data must         be collected. For determining the distribution characteristics, the collected data must be statistically analyzed. The continuity         and reliability of the data are quite important for such studies on the days when possible faults can occur in any part of         the observation unit or on days when, the system is on maintenance, it is not possible to record any data. In this study,         it is assumed that the station had not worked at some randomly chosen days and that for these days no data could be recorded.         The missing data are predicted using the data that were recorded before and after fault or maintenance by an adaptive neuro-fuzzy         inference system (ANFIS). It is seen that ANFIS is successful for such a study.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Tae Hyung Kim1 | Il Kyu Eom2  | Yoo Shin Kim3 </authors><title>Multiscale Bayesian texture segmentation using neural networks and Markov random fields      </title><content>This paper presents a wavelet-based texture segmentation method using multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks and Markov random         fields (MRF) in a multi-scale Bayesian framework. Inputs and outputs of MLP networks are constructed to estimate a posterior         probability. The multi-scale features produced by multi-level wavelet decompositions of textured images are classified at         each scale by maximum a posterior (MAP) classification and the posterior probabilities from MLP networks. An MRF model is         used in order to model the prior distribution of each texture class, and a factor, which fuses the classification information         through scales and acts as a guide for the labeling decision, is incorporated into the MAP classification of each scale. By         fusing the multi-scale MAP classifications sequentially from coarse to fine scales, our proposed method gets the final and         improved segmentation result at the finest scale. In this fusion process, the MRF model serves as the smoothness constraint         and the Gibbs sampler acts as the MAP classifier. Our texture segmentation method was applied to segmentation of gray-level         textured images. The proposed segmentation method shows better performance than texture segmentation using the hidden Markov         trees (HMT) model and the HMTseg algorithm, which is a multi-scale Bayesian image segmentation algorithm.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>JosГ© de JesГєs Rubio1| 2 | Wen Yu3 | AndrГ©s Ferreyra1</authors><title>Neural network training with optimal bounded ellipsoid algorithm      </title><content>Compared to normal learning algorithms, for example backpropagation, the optimal bounded ellipsoid (OBE) algorithm has some         better properties, such as faster convergence, since it has a similar structure as Kalman filter.

Among several SVM variants,         Least-Squares SVMs (LS-SVMs) have gained increased attention recently due mainly to their computationally attractive properties         coming as the direct result of applying a modified formulation that makes use of a sum-squared-error cost function jointly         with equality, instead of inequality, constraints. In this work, we present a flexible hybrid approach aimed at augmenting         the proficiency of LS-SVM classifiers with regard to accuracy/generalization as well as to hyperparameter calibration issues.         Such approach, named as Mixtures of Weighted Least-Squares Support Vector Machine Experts, centers around the fusion of the         weighted variant of LS-SVMs with Mixtures of Experts models. After the formal characterization of the novel learning framework,         simulation results obtained with respect to both binary and multiclass pattern classification problems are reported, ratifying         the suitability of the novel hybrid approach in improving the performance issues considered.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Hanifi Г‡anakc&amp;#305 1| Adil Baykaso&amp;#287 lu2  | Hamza GГјllГј1</authors><title>Prediction of compressive and tensile strength of Gaziantep basalts via neural networks and gene expression programming      </title><content>In this paper, two soft computing approaches, which are known as artificial neural networks and Gene Expression Programming         (GEP) are used in strength prediction of basalts which are collected from Gaziantep region in Turkey.

In this paper, the design of indoor temperature and         relative humidity predictive neural networks in our test house was developed. The test house presented complicated physical         features which are difficult to simulate with physical models.

Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXternal input (NNARX) model and genetic algorithm         were employed to construct networks and were detailed. The comparison between the two methods was also made. Applicability         of some important mathematical validation criteria to practical reality was examined.

This control system is composed of a RCMAC and a compensation controller. RCMAC is used to mimic an ideal controller, and         the compensation controller is designed to compensate for the approximation error between the ideal controller and RCMAC.         The Lyapunov stability theory is utilized to derive the parameter tuning algorithm, so that the uniformly ultimately bound         stability of the closed-loop system can be achieved. For comparison, a fuzzy control, an adaptive fuzzy control and the developed         RCMAC-based adaptive control are implemented on a field programmable gate array chip for controlling a brushless DC motor.         Experimental results reveal that the proposed RCMAC-based adaptive control system can achieve the best tracking performance.         Moreover, since the developed RCMAC-based adaptive control scheme uses a hyperbolic tangent function to compensate for the         approximation error, there is no chattering phenomenon in the control effort. Thus, the proposed control method is more suitable         for real-time practical control applications.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Maria Paula da Costa Couto1 </authors><title>Review of input determination techniques for neural network models based on mutual information and genetic algorithms      </title><content>The use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) models has grown considerably over the last decade. One of the difficulties in         using ANNs is the fact that in most cases there are several numbers of input variables available. In the past, there was a         tendency to use a large number of inputs in ANNs applications. This can have a number of detrimental effects on the network         during training and it also requires a greater amount of data to efficiently estimate the connection weights. Additional inputs         tend to increase the required time for training and the risk of the training algorithm becoming stuck in a local minimum.         A large number of inputs also increases the risk of including spurious variables that merely increase the noise in the forecasts.         Consequently, it is important to use an appropriate selection technique of the input variables in order to obtain the smallest         number of independent inputs that are useful predictors for the system which is being researched. The aim of this paper is         to review techniques that will allow the selection of appropriate model inputs based particularly on mutual information and         genetic algorithms.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Chih-Min Lin1 | Chin-Hsu Leng1| Chun-Fei Hsu2 | Chiu-Hsiung Chen3</authors><title>Robust neural network control system design for linear ultrasonic motor      </title><content>Linear ultrasonic motor (LUSM) has much merit, such as high precision, fast control dynamics and large driving force, etc.;         however, the dynamic characteristic of LUSM is nonlinear and the precise dynamic model of LUSM is difficult to obtain.

The reason is that         sample patches employed as primary patterns of the tile set may not be well stitched if carelessly picked. In this paper,         we introduce a robust approach that can stably generate an &amp;#969;-tile set of high quality and pattern diversity. First, an extendable         rule is introduced to increase the number of sample patches to vary the patterns in an &amp;#969;-tile set. Second, in contrast to         other concurrent techniques that randomly choose sample patches for tile construction, ours uses artificial immune system         (AIS) to select the feasible patches from the input example. This operation ensures the quality of the whole tile set.

The positioning system and positioning theory of ZigBee         which can obtain a rough global localization of the mobile robot are introduced. To realize accurate local positioning, a         laser sensor is used to extract the features from environment, then the environmental features and global reference map can         be matched. From the matched environmental features, the position and orientation of the mobile robot can be obtained. To         enable the mobile robot to avoid obstacle in real-time, a heuristic fuzzy neural network is developed by using heuristic fuzzy         rules and the Kohonen clustering network.

The SNNM is the interconnection of a linear dynamic system and a bounded static nonlinear operator. By combining Lyapunov         functional with S-Procedure, some useful criteria of global asymptotic stability for the discrete-time SNNMs are derived,         whose conditions are formulated as linear matrix inequalities. Most delayed (or non-delayed) RNNs can be transformed into         the SNNMs to be stability analyzed in a unified way. Some application examples of the SNNMs to the stability analysis of the         discrete-time RNNs shows that the SNNMs make the stability conditions of the RNNs easily verified.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Waratt Rattasiri1 | Saman K.

After learning, the proposed method analyzes the entire history of activities and behaviors of all rule nodes, which         reflects their levels of involvement or contribution during the process. The less qualified rule-relevant nodes can then be         identified and removed, reducing the size and complexity of the HNFS. Upon the repetitive learning process, the method may         be repetitively applied until a satisfactory result is obtained, simultaneously improving the performance and reducing the         size and complexity. Incorporated with the method is a new HNFS architecture which addresses both the scalability problem         experienced in rule based systems and the restriction of the &amp;#8220;overcrowded defuzzification&amp;#8221; problem found in hierarchical designs.

The traditional back propagation neural network (BPNN) has slow training speed and is         easy to trap into a local minimum, and it will lead to a poor performance and efficiency. In this paper, we propose the MBPNN         to accelerate the training speed of BPNN and improve the categorization accuracy. LSA can overcome the problems caused by         using statistically derived conceptual indices instead of individual words. It constructs a conceptual vector space in which         each term or document is represented as a vector in the space. It not only greatly reduces the dimension but also discovers         the important associative relationship between terms. We test our categorization model on 20-newsgroup corpus and reuter-21578         corpus, experimental results show that the MBPNN is much faster than the traditional BPNN. It also enhances the performance         of the traditional BPNN. And the application of LSA for our system can lead to dramatic dimensionality reduction while achieving         good classification results.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>IstvГЎn Juhos1 | LГЎszlГі Makra2  | BalГЎzs TГіth1</authors><title>The behaviour of the multi-layer perceptron and the support vector regression learning methods in the prediction of NO and         NO2 concentrations in Szeged, Hungary      </title><content>The main aim of this paper is to predict NO and NO2 concentrations 4;days in advance by comparing two artificial intelligence learning methods, namely, multi-layer perceptron         and support vector machines, on two kinds of spatial embedding of the temporal time series. Hourly values of NO and NO2 concentrations, as well as meteorological variables were recorded in a cross-road monitoring station with heavy traffic in         Szeged, in order to build a model for predicting NO and NO2 concentrations several hours in advance. The prediction of NO and NO2 concentrations was performed partly on the basis of their past values, and partly on the basis of temperature, humidity and         wind speed data. Since NO can be predicted more accurately, its values were considered primarily when forecasting NO2. Time series prediction can be interpreted in a way that is suitable for artificial intelligence learning. Two effective         learning methods, namely, multi-layer perceptron and support vector regression are used to provide efficient non-linear models         for NO and NO2 time series predictions. Multi-layer perceptron is widely used to predict these time series, but support vector regression         has not yet been applied for predicting NO and NO2 concentrations. Three commonly used linear algorithms were considered as references: 1-day persistence, average of several         day persistence and linear regression. Based on the good results of the average of several day persistence, a prediction scheme         was introduced, which forms weighted averages instead of simple ones. The optimization of these weights was performed with         linear regression in linear case and with the learning methods mentioned in non-linear case. Concerning the NO predictions,         the non-linear learning methods give significantly better predictions than the reference linear methods. In the case of NO2, the improvement of the prediction is considerable, however, it is less notable than for NO.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Zhanquan Sun1  | Yinglong Wang1 </authors><title>Traffic congestion identification by combining PCA with higher-order Boltzmann machine      </title><content>Traffic congestion identification is a popular research topic of intelligent transport systems. Identification rate of existing         methods usually cannot meet the practical requirements. To improve the identification rate and reduce the computation cost,         a novel intelligent identification method is proposed. The proposed method combines principal component analysis (PCA) method         with higher-order Boltzmann machine (BM). PCA is used to reduce the dimension of input feature space. It can not only reduce         the computation cost but also filter noise of the source data. BM is a kind of stochastic network that can obtain the global         optimum solution. Higher-order BM without hidden units can save lots of computation cost without decreasing modeling power.         The trained higher-order BM is used to identify traffic state. The efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated through         analyzing Jinan urban transportation data.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Roman M.

In         order to deal with these problems, we propose a cooperative crawler platform based on evolution strategy to build semantic         structure (i.e., local ontologies) of web spaces. Mainly, multiple crawlers can discover semantic instances (i.e., ontology         fragments) from annotated resources in a web space, and a centralized meta-crawler can carry out incremental aggregation of         the semantic instances sent by the multiple crawlers. To do this, we exploit similarity-based ontology matching algorithm         for computing semantic fitness of a population, i.e., summation of all possible semantic similarities between the semantic instances. As a result, we could         efficiently obtain the best mapping condition (i.e., maximizing the semantic fitness) of the estimated semantic structures.         We have shown two significant contributions of this paper; (1) reconciling semantic conflicts between multiple crawlers, and         (2) adapting to evolving semantic structures of web spaces over time.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Georgina Stegmayer1  | Omar Chiotti1| 2</authors><title>Volterra NN-based behavioral model for new wireless communications devices      </title><content>This paper presents a neural network-based behavioral model for accurately reproducing the nonlinear and dynamic behavior         of new wireless communication devices.

Membership function is the         key to introduce the fuzzy sets theory to multiobjective optimization.

On the basis of rapid quadratic optimization in the learning of weights, simplification in hardware         as well as in computational procedures of functional-link net, discrete membership functions are used as sample training data.

Power optimization based on hardware&amp;#8211;software partitioning of a RTOS (RTOS&amp;#8211;Power partitioning) can significantly         minimize the energy consumption of a SoC. This paper presents a new model for RTOS&amp;#8211;Power partitioning, which helps in understanding         the essence of the RTOS&amp;#8211;Power partitioning techniques. A discrete Hopfield neural network approach for implementing the RTOS&amp;#8211;Power         partitioning is proposed, where a novel energy function, operating equation and coefficients of the neural network are redefined.         Simulations are carried out with comparison to other optimization techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed         method can achieve higher energy savings up to 60% at relatively low costs of less than 4k PLBs while increasing the performance         compared to the purely software realized SoC&amp;#8211;RTOS.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Cheng-Chin Chiang1 | Ming-Che Ho1 | Jen-An Chen1</authors><title>A hybrid approach of neural networks and grey modeling for adaptive electricity load forecasting      </title><content>This paper proposes an effective fusion of neural networks and grey modeling for adaptive electricity load forecasting. The         fusion employs the complementary strength of these two appealing techniques. In terms of forecasting accuracy, the proposed         fusion scheme outperforms the individual ones and the statistical autoregressive methods according to the results of a substantial         number of experiments. In addition to the fusion scheme, this paper also proposes a grey relational analysis to automatically         assess the importance of each input variable for the forecasting task. This analysis helps the forecaster choose dominant         ones among the many input variables, thus removing much burden of acquiring professional domain knowledge for problems and         reducing the interference of irrelevant inputs on the forecasting. Experimental results are shown in this paper to verify         the effectiveness of the grey relational analysis.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Ling Ping1| 2  | Zhou Chun-Guang1</authors><title>A new learning schema based on support vector for multi-classification      </title><content>A novel learning schema SVCMR based on support vector is proposed in this paper to address M-class classification issue. It creates a tree-shaped decision frame where M/2 nodes are constructed with the three-separation model as the basic classifier. A class selection rule is defined to ensure         basic classifiers be trained in turn on pair of classes with maximum feature distance. Class contours are extracted as data         representatives to reduce training set size. Another point is that parameters involved in SVCMR are learned from data neighborhood,         which brings adaptation to various datasets and avoids pricy cost spent on searching parameter spaces. Experiments on real         datasets demonstrate the performance of SVCMR can be competitive to those state-of-the-art classifiers but with the higher         effectiveness than them.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>D.

The RBFN is adapted on-line for both model structure and parameters with measurement data. When the RBFN is used to model a non-linear dynamic system, the structure is adapted to model abrupt change of system operating region, while the weights are adapted to model the incipient time varying parameters. Two new algorithms are proposed for adding new centres while the redundant centres are pruned, which is particularly useful for model-based control.

Then, to enhance the performance of the obtained EFBFN         ulteriorly, a novel evolutionary algorithm based on LS and the hybrid of evolutionary programming and particle swarm optimization         (LS-EPPSO) is proposed, in which we use EPPSO to tune the parameters of the premise part in EFBFN, and the LS algorithm to         decide the consequent parameters in it simultaneously. The enhanced EFBFN whose parameters are refined automatically using         LS-EPPSO is thus called adaptive EFBFN. In the simulation part, the proposed method to construct AEFBFN is employed to model         a three input nonlinear function and to predict a chaotic time series.

This adaptive RCMAC sliding-model control (ARCSMC) system is composed of two systems. One         is an adaptive RCMAC system utilized as the main controller, in which an RCMAC is designed to identify the system models.         Another is a robust controller utilized to achieve system&amp;#8217;s robust characteristics, in which an uncertainty bound estimator         is developed to estimate the uncertainty bound so that the chattering phenomenon of control effort can be eliminated. The         on-line adaptive laws of the ARCSMC system are derived in the sense of Lyapunov so that the system stability can be guaranteed.         Finally, a comparison between SMC and ARCSMC for a chaotic system and a car-following system are presented to illustrate the         effectiveness of the proposed ARCSMC system. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme can achieve favorable         control performances for the chaotic system and car-following systems without the knowledge of system dynamic functions.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Dongwon Kim1  | Gwi-Tae Park1 </authors><title>Advanced self-organizing polynomial neural network      </title><content>In this paper, we introduce a concept of advanced self-organizing polynomial neural network (Adv_SOPNN). The SOPNN is a flexible         neural architecture whose structure is developed through a modeling process. But the SOPNN has a fatal drawback; it cannot         be constructed for nonlinear systems with few input variables. To relax this limitation of the conventional SOPNN, we combine         a fuzzy system and neural networks with the SOPNN. Input variables are partitioned into several subspaces by the fuzzy system         or neural network, and these subspaces are utilized as new input variables to the SOPNN architecture. Two types of the advanced         SOPNN are obtained by combining not only the fuzzy rules of a fuzzy system with SOPNN but also the nodes in a hidden layer         of neural networks with SOPNN into one methodology. The proposed method is applied to the nonlinear system with two inputs,         which cannot be identified by conventional SOPNN to show the performance of the advanced SOPNN. The results show that the         proposed method is efficient for systems with limited data set and a few input variables and much more accurate than other         modeling methods with respect to identification error.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Aristoklis D.

Some drugs and most of their cell targets are proteins,         because proteins dictate biological phenotype. In this context, the automated analysis of protein localisation is more complex         than the automated analysis of DNA sequences; nevertheless the benefits to be derived are of same or greater importance. In         order to accomplish this target, the right choice of the kind of the methods for these applications, especially when the data         set is drastically imbalanced, is very important and crucial. In this paper we investigate the performance of some commonly         used classifiers, such as the K nearest neighbours and feed-forward neural networks with and without cross-validation, in a class of imbalanced problems         from the bioinformatics domain. Furthermore, we construct ensemble-based schemes using the notion of diversity, and we empirically         test their performance on the same problems. The experimental results favour the generation of neural network ensembles as         these are able to produce good generalisation ability and significant improvement compared to other single classifier methods.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>K.

Identification experiments have been carried out in two buildings and different models, such as linear ARX-, ARMAX- and BJ-models as well as non-linear artificial neural network models (ANN-models) of different orders, have been identified based on these experiments. In the models, many different input signals have been used, such as the outdoor and indoor temperature, heating power, wall temperatures, ventilation flow rate, time of day and sun radiation. For both buildings, it is shown that ANN-models give more accurate temperature predictions than linear models. For the first building, it is shown that a non-linear combination of sun radiation and time of day is important when predicting the indoor temperature. For the second building, it is shown that the indoor temperature is non-linearly dependent on the ventilation flow rate.</content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Muriel Perez1 </authors><title>Artificial neural networks and bankruptcy forecasting: a state of the art      </title><content>The use of neural networks in finance began by the end of the 1980s and by the beginning of the 1990s, it developed specific         applications related to forecasting on the failure of companies.

The intrinsic and latent dangers of neural nets (within a control framework) are often overlooked when assessing a suitable technology for real-time control application. This case study examines the intrinsic properties of a neural net that make it wholly unsuitable as a technology directly or indirectly involved in the manipulation of process valves. Of particular concern is the optimization of product grade transitions. Apart from start up and shutdown, product grade transitions are the most safety critical procedures performed on a manufacturing plant. Any control system involved in the automation of such procedures should be of the highest integrity and adhere to sound, intrinsically safe control engineering principles&amp;#8212;something neural networks categorically fail to provide. The objectives of this case study are twofold. Firstly, the aim is to raise awareness in the manufacturing industry of the inherent and latent dangers of neural networks in control. The second objective is to provide a platform for best practice guidance on what is and is not acceptable as a modeling paradigm in a manufacturing process control scheme.</content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Janet Rothwell1| Zuhair B|ar1 | James O&amp;#8217 Shea1 | David McLean1</authors><title>Charting the behavioural state of a person using a backpropagation neural network      </title><content>This paper describes the application of a backpropagation artificial neural network (ANN) for charting the behavioural state         of previously unseen persons. In a simulated theft scenario participants stole or did not steal some money and were interviewed         about the location of the money. A video of each interview was presented to an automatic system, which collected vectors containing         nonverbal behaviour data.

Object similarity, or more often         object dissimilarity, is usually expressed in terms of some distance function. This approach, however, is not viable when         dissimilarity is conceptual rather than metric. In this paper, we propose to extract the dissimilarity relation directly from         the available data. To this aim, we train a feedforward neural network with some pairs of points with known dissimilarity.         Then, we use the dissimilarity measure generated by the network to guide a new unsupervised fuzzy relational clustering algorithm.         An artificial data set and a real data set are used to show how the clustering algorithm based on the neural dissimilarity         outperforms some widely used (possibly partially supervised) clustering algorithms based on spatial dissimilarity.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Long Cheng1 | Zeng-Guang Hou1  | Min Tan1 </authors><title>Constrained multi-variable generalized predictive control using a dual neural network      </title><content>Multi-variable generalized predictive control algorithm has obtained great success in process industries. However, it suffers         from a high computational cost because the multi-stage optimization approach in the algorithm is time-consuming when constraints         of the control system are considered. In this paper, a dual neural network is employed to deal with the multi-stage optimization         problem, and bounded constraints on the input and output signals of the control system are taken into account. The dual neural         network has many favorable features such as simple structure, rapid execution, and easy implementation. Therefore, the computation         efficiency, in comparison with the consecutive executions of numerical algorithms on digital computers, is increased dramatically.         In addition, the dual network model can yield the exact optimum values of future control signals while many other neural networks         only obtain the approximate optimal solutions. Hence the multi-variable generalized predictive control algorithm based on         the dual neural network is suitable for industrial applications with the real-time computation requirement. Simulation examples         are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Ch|imal Jayawardena1 | Keigo Watanabe1 | Kiyotaka Izumi1</authors><title>Controlling a robot manipulator with fuzzy voice commands using a probabilistic neural network      </title><content>Natural language commands are generated by intelligent human beings.

However, many of these approaches provide inadequate forms of safety assurance required for certification. As a result, neural networks are typically restricted to advisory roles in safety-related applications. Neural networks have the ability to operate in unpredictable and changing environments. It is therefore desirable to certify them for highly-dependable roles in safety critical systems. This paper outlines the safety criteria which are safety requirements for the behaviour of neural networks. If enforced, the criteria can contribute to justifying the safety of ANN functional properties. Characteristics of potential neural network models are also outlined and are based upon representing knowledge in interpretable and understandable forms. The paper also presents a safety lifecycle for artificial neural networks. This lifecycle focuses on managing behaviour represented by neural networks and contributes to providing acceptable forms of safety assurance.</content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Adesh K.

Also, a conventional multiple linear regression (MLR) model is developed for the prediction.         In this study, all the models have been developed using a scientifically determined optimum dataset of representative breeding         traits of the cattle. The prediction performances of the connectionist models are compared with that of the conventional model.         This study shows that the RBFNN model performs relatively better than the MLR model. However, the BPNN model performs more         or less in the close vicinity of the conventional MLR model. Hence, it is inferred that the connectionist models have potential         as an alternative to the conventional models for predicting FLMY305 in KF cattle.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Antanas Verikas1| 2 | Marija Bacauskiene2  | Carl-Magnus Nilsson1 </authors><title>Estimating the amount of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks in arbitrary colour pictures      </title><content>This paper is concerned with the offset lithographic colour printing. To obtain high quality colour prints, given proportions         of cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (K) inks (four primary inks used in the printing process) should be accurately         maintained in any area of the printed picture. To accomplish the task, the press operator needs to measure the printed result         for assessing the proportions and use the measurement results to reduce the colour deviations. Specially designed colour bars         are usually printed to enable the measurements.

The validation of the         methodology is carried out following a series of experiments performed over a wide range of cutting conditions in which the         effect of various process parameters, such as drill diameter, feed-rate, spindle speed, etc. on drill wear has been considered.         Subsequently, the data, divided suitably into training and testing samples, have been used to effectively train both the backpropagation         and radial basis function neural networks, and the individual performance of the two networks is then analyzed. It is observed         that the performance of the RBFN fails to match that of the BPNN when the network complexity and the amount of data available         are the constraining factors. However, when a simpler training procedure and reduced computational times are required, then         RBFN is the preferred choice.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Ali Gholipour1| 2 | Caro Lucas1| 2 | Babak N.

The principal components (PCs) obtained from spectral analysis have narrow band         frequency spectra and definite linear or nonlinear trends and periodic patterns; hence they are predictable in large prediction         horizon. The incremental learning algorithm initiates a model for each of the components as an optimal linear least squares         estimation, and adds the nonlinear neurons if they help to reduce error indices over training and validation sets. Therefore,         the algorithm automatically constructs the best linear or nonlinear model for each of the PCs to achieve maximum generalization,         and the long-term prediction of the original time series is obtained by recombining the predicted components. The proposed         method has been primarily tested in long-term prediction of some well-known nonlinear time series obtained from Mackey&amp;#8211;Glass,         Lorenz, and Ikeda map chaotic systems, and the results have been compared to the predictions made by multi-layered perceptron         (MLP) and radial basis functions (RBF) networks. As a real world case study, the method has been applied to the long-term         prediction of solar activity where the results have been compared to the long-term predictions of physical precursor and solar         dynamo methods.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>T.

Minutiae are the terminations and bifurcations of ridges in a fingerprint image. Generally fingerprint images are of low quality due to the presence of noise and contrast deficiency resulting in discontinuity in ridges producing false minutiae points. It is worth noting that there is a fundamental difference between a neural network (NN) approach for minutiae location and minutiae filtering. In this paper, the spurious minutiae points and the bug pixels introduced during the thinning process are eliminated based on the neighborhood pixel information. A new minutiae filtering algorithm using a NN is introduced to improve the accuracy of the extraction algorithm proposed in the literature. Each minutia, as detected by the algorithm, is classified through ARTMAP NN whose output indicates whether it is a termination, a bifurcation or a false minutia. Experimental results show that the efficiency of minutiae classification has significantly improved using the proposed filtering algorithm.</content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Bernhard Sick1  | Seppo J.

Soft computing         is known as a complementary set of techniques such as neural networks, fuzzy systems, or evolutionary computation which are         able to deal with uncertainty, partial truth, and imprecision. Hard computing, i.e., the huge set of traditional techniques,         is usually seen as the antipode of soft computing. Fusion of soft and hard computing techniques aims at exploiting the particular         advantages of both realms. This article introduces a multi-dimensional categorization scheme for fusion techniques and applies         it by analyzing several fusion techniques where the soft computing part is realized by a neural network. The categorization         scheme facilitates the discussion of advantages or drawbacks of certain fusion approaches, thus supporting the development         of novel fusion techniques and applications.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Byoung-Jun Park1| Witold Pedrycz1| 2  | Sung-Kwun Oh3</authors><title>Fuzzy polynomial neurons as neurofuzzy processing units      </title><content>In this study, we introduce and study fuzzy polynomial neurons (FPNs) being regarded as generic processing units in neurofuzzy         computing.

This optimization process consists of a combination of mesh reduction and mesh smoothing that will not only improve the speed         for the computation of a 3D graphical or finite element model, but also improve the quality of its mesh. The GA is developed         and implemented to replace the original mesh with a re-triangulation process. The GA features optimized initial population,         constrained crossover operator, constrained mutation operator and multi-objective fitness evaluation function. While retaining         features is important to both visualization models and finite element models, this algorithm also optimizes the shape of the         triangular elements, improves the smoothness of the mesh and performs mesh reduction based on the needs of the user.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Hongyi Peng1  | Siming Zhu1</authors><title>Handling of incomplete data sets using ICA and SOM in data mining      </title><content>Based on independent component analysis (ICA) and self-organizing maps (SOM), this paper proposes an ISOM-DH model for the         incomplete data&amp;#8217;s handling in data mining.

The fast growing cellular mobile systems         demand more efficient and faster channel allocation techniques today. In case of patterned traffic load, the traditional BCA         methods are not efficient to further enhance the performance because heavy-traffic cells cannot borrow channels from their         neighboring cells with light or medium traffic that may have unused nominal channels. The performance can be increased if         the short-term traffic load can be predicted. The predicted results can then be used for channel re-assignment. Therefore,         the unused nominal channels of the light-or-medium-traffic cells can be transferred to the heavy-traffic cells that need more         nominal channels. In this paper, CPSOM is used online for traffic prediction. In this sense, the proposed CPSOM-based BCA         method is able to enhance the performance for patterned traffic load compared with the traditional BCA methods. Simulation         results corroborate that the proposed method enables the system to work with better performance for patterned traffic load         than the traditional BCA methods.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>D.

The MNNT is a powerful tool to work with neural networks.         However, MNNT has not been conceived as a reusable and integrable software piece, and its results are clearly inadequate to         be used for development of applications. The component library presented in this paper is fully reusable, allowing the integration         of the neural networks toolbox objects and functions in software applications, independently of the platform and tools used         to build it. Furthermore, this library provides two different sets of classes to the programmers, one of them presenting an         application program interface (API) similar to the Matlab toolbox, and the other a fully object-oriented designed API, which         is easier to use and more adequate for object-oriented and rapid application development. This library combines the advantages         of being fully reusable and internally employing the MNNT to perform the algorithmic task, consequently inheriting all its         power, robustness and comprehensiveness, but without its reusability limitations.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Mal Rey Lee1  | Eung-Kwan Kang2</authors><title>Learning enabled cooperative agent behavior in an evolutionary and competitive environment      </title><content>The proposed method is implemented in three steps: first, when a variation in environment is perceived, agents take appropriate         actions.

In this paper, two different reward models, reward model 1 and         reward model 2, are applied. Each reward model is designed to consider the reinforcement or constraint of behaviors. In competitive         agent environments, the behavior considered to be advantageous is reinforced as adding reward values.

This odor-detecting system is called olfactory bulb and is located in the limbic region of the brain. Its         functionality is based on neurons, primarily mitral and granule cells, and communication among them. This process is very         complex and involves different types of neurotransmitters. The basic function of neurotransmitters is the realization of communication         processes between neurons. Additionally, they are responsible for the efficient and accurate processing of the information,         as well as for the generation of cellular changes, which corresponds to the memory functionality. In our work, we simulate         the main types of chemicals of the olfactory bulb using spiking neuron model: gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxi-5-methylisoxasole-propionionate (AMPA). In this relatively unexplored area of         research (from computing prospective), we design an architecture and experimentally analyze simulation results referring to         available biological research and established biophysiological data. We provide the description of different neurotransmitters         and their dynamics. The main focus of our work is to analyze the neurotransmitter effects based on the computational simulations         corresponding to the biological environment in the olfactory bulb. The results of our work agree with the biological description         of the simulated neurotransmitters as well as with experimental results in the biophysiological area.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Richard Labib1  | Reza Assadi1</authors><title>Modified multi-layered perceptron applied to packing and covering problems      </title><content>Prior knowledge of the input&amp;#8211;output problems often leads to supervised learning restrictions that can hamper the multi-layered         perceptron&amp;#8217;s (MLP) capacity to find an optimal solution.

In this paper, we propose         a predictive rate control system for data transmission, which is designed to improve the number of valid transmitted packets         for the transmission of real-time multimedia over the Internet. The one-step-ahead round-trip delay time and packet loss are         predicted using a prediction algorithm and then these predicted values are used to determine the transmission rate. A real-time         multimedia transmission system was implemented using a TCP-friendly algorithm, in order to obtain the measurement data needed         for the proposed system. Neural network modeling was performed using the collected data, which consisted of the round-trip         time (RTT) delay and packet loss rate (PLR). In addition, the performance of the neural network prediction model was verified         through a validation process. The transmission rate was determined from the values of RTT delay and PLR, and a data transmission         test for an actual system was performed using this transmission rate. The experiment results show that the algorithm proposed         in this study increases the number of valid packets compared with the TCP-friendly algorithm.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>N| Kishor1  | S.

Applications performance significantly depends on the structure and behaviors of the underlying self-organizing         overlay networks. To achieve desired performance, not only the logical overlay topology but also the behaviors of nodes in         this overlay network need to be optimized. Moreover, self-organizing overlay networks are extremely dynamic, unreliable and         often large-scale. It is therefore important to design new optimizing approaches to meet these challenges. In this paper,         we present an evolutionary optimization methodology for self-organizing overlay network. The optimizations of self-organizing         overlay networks are modeled as dynamically evolutionary process, in which the nodes interact with each other, change their         internal structures and alter their external links to improve the collective performance. To design appropriate fitness functions         and rules that guides the direction of the evolution, overlay network can reach a stable state with desired global application         performance eventually. Such a methodology leads to our distributed algorithms for proximity-based overlay topology maintenance         and Peer-to-Peer living media streaming, in which every node in the overlay network rewires their behaviors and connectivity         according to local available information and embedded rules. These algorithms are shown to perform well using simulations.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Yong Shi1 | Xinyang Zhang1| Jia Wan2| Yong Wang3| Wei Yin1| Zhiwei Cao4 | Yajun Guo5</authors><title>Predicting the distance between antibody&amp;#8217;s interface residue and antigen to recognize antigen types by support vector machine      </title><content>In this paper, a machine learning approach, known as support vector machine (SVM) is employed to predict the distance between         antibody&amp;#8217;s interface residue and antigen in antigen&amp;#8211;antibody complex.

However, there is a lack of study that encompasses         the scope for predicting the chenille yarn abrasion resistance with artificial neural network (ANN) models. This paper presents         an intelligent modeling methodology based on ANNs for predicting the abrasion resistance of chenille yarns and fabrics.

In a first phase,         a number of impact cases are randomly generated, varying the values of the parameters which define the impact problem (radius,         length and velocity of the projectile; thickness of the protection). After simulation of each case using a finite element         code, the above-mentioned parameters and the results of the simulation (residual velocity and residual mass of the projectile)         are used as input and output data to train and validate a neural network. In addition, the number of training cases needed         to arrive at a given predictive error is studied. The results are satisfactory, this alternative providing a highly recommended         option for armour design tasks, due to its simplicity of handling, low computational cost and efficiency.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Xun Liang1| 2 </authors><title>Removal of hidden neurons in multilayer perceptrons by orthogonal projection and weight crosswise propagation</title><content>A new method of pruning away hidden neurons in neural networks is presented in this paper. The hidden neuron is removed by analyzing the orthogonal projection correlations among the outputs of other hidden neurons. The method guarantees the least loss of weight information in terms of orthogonal projection. The remaining weights and thresholds are updated based on the weight crosswise propagation. A practical technique for penalizing the superfluous hidden neurons is explored. Retraining is needed after pruning. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results demonstrate that the method gives better initial points for retraining and retraining costs less epochs.</content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Trevor C.

Our focus is the Bayesian framework for developing a model-averaged probabilistic classifier implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and where appropriate its reversible jump variant (RJ-MCMC). Within this context we suggest a new technique, building on the reject region idea, to identify areas in feature space that are associated with &amp;#8220;unsure&amp;#8221; classification predictions. We term such areas &amp;#8220;uncertainty envelopes&amp;#8221; and they are defined in terms of the full characteristics of the posterior predictive density in different regions of the feature space. We argue this is more informative than use of a traditional reject region which considers only point estimates of predictive probabilities. Results from the method we propose are illustrated on synthetic data and also usefully applied to real life safety critical systems involving medical trauma data.</content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>A.

Apart from wisdom and tacit knowledge, experience and awareness of the physical laws governing the universe are themselves the ingredients of success in a particular undertaking. However, unfamiliar circumstances pose a challenge to the extrapolation of the past experience to the future expectations. This is particularly true within the context of new discoveries or novel application of emerging and complex/adaptive technologies. Amongst many facets of performance pertaining to a product, process or undertaking, safety is generally a more demanding aspect to forecast, manage and deliver. The statutory framework poses further constraints on performance where the potential for harm to people or the environment arises from a product or system. The modernisation programme for the West Coast Main Line (WCML) railways in the UK involves adoption and implementation of a few advanced technologies to assist with better train protection and network utilisation. The extent, scope and inter-related nature of these advanced technologies within WCML modernisation programme necessitate a systematic framework commensurate with the scale of the problem and undertakings. To this end, an advanced risk forecasting model was devised at Railtrack to support the safety assessment and assurance of the programme within its three key evolutionary phases.</content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Ning Li1  | Huaxiang Lu1</authors><title>Single-electron tunneling depressing synapse for cellular neural networks      </title><content>In this paper, a cellular neural network with depressing synapses for contrast-invariant pattern classification and synchrony         detection is presented, starting from the impulse model of the single-electron tunneling junction.

It is proved that the most significant parameter in this process is the curvature, especially when rapid changes         of curvature on a free form surface occurred. As the Gaussian distribution of surface curvatures and slope gradient data were         presumed, the mean and variance was used for one-dimensional data presentation, and the Hebbian output data vector was used         to assess probability, density function and distribution of the presented data.

The feedforward computational time of a multilayer feedforward network can be reduced by using these functions as the activation functions. Three modifications of training algorithms are proposed. First, we use the modified error function so that the sigmoid prime factor for the updating rule of the output units is eliminated. Second, we normalize the input patterns in order to balance the dynamic range of the inputs. And third, we add a new penalty function to the hidden layer to get the anti-Hebbian rules in providing information when the activation functions have zero sigmoid prime factor. The three modifications are combined with two versions of Rprop (Resilient propagation) algorithm. The proposed procedures achieved excellent results without the need for careful selection of the training parameters. Not only the algorithm but also the shape of the activation function has important influence on the training performance.</content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Zhai Zhang1 | Youren Wang1| Shanshan Yang1| Rui Yao1 | Jiang Cui1</authors><title>The research of self-repairing digital circuit based on embryonic cellular array      </title><content>The properties of self-testing and self-repairing on chip are the ultimate objectives of digital circuit design.

Wavelet networks are as neural network         for training and structural approach. But, training algorithms of wavelet networks is required a smaller number of iterations         when the compared with neural networks. Gaussian-based mother wavelet function is used as an activation function. Wavelet         networks have three main parameters; dilation, translation, and connection parameters (weights). Initial values of these parameters         are randomly selected. They are optimized during training (learning) phase. Because of random selection of all initial values,         it may not be suitable for process modeling. Because wavelet functions are rapidly vanishing functions. For this reason heuristic         procedure has been used. In this study serial-parallel identification model has been applied to system modeling. This structure         does not utilize feedback. Real system outputs have been exercised for prediction of the future system outputs. So that stability         and approximation of the network is guaranteed. Gradient methods have been applied for parameters updating with momentum term.         Quadratic cost function is used for error minimization.

The human decision process is driven by rational reasoning, which is the capacity         to use the faculty of reason to facilitate logical thinking and to derive uncertain but sensible arguments from existing knowledge         and the observed fact. Knowledge refers to the accumulation and the continuous neurological organization of information via         the repeated exposure to its effective usage. Functionally, a decision support system seeks to provide a systematic and human-like         way to data analysis by synthesizing an expert&amp;#8217;s knowledge and reasoning capability to support the decision process of the         user. However, conventional knowledge engineering and decision support systems often performed poorly when they are applied         to problem domains festered with uncertain information, where the quality of the observed data is compromised by measurement         noises. This paper presents T2-GenSoFNN, a brain-inspired fuzzy semantic memory model embedded with Type-2 fuzzy logic inference         for learning and reasoning with noise-corrupted data.

One positive example to thousands of         negative instances is common in scientific applications. Unfortunately, traditional machine learning techniques often treat         rare instances as noise. One popular approach for this difficulty is to resample the training data. However, this results         in high false positive predictions. Hence, we propose preprocessing training data by partitioning them into clusters. This         greatly reduces the imbalance between minority and majority instances in each cluster. For moderate imbalance ratio, our technique         gives better prediction accuracy than other resampling method. For extreme imbalance ratio, this technique serves as a good         filter that reduces the amount of imbalance so that traditional classification techniques can be deployed. More importantly,         we have successfully applied our techniques to splice site prediction and protein subcellular localization problem, with significant         improvements over previous predictors.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Mounir Ben Nasr1  | Mohamed Chtourou1 </authors><title>A fuzzy neighborhood-based training algorithm for feedforward neural networks      </title><content>In this work we present a new hybrid algorithm for feedforward neural networks, which combines unsupervised and supervised         learning.

Generally, detectors in the original NSA are first generated in a random manner.         However, those detectors matching the self samples are eliminated thereafter. The remaining detectors can therefore be employed         to detect any anomaly. Unfortunately, conventional NSA detectors are not adaptive for dealing with time-varying circumstances.

The algorithm         involves chaotic neurodynamics. To realize effective packet routing, we first composed a basic method by a neural network,         which routes packets with shortest path information between two nodes in the computer network. When the computer network has         an irregular topology, the basic routing method does not work well, because most of packets cannot be transmitted to their         destinations due to packet congestion in the computer network. To avoid such an undesirable problem, we employed chaotic neurodynamics         to extend the basic method. Numerical experiments show that our proposed method exhibits good performance for scale-free networks.         We also analyze why the proposed routing method is effective, comparing the proposed method with several stochastic methods.         We introduced the method of surrogate data, a statistical hypothesis testing which is often used in the field of nonlinear         time-series analysis. Analysis of the proposed method by the method of surrogate data reveals that the chaotic neurodynamics         is most effective to decentralize the packet congestion in the computer network.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Fei Han1| 2  | De-Shuang Huang2 </authors><title>A new constrained learning algorithm for function approximation by encoding a priori information into feedforward neural networks      </title><content>In this paper, a new learning algorithm which encodes a priori information into feedforward neural networks is proposed for function approximation problem.

The developed ARNNC system is composed of a neural controller and a robust controller. The neural         controller which uses a self-structuring recurrent neural network (SRNN) is the principal controller, and the robust controller         is designed to achieve L         2 tracking performance with desired attenuation level. The SRNN approximator is used to online estimate an ideal tracking controller         with the online structuring and parameter learning algorithms. The structure learning possesses the ability of both adding         and pruning hidden neurons, and the parameter learning adjusts the interconnection weights of neural network to achieve favorable         approximation performance. And, by the L         2 control design technique, the worst effect of approximation error on the tracking error can be attenuated to be less or equal         to a specified level. Finally, the proposed ARNNC system with structure adaptation algorithm is applied to control two nonlinear         dynamic systems. Simulation results prove that the proposed ARNNC system with structure adaptation algorithm can achieve favorable         tracking performance even unknown the control system dynamics function.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Yamina Mohamed Ben Ali1 </authors><title>Advances in evolutionary feature selection neural networks with co-evolution learning      </title><content>Training neural networks is a complex task provided that many algorithms are combined to find best solutions to the classification         problem. In this work, we point out the evolutionary computing to minimize a neural configuration. For this purpose, a distribution         estimation framework is performed to select relevant features, which lead to classification accuracy with a lower complexity         in computational time. Primarily, a pruning strategy-based score function is applied to decide the network relevance in the         genetic population. Since the complexity of the network (connections, weights, and biases) is most important, the cooling         state of the system will strongly relate to the entropy as a minimization function to reach the desired solution. Also, the         framework proposes coevolution learning (with discrete and continuous representations) to improve the behavior of the evolutionary         neural learning. The results obtained after simulations show that the proposed work is a promising way to extend its usability         to other classes of neural networks.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Krzysztof Socha1  | Christian Blum2 </authors><title>An ant colony optimization algorithm for continuous optimization: application to feed-forward neural network training      </title><content>Ant colony optimization (ACO) is an optimization technique that was inspired by the foraging behaviour of real ant colonies.         Originally, the method was introduced for the application to discrete optimization problems. Recently we proposed a first         ACO variant for continuous optimization. In this work we choose the training of feed-forward neural networks for pattern classification         as a test case for this algorithm. In addition, we propose hybrid algorithm variants that incorporate short runs of classical         gradient techniques such as backpropagation. For evaluating our algorithms we apply them to classification problems from the         medical field, and compare the results to some basic algorithms from the literature. The results show, first, that the best         of our algorithms are comparable to gradient-based algorithms for neural network training, and second, that our algorithms         compare favorably with a basic genetic algorithm.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Xun Liang1| 2 | Rong-Chang Chen3  | Jian Yang4</authors><title>An architecture-adaptive neural network online control system      </title><content>An architecture-adaptive intelligent self-tuning control system is presented.

The essence of 2DPCA is that it computes the eigenvectors of the so-called image covariance matrix without         matrix-to-vector conversion. Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is a non-linear generation of the popular principal         component analysis via the Kernel trick. Similarly, the Kernelization of 2DPCA can be benefit to develop the non-linear structures         in the input data. However, the standard K2DPCA always suffers from the computational problem for using the image matrix directly.         In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to speed up the training procedure of K2DPCA. The results of experiments         on face recognition show that the proposed algorithm can achieve much more computational efficiency and remarkably save the         memory-consuming compared to the standard K2DPCA.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Luping Ji1 | Zhang Yi1 | Lifeng Shang1</authors><title>An improved pulse coupled neural network for image processing      </title><content>To develop new image processing applications for pulse coupled neural network (PCNN), this paper proposes an improved PCNN         model by redesigning the linking input, activity strength, linking weight, pulse threshold and pixel update rule.

This navigator can be optimized for any user-defined         objective function through the use of an evolutionary algorithm. The motivation of this research is to develop an efficient         methodology for general goal-directed navigation in generic indoor environments as opposed to learning specialized primitive         behaviors in a limited environment. To this end, a modular NN has been employed to achieve the necessary generalization capability         across a variety of indoor environments. Herein, each NN module takes charge of navigating in a specialized local environment,         which is the result of decomposing the whole path into a sequence of local paths through clustering of all the possible environments.         We verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithm over a variety of both simulated and real unstructured indoor environments         using our autonomous mobile robot platform.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Weimin Li1 | Yishu Luo1| Qin Zhu1| Jianwei Liu1 | Jiajin Le1</authors><title>Applications of AR*-GRNN model for financial time series forecasting      </title><content>AR* models contain Autoregressive Moving Average and Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic class model which         are widely used in time series.

Although currently most researches involving time series forecasting use the traditional methods, particle filters can be         applied to any state-space model and generalize the traditional Kalman filter methods, providing better results. Furthermore,         it is well-known that for classification and regression tasks ensembles achieve better performances than the algorithms that         compose them. Therefore, it is expected that ensembles of time series predictors can provide even better results than particle         filters. The regression error characteristic (REC) analysis is a powerful technique for visualization and comparison of regression         models. The objective of this work is to advocate the use of REC curves in order to compare traditional Kalman filter methods         with particle filters and analyze their use in ensembles, which can achieve a better performance.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>K.

This has primarily been a consequence of their good predictive performance and inherent analytical properties.         Gaussian processes are a member of the family of non-parametric Bayesian regression models and can be derived from the perspective         of neural networks. Their behaviour is controlled through the structure of the covariance function. However, when applied         to batch processes, whose data exhibits different variance structures throughout the duration of the batch, a single Gaussian         process may not be appropriate for the accurate modelling of its behaviour. Furthermore there are issues with respect to the         computational costs of Gaussian processes. The implementation of a Gaussian process model requires the repeated computation         of a matrix inverse whose order is the cubic of the number of training data points. This renders the algorithm impractical         when dealing with large data sets. To address these two issues, a mixture model of Gaussian processes is proposed. The resulting         prediction is attained as a weighted sum of the outputs from each Gaussian process component, with the weights determined         by a Gaussian kernel gating network. The model is implemented through a Bayesian approach utilising Markov chain Monte Carlo         algorithms. The proposed methodology is applied to data from a bench-mark batch simulation polymerization process, methyl         methacrylate (MMA), and the results are compared with those from a single Gaussian process to illustrate the advantages of         the proposed mixture model approach.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Zhihua Xiong1 | Yixin Xu1 | Jie Zhang2  | Jin Dong3 </authors><title>Batch-to-batch control of fed-batch processes using control-affine feedforward neural network      </title><content>A control strategy for fed-batch processes is proposed based on control affine feed-forward neural network (CAFNN). Many fed-batch         processes can be considered as a class of control affine nonlinear systems. CAFNN is constructed by a special structure to         fit the control affine system. It is similar to a multi-layer feed-forward neural network, but it has its own particular feature         to model the fed-batch process. CAFNN can be trained by a modified Levenberg&amp;#8211;Marquardt (LM) algorithm. However, due to model-plant         mismatches and unknown disturbances, the optimal control policy calculated based on the CAFNN model may not be optimal when         applied to the fed-batch process. In terms of the repetitive nature of fed-batch processes, iterative learning control (ILC)         can be used to improve the process performance from batch to batch. Due to the special structure of CAFNN, the gradient information         of CAFNN can be computed analytically and applied to the batch-to-batch ILC. Under the ILC strategy from batch to batch, endpoint         product qualities of fed-batch processes can be improved gradually. The proposed control scheme is illustrated on a simulated         fed-batch ethanol fermentation process.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>S. G. Li1  | Z. M.

Therefore, the main aim of         this paper is to design an enhanced fuzzy neural network (EFNN)-based predictor to forecast the business performance of CVS.         Without considering relevant domain knowledge, traditional fuzzy neural networks suffer from the problem of low accuracy of         forecasting unseen examples. Moreover, traditional fuzzy neural networks have to turn weights with a kind of time-consuming         gradient steepest descent training algorithm. Considering the relationship between the evaluation factors globally, we devise         the EFNN which assigns connection weights based on the expert domain knowledge without painstakingly and repeatedly turning         them. Furthermore, by generating and refining the activation function based on genetic algorithm, our EFNN can provide comprehensive         and accurate activation functions and fit a wider range of nonlinear models. By experimenting our methods with several benchmark         methods, the proposed methods are found to have an optimal accuracy in forecasting the business performance of CVS with a         permanent good performance.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Shaoning Pang1 | Ilkka Havukkala1 | Yingjie Hu1  | Nikola Kasabov1 </authors><title>Classification consistency analysis for bootstrapping gene selection      </title><content>Consistency modelling for gene selection is a new topic emerging from recent cancer bioinformatics research.

This paper presents an automatic neural-network-based road sign recognition         system. First, a study of the existing road sign recognition research is presented. In this study, the issues associated with         automatic road sign recognition are described, the existing methods developed to tackle the road sign recognition problem         are reviewed, and a comparison of the features of these methods is given. Second, the developed road sign recognition system         is described. The system is capable of analysing live colour road scene images, detecting multiple road signs within each         image, and classifying the type of road signs detected. The system consists of two modules: detection and classification.         The detection module segments the input image in the hue-saturation-intensity colour space, and then detects road signs using         a Multi-layer Perceptron neural-network. The classification module determines the type of detected road signs using a series         of one to one architectural Multi-layer Perceptron neural networks. Two sets of classifiers are trained using the Resillient-Backpropagation         and Scaled-Conjugate-Gradient algorithms. The two modules of the system are evaluated individually first. Then the system         is tested as a whole. The experimental results demonstrate that the system is capable of achieving an average recognition         hit-rate of 95.96% using the scaled-conjugate-gradient trained classifiers.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Chi Sing Leung1  | Frank H.

Check-dams are effective measures for soil and water         conservation; concomitantly check-dam planning and construction urgently require current land use maps. Remote sensing technique         plays a key role in achieving up-to-date land use maps. However, limited by the impact of hilly and gully terrain in the loess         plateau, commonly used classifier for remote sensing data cannot achieve satisfactory results. In this paper, HongShiMao watershed         in the loess plateau was chosen as the study area. Decision tree classifier (DTC) based on a genetic algorithm (GA) was applied         to the land use classification automatically. Compared with the results by iterative self-organizing data analysis technique         (ISODATA), GA-based DTC had much better results. Its total accuracy was 83.2% with a Kappa coefficient 0.807. The results         also showed that most part of the study area belonged to the barren land with sparse grass or crop cover that attributed to         the soil erosion and runoff.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Yonggui Kao1| 3  | Cunchen Gao2</authors><title>Global exponential stability analysis for cellular neural networks with variable coefficients and delays      </title><content>Some sufficient conditions for the global exponential stability of cellular neural networks with variable coefficients and         time-varying delays are obtained by a method based on a delayed differential inequality.

We assume that a set of templates are available first. To avoid making strong assumptions         about distributional structure while still retaining good properties for estimation, the classical statistical model, histogram,         is used to summarize the response of each template. By introducing a novel &amp;#8220;Integral Histogram Image&amp;#8221;, we can compute histogram         rapidly. Then, we turn to Fisher linear discriminant for each template to project histogram from d-dimensional subspace to one-dimensional subspace. Best features, used to describe face pattern, are selected by AdaBoost         learning. The results of experiments demonstrate that the selected features are much more powerful to represent the face pattern         than the simple rectangle features used by Viola and Jones and some variants.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Xiaorong Pu1 | Zhang Yi1 | Zhongjie Fang1</authors><title>Holistic and partial facial features fusion by binary particle swarm optimization      </title><content>This paper proposes a novel binary particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm using artificial immune system (AIS) for face         recognition. Inspired by face recognition ability in human visual system (HVS), this algorithm fuses the information of the         holistic and partial facial features. The holistic facial features are extracted by using principal component analysis (PCA),         while the partial facial features are extracted by non-negative matrix factorization with sparseness constraints (NMFs). Linear         discriminant analysis (LDA) is then applied to enhance adaptability to illumination and expression. The proposed algorithm         is used to select the fusion rules by minimizing the Bayesian error cost. The fusion rules are finally applied for face recognition.

This paper outlines the two main classes of learning methods to deal with partly labeled data: pre-labeling-based learning         and semi-supervised learning. Concretely, we introduce and discuss three methods from each class. The first three ones are         two-stage methods consisting of selecting the data to be labeled and then training the classifier using the pre-labeled and         the originally labeled data. The last three ones show how labeled and unlabeled data can be combined in a symbiotic way during         training. The empirical evaluation of these methods shows: (1) pre-labeling methods tend be better than semi-supervised learning         methods, (2) both labeled and unlabeled have positive effect on the classification accuracy of each of the proposed methods,         (3) the combination of all the methods improve the accuracy, and (4) the proposed methods compare very well with the state-of-art         methods.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Jianhua Zhang1  | Hong Wang2 </authors><title>Minimum entropy control of nonlinear ARMA systems over a communication network      </title><content>In this paper, the entropy concept has been utilized to characterize the uncertainty of the tracking error for nonlinear ARMA         stochastic systems over a communication network, where time delays in the communication channels are of random nature.

In this study we use four competing methodologies to model and         forecast the behavior of these short term Federal Fund interest rates. These methodologies are: time series, Taylor, econometric         and neural network. The time series forecasts use only past values of Federal Funds rates. The celebrated Taylor rule methodology         theorizes that the Federal Fund rate values are influenced solely by deviations from a desired level of inflation and from         potential output. The econometric and neural network models have inputs used by both the time series and Taylor rule. Using         monthly data from 1958 to the end of 2005 we distinguish between sample and out-of-sample sets to train, evaluate, and compare         the models&amp;#8217; effectiveness. Our results indicate that the econometric modeling performs better than the other approaches when         the data are divided into two sets of pre-Greenspan and Greenspan periods.

Five discriminating         features are automatically extracted from fMRI data by a sequence of temporal-sliding-windows. A fuzzy model based on these         features is first derived by a gradient method on a set of initial training data and then incrementally enhanced. The resulting         fuzzy activation maps of all subjects are then combined to provide a measure of strength of activation of each voxel, based         on the group of subjects. A two-way thresholding scheme is introduced to determine true activated voxels. The method is tested         on both synthetic and real fMRI datasets. The method is less vulnerable to correlated noise and able to capture the key activation         from a group of subjects by adapting to hemodynamic variability across subjects.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Xue-fa Hu1| Zhen Zhao1 | Shu Wang1| Fu-li Wang1| Da-kuo He1 | Shui-kang Wu2</authors><title>Multi-stage extreme learning machine for fault diagnosis on hydraulic tube tester      </title><content>The running status of hydraulic tube tester is reflected by the boosting pressure curve in Hydrostatic testing process.

Different         from the conventional usages, neural network is herein attempted to handle factor sensitivity analysis in a geotechnical engineering         system. After systematically investigating instability of employing single neural network in factor sensitivity analysis,         a neural network committee (NNC)-based sensitivity analysis strategy is first algorithmically presented based on the particular         mathematical ideas of weak law of large numbers in probability and optimization. Significantly, this study especially emphasizes         the practical application of the NNC-based sensitivity analysis strategy to highlight the mechanism underlying in strata movement.         The principal goal is to reveal the relationships among influential factors on strata movement through estimating the relative         contribution of each explicative (input) variable on dependent (output) variables of strata movement. It is demonstrated that         the NNC-based sensitivity analysis strategy rationally not only reveals the relative contribution of each explicative variable         on dependent variables but also indicates the predictability of each dependent variable. In addition, an improved prediction         model is resulted from integrating the sensitivity analysis results into neural network modeling, and it is capable of facilitating         the convergence training of neural network model and advancing its prediction precision on strata movement angles. The above         outcomes indicate that the NNC-based sensitivity analysis strategy provides a new paradigm of applying neural networks to         deal with complex geotechnical engineering problems.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Jia Ma1 | Tao Yang1 | Zeng-Guang Hou1 | Min Tan1  | Derong Liu2 </authors><title>Neurodynamic programming: a case study of the traveling salesman problem      </title><content>The paper focuses on the study of solving the large-scale traveling salesman problem (TSP) based on neurodynamic programming.

In essence,         both of them try to learn an appropriate evaluation function on the basis of a finite amount of experience. To evaluate their         performances, some computational experiments on both the Euclidean and asymmetric TSP instances are conducted. In contrast         with the large size of the state space, only a few training sets have been used to obtain the initial results. Hence, the         results are acceptable and encouraging in comparisons with some classical algorithms, and further study of this kind of methods,         as well as applications in combinatorial optimization problems, is worth investigating.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Isar Nejadgholi1  | Seyyed Ali Seyyedsalehi1 </authors><title>Nonlinear normalization of input patterns to speaker variability in speech recognition neural networks      </title><content>The issue of input variability resulting from speaker changes is one of the most crucial factors influencing the effectiveness         of speech recognition systems. A solution to this problem is adaptation or normalization of the input, in a way that all the         parameters of the input representation are adapted to that of a single speaker, and a kind of normalization is applied to         the input pattern against the speaker changes, before recognition. This paper proposes three such methods in which some effects         of the speaker changes influencing speech recognition process is compensated. In all three methods, a feed-forward neural         network is first trained for mapping the input into codes representing the phonetic classes and speakers. Then, among the         71 speakers used in training, the one who is showing the highest percentage of phone recognition accuracy is selected as the         reference speaker so that the representation parameters of the other speakers are converted to the corresponding speech uttered         by him. In the first method, the error back-propagation algorithm is used for finding the optimal point of every decision         region relating to each phone of each speaker in the input space for all the phones and all the speakers. The distances between         these points and the corresponding points related to the reference speaker are employed for offsetting the speaker change         effects and the adaptation of the input signal to the reference speaker. In the second method, using the error back-propagation         algorithm and maintaining the reference speaker data as the desirable speaker output, we correct all the speech signal frames,         i.e., the train and the test datasets, so that they coincide with the corresponding speech of the reference speaker. In the         third method, another feed-forward neural network is applied inversely for mapping the phonetic classes and speaker information         to the input representation. The phonetic output retrieved from the direct network along with the reference speaker data are         given to the inverse network. Using this information, the inverse network yields an estimation of the input representation         adapted to the reference speaker. In all three methods, the final speech recognition model is trained using the adapted training         data, and is tested by the adapted testing data. Implementing these methods and combining the final network results with un-adapted         network based on the highest confidence level, an increase of 2.1, 2.6 and 3% in phone recognition accuracy on the clean speech         is obtained from the three methods, respectively.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Dingguo Chen1 | Jiaben Yang2  | Ronald R.

Control design for nonlinear systems with uncertain components is usually carried out         on a per system basis, especially when physical control constraints, and certain control performance measures such as optimum         time control are imposed. Elegant adaptive control techniques are difficult to apply to this type of problems.

In this paper, by supposing a parametric Gaussian distribution         over the image space (spanned by the row vectors of 2D image matrices) and a spherical Gaussian noise model for the image,         we endow the 2DPCA with a probabilistic framework called probabilistic 2DPCA (P2DPCA), which is robust to noise. Further,         by using the probabilistic perspective of P2DPCA, we extend the P2DPCA to a mixture of local P2DPCA models (MP2DPCA). The         MP2DPCA offers us a method of being able to model faces in unconstrained (complex) environment.

The inverse problem         is to determine the sample structure information from measured spectra, which can be defined as a function approximation problem.         We propose using radial basis function (RBF) neural networks to approximate an inverse function. Each RBS spectrum, which         may contain up to 128 data points, is compressed by the principal component analysis, so that the dimensionality of input         data and complexity of the network are reduced significantly. Our theoretical consideration is tested by numerical experiments         with the example of the SiGe thin film sample and corresponding backscattering spectra. A comparison of the RBF method with         multilayer perceptrons reveals that the former has better performance in extracting structural information from spectra. Furthermore,         the proposed method can handle redundancies properly, which are caused by the constraint of output variables.

Wavelet analysis has been used for signal processing         module. In the feature extraction module, feature vector of the sensor faults has been constructed using wavelet analysis,         sliding window, absolute maximum value changing ratio and variance changing ratio as a statistical analysis. For the feature         cluster module, the self-organizing map (SOM), which is a subtype of artificial neural network has been applied as a classifier         of the feature vector. As a benchmark process three-tank system has been used. Control of the three-tank system is provided         by fuzzy logic controller. Faults are applied to three level sensors. Sensor faults represent incorrect reading from the sensors         that the system is equipped with. When a particular fault occurs in the system, a suitable control scheme has been selected         on-line by supervisor functionality to maintain the closed-loop performance of the system. Active FTC has been achieved by         switch mode control using fuzzy logic controller. Simulation results show that benchmark process has maintained acceptable         performance with FTC for the sensor faults. As a result, when the system has sensor faults soft computing and signal processing         based FTC helps for the best performance of the system.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Mizuki Ihara1 | Shin-ichi Maeda2  | Shin Ishii2 </authors><title>Solo instrumental music analysis using the source-filter model as a sound production model considering temporal dynamics      </title><content>A source-filter model, originally devised to represent a sound production process, has been widely used to estimate both of         the source signal which includes pitch information and the synthesis filter which includes vowel information, as from sounds         of a speech signal. We use this model to identify instruments by their instrumental sound signal. However, this model suffers         from an indeterminacy problem. To resolve it, we employ three elements of the sound: loudness, pitch and timbre. Our assumption         is that the source signal is represented by time-varying pitch and amplitude, and the synthesis filter by time-invariant line         spectral frequency parameters. We construct a probabilistic model that represents our assumption with an extension of the         source-filter model. For learning of model parameters, we employed an EM-like minimization algorithm of a cost function called         the free energy. Reconstruction of the spectrum with the estimated source signal and synthesis filter, and instrument identification         by using the model parameters of the estimated synthesis filter are performed to evaluate our approach, showing that this         learning scheme could achieve simultaneous estimation of the source signal and the synthesis filter.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Xiao-Zhi Gao1 | Mo-Yuen Chow1| David Pelta1 | Jon Timmis1</authors><title>Special Issue on Artificial Immune Systems: Theory and Applications      </title><content>Without Abstract</content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Maria NazarГ© Munari Angeloni Hahne1  | Fern|o Mendes de Azevedo1 </authors><title>Study on IAC networks models: learning and stability      </title><content>This paper presents a methodology that uses evolutionary learning in training &amp;#8216;A&amp;#8217; model networks, a topology based on Interactive         Activation and Competition (IAC) neural networks. IAC networks show local knowledge and processing units clustered in pools.         The connections among units may assume only 1, 0 or &amp;#8722;1. On the other hand, &amp;#8216;A&amp;#8217; model network uses values in interval [&amp;#8722;1,         1]. This feature provides a wider range of applications for this network, including problems which do not show mutually exclusive         concepts. However, there is no algorithm to adjust the network weights and still preserve the desired characteristics of the         original network. Accordingly, we propose the use of genetic algorithms in a new methodology to obtain the correct weight         set for this network. Two examples are used to illustrate the proposed method. Findings are considered consistent and generic         enough to allow further applications on similar classes of problems suitable for &amp;#8216;A&amp;#8217; model IAC Networks.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>A.

In the design of these neural networks there are several stages where, the most critical stage is the initialization         of the centers of each RBF since the rest of the steps to design the RBFNN strongly depend on it. The improved clustering         for function approximation (ICFA) algorithm was recently introduced and proved successful for the function approximation problem.         In the ICFA algorithm, a fuzzy partition of the input data is performed but, a fuzzy partition can behave inadequately in         noise conditions. Possibilistic and mixed approaches, combining fuzzy and possibilistic partitions, were developed in order         to improve the performance of a fuzzy partition. In this paper, a study of the influence of replacing the fuzzy partition         used in the ICFA algorithm with the possibilistic and the fuzzy-possibilistic partitions will be done. A comparative analysis         of each kind of partition will be performed in order to see if the possibilistic approach can improve the performance of the         ICFA algorithm both in normal and in noise conditions. The results will show how the employment of a mixed approach combining         fuzzy and possibilistic approach can lead to improve the results when designing RBFNNs.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>M.

In a mobile robot the         standard mnSOM is not applicable as it is, because it is based on the assumption that class labels are known a;priori. In         a mobile robot, only a sequence of data without segmentation is available. Hence, we propose to decompose it into many subsequences,         supposing that a class label does not change within a subsequence. Accordingly, training of mnSOM is done for each subsequence         in contrast to that for each class in the standard mnSOM. The resulting mnSOM demonstrates good segmentation performance of         94.05% for a novel dataset.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>R. Ghazali1 | A. J. Hussain1| P.

The RPNN is constructed from a number of increasing orders of Pi&amp;#8211;Sigma units, which are used to         capture the underlying patterns in financial time series signals and to predict future trends in the financial market. In         particular, this paper systematically investigates a method of pre-processing the financial signals in order to reduce the         influence of their trends. The performance of the networks is benchmarked against the performance of MLPs, functional link         neural networks (FLNN), and Pi&amp;#8211;Sigma neural networks (PSNN). Simulation results clearly demonstrate that RPNNs generate higher         profit returns with fast convergence on various noisy financial signals.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Marjan Kaedi1 | Naser Movahhedinia1 | Kamal Jamshidi1</authors><title>Traffic signal timing using two-dimensional correlation, neuro-fuzzy and queuing based neural networks      </title><content>Optimizing the traffic signal control has an essential impact on intersections efficiency in urban transportation. This paper         presents a two-stage method for intersection signal timing control. First, the traffic volume is predicted using a neuro-fuzzy         network called Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The inputs of this network include two-dimensional, hourly and         daily, traffic volume correlations. In the second stage, appropriate signal cycle and optimized timing of each phase of the         signal are estimated using a combination of Self Organizing and Hopfield neural networks. The energy function of the Hopfield         network is based on a traffic model derived by queuing analysis. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated         for real data. The two-dimensional correlation presents superior performance compared to hourly traffic correlation. The evaluation         of proposed overall method shows considerable intersection throughput improvement comparing to the results taken form Synchro         software.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Maria do Carmo Nicoletti1 | Lucas Baggio Figueira2  | Estevam R.

In order         to examine the possibilities of such transfer, it proposes and evaluates a system that implements a collaborative scheme,         where a particular type of neural network induced by the neural system RuleNet is used by an exemplar-based system (NGE) to         carry on a learning task. The proposed collaboration between the two learning models implemented as the hybrid system RuleNet&amp;#8594;NGE         is feasible due to the similarity of the concept description languages employed by both. The paper also describes a few experiments         conducted; results show that the RuleNet-NGE collaboration is plausible and, in some domains, it improves the performance         of NGE on its own.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Muhammad R.

Euclidean fuzzy similarity enables a zero similarity         calculation between an unknown odor vector and hidden unit vectors, so that the system can recognize the unknown odor. In         addition, an elliptical approach for fuzziness determination is proposed. The elliptical approach can approximate an appropriate         fuzziness, so that the unknown odor recognition accuracy is improved. Experiments on three datasets of three-mixture vegetal         odors show that the recognition accuracy of the proposed method is 20% better than those of the conventional method. The system         is very promising to be used for a real development of dog robot that enables localization and identification of dangerous         natural gas.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Ben Van Calster1 | Dirk Timmerman2| Ian T.

Automatic relevance determination (ARD) was used to select the most relevant inputs. Fivefold         cross-validation (5CV) and repeated 5CV was used to select the optimal combination of input set and number of hidden neurons.         Results indicate good performance of the models with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.93&amp;#8211;0.94         on independent data. Comparison with a linear benchmark model and a previously developed logistic regression model shows that         the present problem is very well linearly separable. A resampling analysis further shows that the number of hidden neurons         specified in the ARD analyses for input selection may influence model performance. This paper shows that Bayesian MLPs, although         not frequently used, are a useful tool for detecting malignant ovarian tumours.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>John A. Bullinaria1 </authors><title>Using evolution to improve neural network learning: pitfalls and solutions      </title><content>Autonomous neural network systems typically require fast learning and good generalization performance, and there is potentially a trade-off between the two. The use of evolutionary techniques         to improve the learning abilities of neural network systems is now widespread. However, there are a range of different evolutionary         approaches that could be applied, and no systematic investigation has been carried out to find which work best. In this paper,         such an investigation is presented, and it is shown that a range of evolutionary techniques can generate high performance         networks, but they often lead to unwanted side effects, such as occasional instances of very poor performance. The nature         of these problems are explored further, and it is shown how the evolution of age dependent plasticities and/or the use of         ensemble techniques can alleviate them. A range of techniques are thus identified, with differing properties, that can be         matched to the specific requirements of each application.      </content></document><document><year>2002</year><authors>Yongyong He1| Fulei Chu1 | Binglin Zhong1</authors><title>A Hierarchical Evolutionary Algorithm for Constructing and Training Wavelet Networks      </title><content/></document><document><year>2002</year><authors>K.-z.

A total of six different               formulations containing various matrix ratios of substance to control the release rate of theophylline were used for experimentation.               By using the leave-one-out cross-validation approach, the dissolution profiles of all the matrix ratios were consumed for               training, except for one set that was taken as a reference profile, with which the network predicted profiles were compared.               Performance of the network was assessed using the similarity factor, f         2         , a criterion for dissolution profile comparison recommended by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Simulation               results indicated that the Elman network was capable of predicting dissolution profiles that were similar to the reference               profiles with an error of less than 8%. In addition, the Bootstrap method was used to estimate the confidence intervals of               the f         2         values. The results revealed the potential of a neural-network-based intelligent system in solving non-linear time-series               prediction problems in pharmaceutical product development.               </content></document><document><year>2002</year><authors>D.

Both techniques are briefly described and their performance compared for analysing simulated               and actual spectral peaks. Evaluated on 500 peaks with statistical uncertainties corresponding to a peak count of 100, average               absolute errors for the peak height, position and width are 4.9%, 2.9% and 4.2% for AIM, versus 3.3%, 0.5% and 7.7% for the               LS. AIM is better for the width, while LS is more accurate for the position. LS errors are more biased, under-estimating the               peak position and over-estimating the peak width. Tentative CPU time comparison indicates a five-fold speed advantage for               AIM, which also has a constant execution time, while LS time depends upon the peak width.               </content></document><document><year>2002</year><authors>John MacIntyre</authors><title>Editorial      </title><content>Without Abstract</content></document><document><year>2002</year><authors>John MacIntyre</authors><title>Editorial      </title><content>Without Abstract</content></document><document><year>2002</year><authors>D.

Ground level concentrations of pollutants were analysed in the area               of Ravenna, in particular the high levels of SO2 occurring during relatively rare episodes. These events are typically correlated with many different aspects, like complex               local meteorology, topography, and industrial emissions parameters. In many cases, during these episodes, the deterministic               models (e.g. Gaussian models) fail to explain the high ground level concentrations. The neural networks are trained with a               Bayesian learning scheme.               </content></document><document><year>2000</year><authors>A. Lotfi1| M. Howarth1 | J. B.

Various methods have been proposed for effective tool condition monitoring (TCM), and currently it is generally accepted that the indirect sensor-based approach is the best practical solution to reliable TCM. Furthermore, in recent years, neural networks (NNs) have been shown to model successfully, the complex relationships between input feature sets of sensor signals and tool wear data. NNs have several properties that make them ideal for effectively handling noisy and even incomplete data sets. There are several NN paradigms which can be combined to model static and dynamic systems. Another powerful method of modeling noisy dynamic systems is by using hidden Markov models (HMMs), which are commonly employed in modern speech-recognition systems. The use of HMMs for TCM was recently proposed in the literature. Though the results of these studies were quite promising, no comparative results of competing methods such as NNs are currently available. This paper is aimed at presenting a comparative evaluation of the performance of NNs and HMMs for a TCM application. The methods are employed on exactly the same data sets obtained from an industrial turning operation. The advantages and disadvantages of both methods are described, which will assist the condition-monitoring community to choose a modeling method for other applications.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>A comparative study for forecasting using neural networks vs genetically identified Box&amp;amp;Jenkins models</authors><title>This paper aims to discuss the results and conclusions of an extensive comparative study on the forecasting performance between two different techniques: a genetic expert system in which a genetic algorithm carries out the identification stage embraced in the three- phase Box&amp;amp;Jenkins univariate methodology; and a connectionist approach. At the heart of the former, an expert system rules the identification-estimation-diagnostic checking cyclical process to end up with the predictions provided by the SARIMA model which best fits the data. We will present the connectionist approach as technically equivalent to the latter process and due to its, alas, lack of any conclusive existent algorithm able to identify both the optimal model and architecture for a given problem, the three most common models presently at use and 20 different architectures for each model will be examined. It seems natural that if a comparison is to be made in order to provide a straight answer as to whether or not a connectionist approach outperforms the univariate Box&amp;amp;Jenkins methodology, the benchmark should clearly be the set of time series analysed in the work Time Series Analysis. Forecasting and Control by G. E. Box and G. M. Jenkins. Series BJA through to BJG give a total of 1200 plus measures to evaluate and compare the predictive power for different models, architectures, prediction horizons and pre-processing transformations.</title></document></documents>
