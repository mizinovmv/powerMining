Title: Generacion de trayectorias en sistemas diferencialmente planos   Trajectory generation of differentially flat systems
Abstract: The aim of this work is to develop a method for trajectory generation of nonlinear control systems with the property of differential  flatness.  This property allows to reduce the problem of generating  dynamically constrained trajectories in the state space, into the  simpler problem of constructing curves constrained to satisfy some  determined boundary conditions in the flat output space.  The general problem have been restricted to the case of systems that can be  transformed into a linear controllable system, via state feedback,  as these systems enjoy a differential flatness property of 0 order  and may be suitably handled by using well known algorithms.  9 Refs.

Title: Three-dimensional nonlinear H-infinity guidance design and  H-infinity-based pursuit-evasion game
Abstract: There are five features in this approach: 1. The complete nonlinear  dynamics of the pursuit-evasion motion is considered in  three-dimensional spherical coordinate system.  Neither linearization nor small signal assumptions are made.  2. The nonlinear H-infinity  guidance design is derived analytically and expressed in a very  simple form.  3. Unlike adaptive control concept, implementation of  the proposed H// infinity guidance design does not need the  information on target acceleration while ensuring acceptable  intercept performance for arbitrary targets with the finite  acceleration.  4. The derived guidance design exhibits strong  robustness against variations in target acceleration.  5. Finally the issues related to the validation of the control law using Hardware  In The Loop simulation are presented.  The effects of the Flight  Motion Simulator static and dynamic accuracies (time delay etc...)  are discussed.  6 Refs.

Title: Robust state-feedback H// infinity control of a nonlinear two-mass  system
Abstract: In this paper a positioning control of a nonlinear elastically  coupled two-mass system is presented.  Structures of two-mass systems can often be found e.g. in robotics or machine tools.  The contained  mechanical parts, like gears and shafts, can lead to limited cycles  and stick-slip effects.  In order to avoid the unwanted effects an  H// infinity control design is used for the system.  In the control  parameter uncertainties and elastic torsion are also taken into  account.  In the standard H// infinity control structure a basic  change is needed.  This leads to a state-feedback H// infinity  control.  The result is a linear H// infinity control, that can  handle the nonlinear system.  The control shows good dynamics,  robustness and can handle disturbances.  Measured results are shown  in this paper.  12 Refs.

Title: Fuzzy logic controller capable of emulating a PID
Abstract: This paper describes a way of achieving a Fuzzy Controller that can  be adjusted to perform in the same way as conventional PID  controller.  This provides a starting point in the process of setting up a Fuzzy Logic controller meant to replace a PID.  The purpose of  this would be to avoid the possibly erratic behavior of the  controlled process when a Fuzzy Controller without a pre-determined  or proven tuning first replaces a PID.  An example is given to show  how this emulation method helps in the initial setup of a Fuzzy  Controller in a Non Linear process.  Robustness of the Fuzzy  Controller in this non-linear process is shown to be better than the one obtained with the PID controller.  4 Refs.

Title: H// infinity fuzzy estimation for a class of nonlinear discrete-time  dynamic systems
Abstract: This paper studies H// infinity fuzzy filtering design for state  estimation of nonlinear discrete-time systems with bounded but  unknown disturbances.  First, the Takagi and Sugeno fuzzy model is  proposed to represent a nonlinear system.  Next, using a linear  matrix inequality (LMI) approach, the H// infinity fuzzy filtering  problems are characterized in terms of a linear matrix inequality  problem (LMIP).  The LMIP can be efficiently solved using convex  optimization techniques.  Simulation examples are given to illustrate the design procedure and the applicability of the proposed method.   The results indicate that the proposed method is suitable for  practical applications.  33 Refs.

Title: Synchronization in arrays of coupled nonlinear systems: Passivity,  circle criterion, and observer design
Abstract: It has been shown that synchronization between two non-linear systems can be studied as a control-theory problem.  We show that this  relationship can be extended to synchronization in arbitrary coupled arrays of nonlinear systems.  In particular, we use several  well-known stability conditions to obtain synchronization criteria  in arbitrarily coupled arrays: the passivity criterion, the circle  criterion and a result on observer design of Lipschitz nonlinear  systems.  We also study how these synchronization criteria depend on  the topology of the coupled networks.  In particular, we show that  synchronization is improved by using nonlocal connections or  introducing random connections.  33 Refs.

Title: A regulator for a class of unknown continuous-time nonlinear systems
Abstract: We introduce a control law for a class of unknown nonlinear  continuous-time systems in which full state measurements are  available.  We show that as long as a certain feedback gain parameter is sufficiently large, the closed-loop system is stable.   Furthermore, the magnitude of the control is bounded in the limit.   As a corollary to the main result, we show that first-order  nonlinear systems in the class we consider can be stabilized using  linear proportional integral controllers, and we give explicit  tuning rules for these controllers. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Stabilization of Hamiltonian systems with nonholonomic constraints  based on time-varying generalized canonical transformations
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the stabilization of nonholonomic  systems in port-controlled Hamiltonian formulae based on  time-varying generalized canonical transformations.  A special class  of time-varying generalized canonical transformations are introduced which modify the kinetic energy of the original system without  changing the generalized Hamiltonian structure with passivity.   Utilizing these transformations, time-varying asymptotically  stabilizing controllers for the nonholonomic Hamiltonian systems are derived.  Since the proposed method is a natural generalization of  passivity based control for conventional holonomic systems, it is  expected that the tools developed for conventional systems will be  applicable to nonholonomic systems based on the proposed method.   copy Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: An H// infinity design approach for neural net-based control schemes
Abstract: This note presents an H// infinity design approach for a neural  net-based control scheme.  In this scheme, a class of nonlinear  systems is approximated by two multilayer perceptrons.  The neural  networks are piecewisely interpolated to generate a linear  differential inclusion model.  Based on this model, a state feedback  control law is designed.  The H// infinity control is specified to  eliminate the effect of approximation errors and external  disturbances to achieve desired performance.  It is shown that  finding the permissible control gain matrices can be transformed to  a standard linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem and solved using  the convex optimization method.  14 Refs.

Title: Controlled Lagrangians and the stabilization of mechanical systems  II: Potential shaping
Abstract: We extend the method of controlled Lagrangians (CL) to include  potential shaping, which achieves complete state-space asymptotic  stabilization of mechanical systems.  The CL method deals with  mechanical systems with symmetry and provides symmetry-preserving  kinetic shaping and feedback-controlled dissipation for state-space  stabilization in all but the symmetry variables.  Potential shaping  complements the kinetic shaping by breaking symmetry and stabilizing the remaining state variables.  The approach also extends the method  of controlled Lagrangians to include a class of mechanical systems  without symmetry such as the inverted pendulum on a cart that  travels along an incline.  47 Refs.

Title: Chattering-free sliding mode control for a class of nonlinear  mechanical systems
Abstract: Second-order sliding mode control (2-smc) and dynamic sliding mode  control (dsmc) eliminate the disturbing characteristic of chattering in static sliding mode control under the assumption that the  derivative of the sliding surface is available or complex  inequalities at the acceleration level can be constructed.  In this  paper, passivity-based adaptive and non-adaptive chattering-free  sliding mode controllers are proposed assuming that the upper bound  of the norm of the derivative of the sliding surface is available, a weaker and easy to implement assumption in comparison to those of  2-smc and dsmc.  The closed-loop system accounts explicitly for the  invariance condition without reaching phase, and therefore for a  desired transient response with global exponential convergence of  tracking errors.  Preliminary experiments are presented.  35 Refs.

Title: An algorithm for the structural analysis of state space: synthesis of nonlinear observers
Abstract: The problem addressed is the linearization of multi-input  multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems by a generalized state  coordinates transformation and generalized input-output injection,  in order to design an observer.  This observer will have linear error dynamics.  The goal is to bring together two observers design  approaches: a structural one and a numerical one.  Necessary and  sufficient conditions for the existence of a linearizing generalized state transformation are obtained by an algebraic way and without  computing the input-output differential equations.  The main result  tests integrability conditions of differential one-forms derived  from the state space representation and is applicable to a large  subclass of nonlinear systems.  22 Refs.

Title: State-feedback H// infinity control of nonlinear singularly perturbed systems
Abstract: We study the H// infinity control problem for an affine singularly  perturbed system, which is nonlinear in the state variables.  Under  suitable assumptions on the linearized problem, we construct  epsilon-independent composite and linear controllers that solve the  local H// infinity control problem for the full-order system for all small enough epsilon.  These controllers solve also the corresponding problem for the descriptor system.  The 'central' nonlinear  controller can be approximated in the form of expansions in the  powers of epsilon.  An illustrative example shows that the  higher-order approximate controller achieves the better performance, while the composite (zero-order approximate) controller leads to the better performance than the linear one.  12 Refs.

Title: A suboptimal learning control scheme for non-linear systems with  time-varying parametric uncertainties
Abstract: In this paper, learning control is integrated with non-linear optimal control to enhance control performance of a class of non-linear  systems with time-varying parametric uncertainties.  A suboptimal  control strategy based on a control Lyapunov function (CLF) and  Sontag's formula provides suboptimal performance as well as  stability along the time horizon for the nominal part of the  non-linear dynamic system.  The proposed learning mechanism learns  the unknown time-varying parametric uncertainties so as to eliminate uncertain effects.  System information both in time horizon and  learning repetition horizon are incorporated in a composite energy  function (CEF).  The proposed control scheme achieves asymptotic  convergence along the learning repetition horizon and boundedness  and pointwise convergence of the tracking error (perfect tracking  performance) along the time horizon.  9 Refs.

Title: Nonlinear feedback stabilization of a rotating body-beam without  damping
Abstract: This paper deals with nonlinear feedback stabilization problem of a  flexible beam clamped at a rigid body and free at the other end.  We  assume that there is no damping and the feedback law proposed here  consists of a nonlinear control torque applied to the rigid body and either a boundary control moment or a nonlinear boundary control  force or both of them applied to the free end of the beam.  This  nonlinear feedback, which insures the exponential decay of the beam  vibrations, extends the linear case studied by Laousy et al. to a  more general class of controls.  25 Refs.

Title: A new method to obtain decay rate estimates for dissipative systems
Abstract: We consider the wave equation damped with a boundary nonlinear  velocity feedback rho(u prime ). Under some geometrical conditions,  we prove that the energy of the system decays to zero with an  explicit decay rate estimate even if the function rho has not a  polynomial behavior in zero.  This work extends some results of  Nakao, Haraux, Zuazua and Komornik, who studied the case where the  feedback has a polynomial behavior in zero and completes a result of Lasiecka and Tataru.  The proof is based on the construction of a  special weight function (that depends on the behavior of the  function rho in zero), and on a new nonlinear integral inequality.   35 Refs.

Title: Discrete-time robot visual feedback in 3-D positioning tasks with  depth adaptation
Abstract: In this paper, an adaptive visual feedback scheme is designed to  perform 3-D positioning tasks.  The dynamic camera-object interaction model is derived in discrete time, since the visual sampling time is not negligible at the current state of technology.  Active contours  are used to track the 2-D projection of the visible object's surface in the image plane.  Uniform asymptotic stability of the image  reference set-point is proved using Lyapunov's direct method, and a  3-D estimation procedure, based on prediction errors, is used to  cope with the unknown depth of the object.  Experimental results with a 6-DOF robot manipulator in eye-in-hand configuration validate the  theoretical framework in real conditions.  21 Refs.

Title: The local solvability of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE around a  nonhyperbolic critical point
Abstract: We show the existence of a local solution to a  Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) PDE around a critical point where the  corresponding Hamiltonian ODE is not hyperbolic, i.e., it has  eigenvalues on the imaginary axis.  Such problems arise in nonlinear  regulation, disturbance rejection, gain scheduling, and linear  parameter varying control.  The proof is based on an extension of the center manifold theorem due to Aulbach, Flockerzi, and Knobloch.  The method is easily extended to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) PDE.   Software is available on the web to compute local approximtate  solutions of HJB and HJI PDEs.  23 Refs.

Title: Control of a class of nonlinear discrete-time systems using  multilayer neural networks
Abstract: A multilayer neural-network (NN) controller is designed to deliver a  desired tracking performance for the control of a class of unknown  nonlinear systems in discrete time where the system nonlinearities  do not satisfy a matching condition.  Using the Lyapunov approach,  the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the tracking error and the NN weight estimates are shown by using a novel weight updates.   Further, a rigorous procedure is provided from this analysis to  select the NN controller parameters.  The resulting structure  consists of several NN function approximation inner loops and an  outer proportional derivative (PD) tracking loop.  Simulation results are then carried out to justify the theoretical conclusions.  The net result is the design and development of an NN controller for  strict-feedback class of nonlinear discrete-time systems.  12 Refs.

Title: Numerical solutions to the Witsenhausen counterexample by  approximating networks
Abstract: Approximate solutions to the Witsenhausen counterexample are derived  by constraining the unknown control functions to take on fixed  structures containing "free" parameters to be optimized.  Such  structures are given by "nonlinear approximating networks", i.e.,  linear combinations of parametrized basis functions that benefit by  density properties in normed linear spaces.  This reduces the  original functional problem to a nonlinear programming one which is  solved via stochastic approximation.  The method yields lower values  of the costs than the ones achieved so far in the literature, and,  most of all, provides rather a complete overview of the shapes of  the optimal control functions when the two parameters that  characterize the Witsenhausen counterexample vary.  One-hidden-layer  neural networks are chosen as approximating networks.  23 Refs.

Title: Stabilization of nonlinear systems via forwarding mod left brace  L//gV right brace
Abstract: Forwarding is a tool for constructing stabilizers for nonlinear  systems.  A key step in this design technique is to find an explicit  solution to a partial differential equation (PDE), which may be hard to find-actually, the PDE may even not be solvable at all.  In this  brief note we show that it is possible to provide an additional  degree of freedom for the solution of the aforementioned PDE, hence  effectively extending the realm of application of the forwarding  methodology.  Our contribution is illustrated with the example of an  inverted pendulum with a disk inertia.  11 Refs.

Title: Hybrid control for global stabilization of the cart-pendulum system
Abstract: A globally stabilizing controller for the cart-pendulum system is  designed in this paper.  The design procedure consists of three  parts.  First, find a neighborhood of the origin in which a locally  stabilizing controller can be used.  Second, construct a linear  controller for the cart subsystem and steer the position and  velocity of the cart to the origin.  The last part is to design  several classes of bang-bang controllers and a switching strategy  which guarantee that the trajectory of the system starting from any  initial condition enters, in finite times of switching, the  neighborhood where the locally stabilizing controller is effective.   copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: Nonlinear observers: A circle criterion design and robustness  analysis
Abstract: Globally convergent observers are designed for a class of systems  with monotonic nonlinearities.  The approach is to represent the  observer error system as the feedback interconnection of a linear  system and a time-varying multivariable sector nonlinearity.  Using  LMI software, observer gain matrices are computed to satisfy the  circle criterion and, hence, to drive the observer error to zero.  In output-feedback design, the observer is combined with control laws  that ensure input-to-state stability with respect to the observer  error.  Robustness to unmodeled dynamics is achieved with a  small-gain assignment design, as illustrated on a jet engine  compressor example. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: State-space analysis and identification for a class of hysteretic  systems
Abstract: In this paper we present results on the twin subjects of system  analysis and system identification for a class of state-space  realizable dynamic systems under the influence of hysteresis.  The  class of systems in question consists of models in the form of a  linear time-invariant dynamic system in series with a differential  model of hysteresis.  It will be demonstrated that under fairly light constraints on the differential model of hysteresis, it is possible  to design a series of experiments leading towards the identification of the full state-space realization.  The approach is tested  successfully on a high-precision mechanical translation system  affected by hysteresis. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.  All rights  reserved.  11 Refs.

Title: Nonlinear control strategy applied to a shunt active power filter
Abstract: This paper presents a new nonlinear decoupling control method of a  three-phase three-wire voltage source shunt active filter.  The  currents Injected by the active filter are controlled in the  synchronous orthogonal dq frame using a decoupled feedback  linearization control method.  The reference currents are extracted  from the sensed nonlinear load currents by applying the synchronous  reference frame method.

Title: Input/output feedback linearization technique applied to a CITPR
Abstract: A new nonlinear control technique applied to a Current-Injection  Three-Phase Rectifier (CITPR) is proposed.  Based on a nonlinear  low-frequency mathematical model of the converter, the design  procedure of the proposed control technique is divided into two  steps.  Firstly, two internal feedback loops for current shaping are  elaborated on the basis of an input-output system linearization  method.  Secondly, in order to ensure the regulation of the output  voltage, an external loop is then designed taking into account the  inner current loops.  The control strategy is evaluated by simulation using Matlab/Simulink toolbox.  The numerical results obtained show  the superiority of the new control technique in comparison to the  linear one.  13 Refs.

Title: Stability analysis of parallel DC-DC converters using a nonlinear  approach
Abstract: We develop analytic methodologies for stability analysis of a  parallel DC-DC converter using its switching model, discrete model  (based on nonlinear map) and averaged model.  We use these  methodologies to investigate the dynamics of an interleaved and a  synchronized parallel DC-DC buck converter.  Using the switching and  discrete models we show the mechanism and boundaries of fast-scale  and slow-scale instabilities.  We show the difference in mechanism of fast-scale instability between the interleaved and a synchronized  converter.  The averaged model does not show this difference.  It also differs considerably (from the other two models) in prediction of  instability boundaries.  24 Refs.

Abstract: This paper presents a model reference adaptive control strategy for  active steering of 2WS cars which is realized by steer-by-wire  technology.  The ideal fixed property of a steering system which is  provided by a reference model is attained by D* control.  The  proposed method can treat the nonlinear relationships between the  slip angles and the lateral forces on tires, and the uncertainties  on the friction of the road surface, whose compensations are proved  to be very important under critical situations.  Some results of  realtime simulation with a steering equipment show the effectiveness of the proposed method.  8 Refs.

Abstract: Based on the Hamiltonian energy theory, this paper designs an  explicit nonlinear robust controller for the steam-valving system.   One sufficient condition to evaluate the disturbance-attenuation  gain under the given control law is also presented in this paper.   Since the controller design is based completely on the nonlinear  dynamic system without any linearization the nonlinear property of  the dynamic system is well preserved, which presents a new way for  nonlinear robust controller design.

Title: Nonlinear recursive filter for boost trajectories
Abstract: A nonlinear recursive algorithm is formulated for state vector and  covariance estimation of boost trajectories.  The thrust acceleration vector of the booster is modeled by a vector-differential equation  that includes effects of propellant depletion and attitude motions  resulting from gravity-turn maneuvers and other steering maneuvers.   This new dynamics model is incorporated in an extended Kalman filter with nine state variables that describe the inertial components of  position, velocity, and thrust acceleration.  Additional algorithms  are described for filter initialization using angle-only  measurements from a geostationary sensor and for detection and  estimation of the final staging event using measurement residuals.   Tracking accuracy and covariance fidelity are assessed by Monte  Carlo simulation.  20 Refs.

Title: Linear QFT control of a highly nonlinear multi-machine power system
Abstract: A quantitative feedback theory (QFT) method of Horowitz, treating  nonlinearities as equivalent disturbances, is applied to the linear  control of a multi-machine power system.  This system has a smooth  nonlinear dynamics so the original approach was simplified.  From the design point of view good results were obtained with simple  controllers (automatic voltage regulator, speed governor, power  system stabilizer) when the power system was affected by large load  variations and short circuits.  To reduce significantly the steady  state errors which appeared, a novel rotor speed error amplification scheme was employed.  This increased the autonomy of the controlled  power system to combat big distortions from normal operating  conditions.  20 Refs.

Title: Boundary control of a two-dimensional flexible rotor
Abstract: In this paper, we present the design of boundary controllers for a  two-dimensional, spinning flexible rotor system.  Specifically, we  develop a model-based boundary controller which exponentially  regulates the rotor's displacement and the angular velocity tracking error, and an adaptive boundary controller which asymptotically  achieves the same control objective while compensating for  parametric uncertainty.  As opposed to previous boundary control  work, which focused on the velocity setpoint problem and placed  restrictions on the magnitude of the desired angular velocity  setpoint, the proposed control architecture achieves angular  velocity tracking with no restrictions on the magnitude of the  desired velocity trajectory.  Experimental results conducted on a  flexible rotor tested are presented to illustrate the feasibility of implementing the proposed boundary control laws.  12 Refs.

Title: Tracking control of mobile robots without constraint on velocities
Abstract: A general tracking control problem for mobile robots is proposed and  solved using the backstepping technique.  A global result is given  for the kinematic steering system to make the tracking error  approaching to zero asymptotically.  Based on our efforts, the  proposed controller can solve both the tracking problem and the  regulation problem of mobile robots.  In particular, mobile robots  can now globally follow any differentiable with bounded velocities  path such as a straight line, a circle and the path approaching to  the origin using the proposed controller.  Moreover, the problem of  back-into-garage parking is also solved by our approach.  Some  interesting simulation results are given to illustrate the  effectiveness of the proposed tracking control laws.  27 Refs.

Title: Controller synthesis for feedback systems with saturation: An  LPV-based approach
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the controller synthesis for feedback  systems with saturation based on the LPV system representation.  The  LPV system representation, combined with use of the detailed  structure of saturation nonlinearity, enables us to reduce the  conservativeness.  In this paper, we develop a new iterative  algorithm for designing a linear time-invariant controller which  locally stabilizes the nonlinear closed-loop system and achieves the prescribed quadratic control performance.  The present design method  provides an explicit expression for a guaranteed domain of  attraction, and maximizes the estimated region of the plant states  for which the stability and the prescribed quadratic performance are satisfied.  A numerical example shows the effectiveness of the  present design method.  12 Refs.

Title: On the nonuniqueness of singular value functions and balanced  nonlinear realizations
Abstract: The notion of balanced realizations for nonlinear state space model  reduction problems was first introduced by Scherpen in 1993.   Analogous to the linear case, the so-called singular value functions of a system describe the relative importance of each state component from an input-output point of view.  In this paper it is shown that  the procedure for nonlinear balancing has some interesting  ambiguities that do not occur in the linear case.  Specifically,  distinct sets of singular value functions and balanced realizations  are possible. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights reserved.   10 Refs.

Title: Nonlinear robust control design for power system including  superconducting magnetic energy storage devices
Abstract: Recently the development of power electronics and superconducting  technology made it possible that superconducting magnetic energy  storage (SMES) took part in the power system as FACTS devices to  enhance transient stability.  In this paper, a second order robust  model of SMES is established first according to the experimental  results of SMES prototype.  Then the nonlinear robust model of the  single-machine infinite-bus power system including SMES is obtained.  Furthermore, the paper presents a procedure to obtain the nonlinear  robust control law of SMES based on feedback linearization theory.   The simulation results illustrate that the nonlinear robust  controller can restore the system after large disturbance rapidly  and improve the transient stability limits of the system, thus  increasing the capacity of transmitting power.  14 Refs.

Title: Identification and control of hammerstein-type nonlinear process
Abstract: This work presents a novel means of identification and control  Hammerstein-type nonlinear process data from a relay feedback  experiment.  The static nonlinearity part of the proposed model is  represented by an invertible function defined on an operation range.  Parameters in this function are determined by means of a simple  optimization procedure which aims to obtain a symmetric cycling  instrumental output.  Based on the instrumental output, a simple  transfer function of linear subsystem is determined.  The linear  subsystem of the model is represented in FOPDT or SOPDT form.   Notably, identification of the linear and nonlinear parts is fully  decoupled.  Finally, control of such process using the identified  model is presented.  19 Refs.

Title: Crest factor minimisation in the frequency domain
Abstract: This paper examines the minimisation of signal crest factor using a  frequency domain method.  Multisine signals are designed with their  relative harmonic phases selected to minimise the distortion  introduced by a cubic nonlinearity on the measurement of a frequency response function.  This approach is based on the observation that  low crest factor signals possess properties that reduce the  nonlinear effect.  The resulting signals are compared with other  types of low crest factor signals.  It is found that the technique  does not produce the lowest possible crest factors but that the  signals do minimise the nonlinear distortion introduced by a cubic  nonlinearity.  The signals are thus termed minimum distortion  multisines.  11 Refs.

Title: Reconstruction of nonlinearly distorted signals with regularized  inverse characteristics
Abstract: A signal distorted by a static, invertable, nonlinear characteristics can be exactly restored in the absence of noise.  In this case the  inverse of the characteristics can be used.  When noise is  superimposed to the distorted signal, the inverse characteristics  may not be proper, because the noise is strongly amplified.  This  noise has to be suppressed in the reconstructed signal, which can be accomplished only at the price of bias.  This article presents a  method to compensate the effect of static nonlinearities in the  presence of noise.  The method is based on Tikhonov's regularization  operators and provides a compromise between noisy and biased  estimates.  The proposed algorithm has been successfully applied to  reconstruct the sound of old movie-films.  5 Refs.

Abstract: In this paper, presented are a resonance type accelerometer, its  implementation and results of performance test.  The structure and  principle of resonance type accelerometer are illustrated concisely.  A pure surface micromachining technology is used for the structure  manufacturing.  Fundamental idea of this sensor is to detect  variation of effective stiffness from parallel-plated electrostatic  resonator.  Since resonant accelerometer needs to keep track of the  system's resonance point, a feedback loop called self-sustained  oscillation loop is designed.  The resonant point and its stability  robustness are analyzed using nonlinear control methodologies, i.e., describing function method and extended Nyquist stability criterion.  Environmental test and theoretical analysis confirmed that the  oscillation loop is very robust to external disturbances.  (Author  abstract) 12 Refs.

Abstract: A robust nonlinear controller for improving multi-machine power  system transient stability as well as achieving voltage regulation  is presented in this paper.

Using the  proposed approach, measurement of power angle is not necessary for  implementing the decentralized nonlinear controller.

Title: Uniting local and global controllers with robustness to vanishing  noise
Abstract: We consider control systems for which we know two stabilizing  controllers.  One is globally asymptotically stabilizing, the other  one is only locally asymptotically stabilizing but for some reason  we insist on using it in a neighborhood of the origin.  We look for a uniting control law being equal to the local feedback on a  neighborhood of the origin, equal to the global one outside of a  larger neighborhood and being a globally stabilizing controller.  We  study several solutions based on continuous, discontinuous, hybrid,  time-varying controllers.  One criterion of the selection of a  controller is the robustness of the stability to vanishing noise.   This leads us in particular to consider a kind of generalization of  Krasovskii trajectories for hybrid systems.  18 Refs.

Title: Characteristics and compensation of friction at velocity reversal
Abstract: This paper analyzes the characteristics of pre-sliding friction of  X-Y table of CNC machining center at velocity reversal, and presents a simple and effective method of friction compensation based on  these characteristics.  During velocity reversal, friction transits  from pre-sliding regime into sliding regime, and it must not be  considered as a sudden discontinuity for accurate control.  In order  to distinguish its regime at velocity reversal, the relationship  between the transition time and the acceleration at zero velocity  has been investigated using the spring-like friction model.   Furthermore, the experimental observations prove this relation.   Using the transition time estimated from the relation without any  accurate velocity information, the friction at velocity reversal can be well compensated and the experimental results show its  effectiveness.  14 Refs.

Title: Resin transfer molding: Nonlinear model development from a control  perspective
Abstract: Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) is employed in the manufacture of  complex three-dimensional polymer composite parts.  Resin cure is one of the two critical steps in RTM where the injected resin  polymerizes and crosslinks.  Because of the exothermic nature of  these reactions, the temperature evolution of the system is  distributed in time and space.  The development of computationally  tractable process models for the cure process is essential for the  development of model-based process control algorithms that minimize  the spatial gradients during the cure process.  Reduced order model  that consist of a finite number of non-linear ODE's are obtained  from detailed, continuum cure models using Proper Orthogonal  Decomposition (POD) and Galerkin Projection.  The accuracy and  predictive capabilities of such models are assessed in this work.  7  Refs.

Title: Analysis and control with performance of piecewise affine and hybrid  systems
Abstract: In this paper we investigate some analysis and control problems with  performance for discrete-time hybrid systems in the Piece-Wise  Affine form.  By using arguments from the dissipativity theory for  nonlinear systems, we show that H// infinity analysis and synthesis  problems can be formulated and solved via Linear Matrix Inequalities that take into account the switching structure of the systems.   Moreover, such procedures can be generalized in order to solve both  robust control problems and analysis/synthesis with other  performance indices like the Generalized H//2 norm.  17 Refs.

Title: Solution of a differential game formulation of military air  operations by the method of characteristics
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a zero-sum differential game formulation  for the control of military air operations.  The model consists of a  system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the dynamics of the operations and a suitably chosen quadratic payoff function.   Control variables are engagement intensities and velocities, and  there are constraints on the controls.  The method of characteristics (based on the Pontryagin maximum principle) is used to solve the  associated Hamilton-Jacobi equation.  The Hamiltonian in this  nonlinear formulation can be explicitly optimized with respect to  the controls.  Numerical simulations study the enforcement of  constraints a) by means of penalties in the payoff function or b)  explicitly.  The numerical results show robustness with respect to  various parameters.  2 Refs.

Title: Sensorless speed tracking of induction motor with unknown torque base on maximum power transfer
Abstract: In this paper, a nonlinear indirect adaptive sensorless speed  tracking controller for induction motor with the maximum power  transfer is proposed.  In this controller, only the stator currents  are assumed to be measurable.  The rotor flux and speed observers are designed to relax the need of flux and speed measurement.  Besides,  the rotor resistance estimator is also designed to cope with the  problem of the fluctuation of rotor resistance.  Stability analysis  based on Lyapunov theory is also performed to guarantee that the  controller design here is stable.  Finally, the computer simulations  and experiments are done to demonstrate the tracking performance of  our design subject to maximum power transfer.  7 Refs.

Title: Nonlinear control of induction motor with unknown rotor resistance  and load adaptation
Abstract: On the basis of a dynamic model obtained under a special nonlinear  coordinate transform on a d-q-axis model (w.r.t. the stationary  reference frame) of an induction motor, a nonlinear adaptive  controller for speed tracking control with unknown load torque is  proposed in this paper.  The controller is made to work under the  condition that all the parameters except the rotor resistance of the induction motor are known a priori.  The underlying control theories  include the indirect vector control and the maximal power transfer  of the motor.  To be rigorous, the proposed control scheme is with a  proof derived from Lyapunov stability theory.  The simulation results are also given to show the effectiveness of the presented control  scheme.  12 Refs.

A complete nonlinear model enabled  to analyze the vehicle performance and solve a spectrum of problems  in virtual prototyping.  The modeling and simulation problems were  divided into the derivation of the equations which govern the motion of the rigid-body vehicle dynamics and sub-systems behavior,  identification of actuators and motor-propulsor parameters,  analytical and numerical analysis, as well as computational solution of the system of differential equations.  The required vehicle  performance in the specified operating envelopes was achieved using  control algorithms.  (Edited abstract) 10 Refs.

Title: Integrated vehicle control via coordinated steering and wheel torque  inputs
Abstract: A controller was developed to govern the lateral position of a  highway-speed vehicle using frequency-weighted coordination of front steering and torque inputs.  The MISO design problem was recast as a  SISO approach by using a cascaded design technique: the first step  determined the relative contribution of each control input as a  function of frequency; secondary design steps utilized classical  SISO approaches.  For the vehicle control problem, the torque  steering inputs were designed to act only as high-frequency inputs,  while standard front steering was weighted for DC and low-frequency  inputs.  This controller was then tested on an experimental vehicle  system.  15 Refs.

Title: Exact sampled data representation of continuous time nonlinear  systems by finite polynomials with exactly determined coefficients
Abstract: In this paper a new time discretization scheme is presented, basing  on a Taylor series expansion of the continuous time nonlinear  system.  It is shown that any Taylor series coefficient of the  corresponding discrete-time nonlinear system can be calculated  exactly.  Therefore the notion of Lie sequences is introduced,  facilitating the calculation of Taylor-Lie series, significantly.   Since the resulting coefficient can be expressed in terms of the  matrix exponential, numerical algorithms for the determination of  each coefficient can be used.  An illustrative example quantifies the results.  9 Refs.

Title: On nonlinear modelling using velocity-based multiple model networks
Abstract: A recently proposed blended multiple model system which employs  velocity-based local linear models is applied to Continuous Stirred  Tank Reactor (CSTR) plant.  Three important practical issues are  investigated: appropriate blending of the local models, obtaining  the input derivative and suitable choice of weighting functions.   Comparison is made with a conventional multiple model system of  affine local models.  Simulation experiments illustrate and confirm  previous analytical results on the dynamical modelling superiority  of the velocity-based local model network.  Furthermore, since the  underlying local models of the velocity-based system are  continuous-time and linear, continuity is now provided with  established linear theory.  11 Refs.

Title: Adaptive control of stepper motors without current measurements
Abstract: In this paper, a robust adaptive nonlinear dynamic controller is  designed to achieve practical stabilization for position tracking  error of a voltage-fed permanent-magnet stepper motor.  The control  design is an output-feedback design that utilizes only rotor  position and velocity measurements.  Currents are not available for  feedback.  Furthermore, adaptations are utilized so that no knowledge of motor parameters is required.  The proposed controller is robust  to load torques, friction, cogging forces, and other disturbances  satisfying certain bounds.  The controller also guarantees asymptotic stabilization and set-point regulation if the torque disturbances  vanish at the setpoint.  This represents the first output-feedback  (i.e., no current measurements) results with all motor parameters  assumed unknown.  These results can also be extended to other classes of motors.  18 Refs.

Title: Decentralized tracking with disturbance attenuation by nonlinear  output feedback
Abstract: The problem of decentralized output-feedback tracking with  disturbance attenuation is addressed for a new class of large-scale  and minimum-phase nonlinear systems.  Common assumptions like  matching and growth conditions are not required for the underlying  decentralized system with a diagonal structure.  A novel  observer-based decentralized controller design is presented.  The  proposed decentralized output-feedback laws achieve asymptotic  tracking and internal Lagrange stability when the disturbance inputs disappear, and, guarantee external stability in the presence of  disturbance inputs.  These external stability properties include  Sontag's ISS and iISS conditions and standard L//2-gain property.  17 Refs.

Title: Solution to an inverse problem of locally minimax control and its  applications in robust control designs
Abstract: A given state feedback is shown to be a locally minimax control,  satisfying a Bellman-Isaacs inequality associated to a certain  linear-quadratic differential game, if and only if the so-called  generalized return difference of this feedback satisfies a  frequency-domain condition.  On this basis, we explore a new approach to robust control designs for nonlinear Lur'e systems with sector  bounded uncertainty, linear systems with time-varying norm bounded  uncertainty, and multivariable systems with uncertain  interconnections, which allows to derive easy to check a  frequency-domain test condition for a given state feedback to be the robust controller and does not require to solve matrix equations or  inequalities typical for these problems.  8 Refs.

Title: Synthesis of hierarchical neural controller for nonlinear systems
Abstract: The theoretical study on synthesis of hierarchical neural controllers for nonlinear systems affine in control is presented in this paper.   This theoretical study presents the proposed hierarchical neural  controller construction which is useful for nonlinear system  applications.  It first shows that performance criteria based optimal neural controllers can be synthesized to approximately identify the  switching manifold for control.  It then shows that the hierarchical  neural controller can deal with system uncertainties in parameters  which are fixed but unknown, and should perform reasonably well in  theory.  Further, the adaptive hierarchical neural controllers are  developed to deal with systems uncertainties in parameters which are time varying, and it is shown that they are able to perform  satisfactorily.  12 Refs.

Abstract: In this contribution we consider control of nonlinear systems by  means of linear time-invariant model based control design.  It is  shown that a desired closed loop response of the nonlinear system  for a given reference signal can be achieved using a controller  based on a linear model.  This is possible if the linear model used  in the control design is able to capture the input/output behaviour  of the nonlinear system for the desired response.  An identification  method, designed for this purpose, is presented and illustrated on  an numerical example.  26 Refs.

Title: State estimation and nonlinear model predictive control of end-use  properties in batch reactors
Abstract: There are economic incentives in controlling the end-use properties  in batch reactors to reduce the variability in the final product  quality specifications.  Here we define an approach for controlling  the properties within a desired target region, instead of a set  point, with an economic objective and with consideration of the  model uncertainty.  The approach to handling process-model mismatch  is based on determining the uncertainty in the predicted final  values of the properties, in the form of elliptical confidence  regions.  The controller then ensures that the complete confidence  region is within the target region.  A semi-infinite programming  problem is solved to find the input values for the rest of the  batch.  The methods developed here are demonstrated on an emulsion  polymerization example.  8 Refs.

An expression that can  be used to calculate an upper bound on the maximum sampling period  and time delay of infrequent measurements, is presented.  The upper  bound is the latest time at which the next infrequent measurements  should arrive to ensure that estimation error does not exceed a  desired limit.  A binary distillation flash tank is considered to  show the application and performance of the estimator.  15 Refs.

Title: Model based backslash compensation
Abstract: In this paper it was experimentally proven that defining the model of backlash allows for compensation of backslash influence by adding a  compensation component into control signal.  Initially, algebra of  blocks was used to obtain a more suitable representation of a  servosystem with backslash in transmission elements.  After having  the system modeled in such a way, it was plausible to assume (this  was confirmed by simulation) that the influence of backslash in a  nonlinear system could be substituted with an additional component  of control signal entering a linear system.  Vice versa,  incorporating that signal with the opposite sign into a nonlinear  control system would result in lowering or complete elimination of  backslash influence.  Excellent system behavior was experimentally  verified on a laboratory model, when proposed control concept was  utilized.  12 Refs.

Title: Visual feedback control of planar manipulators based on nonlinear  receding horizon control approach
Abstract: This paper deals with the vision-based robot motion control via the  nonlinear receding horizon control approach.  The visual feedback  system consists of the manipulator dynamics and the image dynamics  which is derived from the camera model.  We propose the stabilizing  receding horizon control scheme which is based on a control Lyapunov function and a corresponding feedback control law.  The control  Lyapunov function is constructed by the full Lagrangian dynamics  based on the image feature parameter potential.  The proposed scheme  employs the cost function as a Lyapunov function for establishing  stability of nonlinear receding horizon control.  The effectiveness  of the proposed scheme is illustrated by applying this approach to  the planar model of visual feedback system.  16 Refs.

Title: Infinite-step backstepping for a heat equation-like PDE with  arbitrarily many unstable eigenvalues
Abstract: We consider feedback transformations of the backstepping/feedback  linearization type that have been prevalent in finite dimensional  nonlinear stabilization, and, with the objective of ultimately  addressing nonlinear PDE's, generate the first such transformations  for a linear PDE that can have an arbitrary finite number of  open-loop unstable eigenvalues.  These transformations have the form  of recursive relationships and the fundamental difficulty is that  the recursion has an infinite number of iterations.  Naive versions  of backstepping lead to unbounded coefficients in those  transformations.  We show how to design them such that they are  sufficiently regular (not continuous but L**2).  We then establish  closed-loop stability, regularity of control, and regularity of  solutions of the PDE.  15 Refs.

Title: Adaptive compensation of dynamic friction in finite time of 1 DOF  mechanical system
Abstract: Dynamic friction provokes limit cycles and complex nonlinear  behaviors that may cause instability in mechanical systems.  This  phenomena deprives to obtain the required precision of a physical  system, and it is desirable to compensate this friction, ideally in  finite time with a continuous control law.  In this paper, a second  order adaptive sliding mode controller is proposed which guarantees  robust tracking in finite time for a simple uncertain mechanical  system subject to unknown dynamic friction.  The controller exhibits  a well-posed terminal sliding mode all the time, and the output of  the controller is chattering-free.  Extension to complex fully  actuated n degrees of freedom mechanical systems is straightforward  to obtain.  Simulation data is discussed.  13 Refs.

Abstract: This paper addresses adaptive control of sandwich nonlinear systems  having an unknown sandwiched dead-zone between the linear dynamic  blocks, as illustrated by a hydraulic valve system.  An adaptive  hybrid control scheme for control of such sandwiched dead-zone  systems is developed.  The proposed control scheme employs an  inner-loop discrete-time feedback design and an outer-loop  continuous-time feedback design, combined with an adaptive dead-zone inverse to cancel the dead-zone effect for improving output  tracking.  Tracking performance of the closed-loop control system is  analyzed.  Simulation results are used to illustrate the  effectiveness of the proposed adaptive dead-zone inverse controller.  9 Refs.

Title: A novel observer based adaptive output feedback approach for control  of uncertain systems
Abstract: We consider adaptive output feedback control of nonlinear systems.   Given a smooth reference trajectory, the problem is to design a  controller that forces the system measurement to track it with  bounded errors.  The classical approach requires building a state  observer.  However, finding a good observer for a highly nonlinear  and uncertain plant is not an obvious task.  We argue that it should  be sufficient to build an observer for the output tracking error.   Uniform ultimate boundedness of error signals is shown through  Lyapunov stability analysis.  Simulations of a nonlinear second order system illustrate the theoretical results.  19 Refs.

Title: Lyapunov-based control: Some new results and comparison with MPC
Abstract: This work presents new results on control of multivariable nonlinear  systems with uncertain variables and input constraints using a  Lyapunov-based approach.  Specifically, we explicitly synthesize  bounded robust multivariable control laws that enforce stability and robust asymptotic output tracking in the closed-loop system and  provide an explicit characterization of the region of guaranteed  closed-loop stability.  The control method is successfully applied to a multivariable chemical reactor example with uncertainty and input  constraints.  Finally, we conclude the paper with a discussion that  attempts to put in perspective the proposed Lyapunov-based approach  with respect to the nonlinear model predictive control (MPC)  approach for control of uncertain nonlinear systems with  constraints.  26 Refs.

Title: Chaotic synchronization using backstepping method with application to the Chua's circuit and Lorenz system
Abstract: In this paper, backstepping method is proposed for synchronizing  chaotic systems.  The tool consists in a recursive procedure that  combines the choice of a Lyapunov function with the design of  feedback control.  It offers a systematic design procedure for the  synchronization of a large class of continuous-time hyper-chaotic  systems, which implies that much complicated high-order chaotic  systems can be used to improve the security in chaos communications.  In order to illustrate the general applicability of backstepping  design, the tool is used to synchronize the dynamics of Chua's  circuits and Lorenz systems.  Numerical simulations are presented to  show the effectiveness of this approach.  9 Refs.

Title: Run-to-run control of DC-sputtering processes
Abstract: A new nonlinear model is proposed for describing the relationship  between the relevant inputs and outputs of a DC-magnetron sputtering system used in a manufacturing line for digital-compact discs and  other optical data-storage devices.  It is shown that the process is  intrinsically discrete, and that it has an inherent transport delay.  A control scheme is proposed consisting of a Smith predictor to  address the delayed dynamics, and a globally linearizing operator  introduced to address the nonlinear nature of the model.  The control structure requires knowledge of two model parameters, namely, the  maximum film reflectivity and the characteristic-energy factor of  the sputterer, and makes use of one tuning variable, namely, the  parameter of an integral-only controller.  The performance of the  control system is illustrated via a simulation study.  10 Refs.

Abstract: In this paper we will present a new method for the design of  nonlinear observers using Lyapunov functions.  We assume the system  in observable normal form already known from the literature.  Based  on this normal form the observer design will be carried out.  In  related work some assumptions regarding the nonlinearities are  usually made, e.g., lipshitzness or global boundedness.  We will show that a very weak growth condition, namely, montone decreasing  behaviour with respect to some variables will enable us to construct globally asymptotically stable observers using an appropriate  Lyapunov function.  An example which illustrates the power of these  new design conditions will conclude the paper.  3 Refs.

Abstract: A globally stable algorithm for jointly estimating the state and  parameters in deterministic nonlinear dynamic systems is developed.

The  result is a new method whose applicability exceeds that of many  existing techniques in that it can accommodate multi-output systems.  Several previously developed methods applicable to the same class of nonlinear system are restricted to single-output systems.  In  addition, the new method is shown to have some computational  advantages.  10 Refs.

Stability analysis is provided using the Lyapunov method, and a weight adjustment rule for the on-line learning neural network is  derived that can guarantee closed-loop stability.  9 Refs.

Title: Nonlinear discrete-time state feedback regulators with assignable  closed-loop dynamics
Abstract: The present work proposes a new approach to the nonlinear  discrete-time state feedback regulator synthesis problem with  assignable closed-loop dynamics.  The problem's formulation is  realized through a system of nonlinear functional equations and a  rather general set of necessary and sufficient conditions for  solvability is derived.  Using tools from functional equations  theory, one can prove that the solution to the above system of  nonlinear functional equations is locally analytic, and an easily  programmable series solution method can be developed.  Under a  simultaneous implementation of a nonlinear coordinate transformation and a nonlinear discrete-time state feedback control law that are  both computed through the solution of the system of nonlinear  functional equations, the feedback linearization with pole-placement design objective can be attained under rather general conditions.  14 Refs.

Title: Adaptive neuro control for output feedback nonlinear systems
Abstract: The paper is extending output feedback nonlinear control and  backstepping approaches to a class of systems approximately  diffeomorphic to output feedback systems.  The uncertainties under  consideration are of two types - parametric and non-parametric.  The  parametric ones are modeled by universal approximators such as  neural networks.  The non-parametric ones include not only  approximation errors but also some terms unmodeled by the output  feedback form.  The non-parametric terms are assumed to be bounded by unknown constants.  The backstepping procedure is applied to adapt  with respect to both parametric uncertainties and the upper bound on the non-parametric uncertainties.  The main technology used to  compensate for non-parametric uncertainties is recursive application of the adaptive bounding design.  15 Refs.

Title: Optimisation of attraction domains of nonlinear MPC via LMI methods
Abstract: This paper addresses the attraction domain of Model-Based Predictive  Control (MPC) for nonlinear systems with control input and state  constraints.  Based on a stability condition of nonlinear MPC, a  method to determine the terminal weighting term in the performance  index and the terminal stabilising control law to maximise the  domain of attraction of the nonlinear MPC is proposed.  The problem  of maximisation of the attraction region is recast as a well-defined optimisation problem.  By an LMI based optimisation approach, the  terminal weighting item and fictitious terminal stabilising control  law are optimised to enlarge the attraction domain and hence the  feasibility domain of the nonlinear MPC method.  The proposed method  is illustrated by a numerical example and favourably compared with  existing results.  14 Refs.

Title: Controlling chaotic oscillations in delay-differential systems via  peak-to-peak maps
Abstract: A method for controlling chaotic oscillations in delay-differential  systems is presented.  The method, which is intrinsically heuristic,  relies on the capability of predicting the peak (relative maximum)  of an output variable from the knowledge of the previous peak.  This  property, called peak-to-peak dynamics, is owned by several  finite-dimensional systems, and crucially relies on the  low-dimensionality of the chaotic attractor.  In this paper, it is  shown that even delay-differential systems may display peak-to-peak  dynamics, and the conditions giving rise to this property are  analyzed.  Then, a reduced model (a first-order map) derived via  peak-to-peak dynamics is exploited to suppress chaos in favor of a  periodic regime.  28 Refs.

Title: Adaptive robust control for a class of nonlinear systems with unknown uncertainties
Abstract: The problem of robust stabilization for nonlinear systems with  partially known uncertainties is considered in this paper.  The  required information about uncertainties in the system is merely  that the uncertainties are bounded, but the upper bounds are  incompletely known.  This paper can be viewed as an extension of the  work in reference [1] .  To compensate the  uncertainties, an adaptive robust controller based on Lyapunov  method is proposed and the design algorithm is also suggested.   Compared with some previous controllers which can only ensure  ultimate uniform boundedness of the systems, the controller given in the paper can make sure that the obtained closed-loop system is  asymptotically stable in the large.  Simulations show that the method presented is available and effective.  7 Refs.

Title: Guaranteed cost LPV output-feedback controller design for nonlinear  systems
Abstract: This paper proposes a guaranteed cost linear parameter-varying(LPV)  output-feedback controller for nonlinear systems.  Interpolating a  nonlinear system into an LPV system associated with time-varying and state-dependent weighting functions, i.e. the gain-scheduled  parameters, allows one to apply various linear system theories and  techniques for analyzing and synthesizing nonlinear systems.   Consequently, with the real-time measurable time-varying parameters, this paper presents an affine type of linear parameter-dependent  output-feedback controller, i.e. an LPV controller, for the given  LPV plant.  And as a cost, we shall consider an upper bound of states and input energy called LQ performance, under all admissible grades  of the gain-scheduled parameters.  This approach is more flexible for the nonlinear systems than existing approaches in the literature  because the other controllers excessively depend on the structure of the nonlinear systems.  13 Refs.

Title: Point-to-point control of elastic joint robots dynamic output  feedback passification approach
Abstract: Motivated by the dynamic output feedback passification results, a  point-to-point control law for an elastic joint robot is presented  when only the position measurements are available.  This provides an  alternative way of replacing the role of the velocity measurements  for the proportional-derivative (PD) feedback law.  The proposed  methodology makes a parallel connection of the robot system and an  input-dimensional linear system which obtains the effect of the  desired differentiators.  It is shown that the closed-loop nonlinear  robot system satisfies the sufficient conditions for passification  and the regulation as well as the passivity of the system is  achieved in the end.  The performance of the proposed control law is  illustrated in the simulation studies of a manipulator with three  revolute elastic joints.  26 Refs.

This method  allows to compute the time-optimal control for all possible parking  configurations (parallel, diagonal, row parking).  The experiments  show that using this method the movements for different complex  situations can be calculated in a timely fashion.  13 Refs.

Title: Hybrid control of formations of robots
Abstract: We describe a framework for controlling a group of nonholonomic  mobile robots equipped with range sensors.  The vehicles are required to follow a prescribed trajectory while maintaining a desired  formation.  By using the leader-following approach, we formulate the  formation control problem as a hybrid (mode switching) control  system.  We then develop a decision module that allows the robots to  automatically switch between continuous-state control laws to  achieve a desired formation shape.  The stability properties of the  closed-loop hybrid system are studied using Lyapunov theory.  We do  not use explicit communication between robots; instead we integrate  optimal estimation techniques with nonlinear controllers.  Simulation and experimental results verify the validity of our approach.  14  Refs.

Title: A fast path planning-and-tracking control for wheeled mobile robots
Abstract: This paper presents a fast method to plan the path, and control the  position of wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) in a robot soccer game.  In  a WMR system with position control, when the target position is  given, the controller will generate the reference path and then the  WMR will move to the target position following the reference path.   To tackle the difficulties of the nonlinear control problem, the  motion of the WMR is realized via changing the linear displacement  and angular displacement in a separate manner such that the WMR is  either rotating or moving in a straight line at any one time.  This  method takes advantage of a proposed fast path-planning algorithm.   The complexity of design is thus significantly reduced.  6 Refs.

Title: Transition to nonlinear h infinity optimal control from  inverse-optimal solution for Euler-Lagrange system
Abstract: One of recent achievements in the field of nonlinear H infinity  optimal control theories for Euler-Lagrange systems is the analytic  solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaccs (HJI) equation associated to  the so-called nonlinear H infinity inverse-optimal control left  bracket 1] .  In this paper, we address the problem of  nonlinear H infinity optimal control design for an Euler-Lagrange  system, rather than the inverse-optimal problem.  By introducing a  technique of control weight loosening and state weight  strengthening, we will show that the associated HJI inequality, not  the equation, for nonlinear H infinity optimal control can be solved also analytically using the inverse-optimal solution.  9 Refs.

Title: Robust nonlinear reduced-order dynamic controller design and its  application to a single-link manipulator
Abstract: In this paper, we concentrate on the design of robust reduced-order  dynamic feedback control for a class of nonlinear systems with  uncertainties.  A robust nonlinear reduced-order dynamic controller  (RNRDC) is proposed.  The resulting closed-loop system can be  robustly stabilized for all admissible uncertainties via the  proposed controller.  The application of the proposed RNRDC to a  permanent magnet brush dc (PMBDC) motor driving a single-link  manipulator is also considered.  The parameters uncertainties can be  up to plus or minus 80%.  The load can vary among the range -50% to  +100% of the nominal value.  Our simulation results show that for the example system the proposed RNRDC can achieve good performance.  10  Refs.

Title: Data interpretation and system identification in hydrodynamic model  testing
Abstract: A selected range of problems and solutions in hydrodynamic model  testing is discussed.  The work is limited mainly to the  interpretation of data from experiments in irregular waves.   Procedures within nonlinear data processing and the probabilistic  interpretation of test data are briefly reviewed, including  cross-bi-spectral analysis and the statistical analysis of extreme  values in a record.  Examples from application in various practical  cases are shown.  This includes the slow-drift analysis of moored  floating platforms, statistical analysis of long-duration laboratory records, as well as wave run-up on a vertical column in irregular  sea.  44 Refs.

Title: A new result of nonlinear mixed H//2/H// infinity tracking control  problem for robotic systems
Abstract: The design objective of a mixed H//2H// infinity control is to find  the H//2 optimal tracking control law under a prescribed disturbance attenuation level.  With the help of the technique of completing the  squares, a further result of the mixed H//2/H// infinity optimal  tracking control problem, is presented by combining with standard LQ optimal control technique.  In this paper, only a nonlinear  time-varying Riccati equation is required in the design procedure,  instead of two coupled nonlinear time-varying Riccati equations or  two coupled linear algebraic Riccati-like equations under some  assumptions regarding the weighting matrices.  Moreover, it shows  that the weighting matrices can be chosen arbitrarily with the  combination the result in this paper and in Chen and Chang's paper.   14 Refs.

Title: The neural network identification and control of nonlinear and great  time-delay system
Abstract: The nonlinear and great time-delay control systems were identified  using the approximating ability, adaptive ability and optimizing  ability of diagonal regressive neural network (DRNN).  The  identification unit (DRNI), the prediction unit (DRNP) and the  prediction control unit (DRNPC) were realized and experiments were  carried out on the servo of artillery.  The neural network predictive control unit was found to be trained by genetic algorithms.  The  systemic future output was forcasted based on the present and past  input/output data.  The prospective requirement was achieved by  optimizing the actual control and putting forward the structure and  principle of the neural network control system.  (Edited abstract) 2  Refs.

Title: Differential games and nonlinear H// infinity control in infinite  dimensions
Abstract: This paper studies the H// infinity control problem for a nonlinear,  unbounded, infinite dimensional system with state constraints.  We  characterize the solvability of the problem by means of a  Hamilton-Jacobi Isaacs (HJI) equation, proving that the H// infinity problem can be solved if and only if the HJI equation has a positive definite viscosity supersolution, vanishing and continuous at the  origin.  In order to do so, the standard definition of the H//  infinity problem has to be relaxed by using the theory of  differential games.  We apply our results to the one phase Stefan  problem.  33 Refs.

Title: Control of giant swing motion of a two-link horizontal bar gymnastic  robot
Abstract: We investigated a control method to realize the three different types of free giant swing motions produced by a two-link horizontal bar  gymnastic robot.  By evaluating the eigenvalues of the transitional  error matrix on the Poincare plane, it was found that the stable  giant swing motions could be obtained by a proposed configuration  control, in which the actuated joint torque is controlled such that  the measured state variables follow the reference configuration with respect to the angular position of the passive joint.  We also  demonstrated that the two types of stable giant swing motions could  be accomplished by the configuration method.  11 Refs.

Title: Stable adaptive fuzzy controller with time-varying dead-zone
Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive fuzzy control scheme for a class of  continuous-time nonlinear dynamic systems for which explicit linear  parameterizations of the uncertainties are either unknown or  impossible.  To improve robustness under the approximation errors and disturbances, the proposed scheme includes a dead-zone in adaptation laws which varies its size adaptively.  The assumption of known  bounds on the approximation errors and disturbances is not required  since those are estimated using adaptation laws.  The overall  adaptive scheme is proven to guarantee global uniform ultimate  boundedness in the Lyapunov sense. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.   15 Refs.

Title: Design of fuzzy controllers based on stability analysis
Abstract: Fuzzy systems have been successfully applied to the design of  knowledge-based controllers, yielding very good performance in many  cases.  However, one of the main drawbacks of fuzzy control has been  the lack of formal analysis and design techniques that allow the  designer to ensure a priori certain features of the closed-loop  system, particularly stability.  This article presents a systematic  procedure for the design of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controllers for  nonlinear plants in controllable canonical form.  Consequent  parameters are obtained using linearized plant models and linear  design techniques.  Premise parameters are computed in such a way  that the asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point in the  closed-loop system is guaranteed.  The proposed design method is  illustrated with two examples and simulation results. copy 2001  Elsevier Science B.V.  22 Refs.

Abstract: In the Shared Space project, we explore, innovate, design and  evaluate future computing environments that will radically enhance  interaction between human and computers as well as interaction  between humans mediated by computers.  In particular, we investigate  how augmented reality enhanced by physical and spatial 3D user  interfaces can be used to develop effective face-to-face  collaborative computing environments.  How will we interact in such  collaborative spaces? How will we interact with each other? What new applications can be developed using this technology? These are the  questions that we are trying to answer in research on Shared Space.   This paper provides a short overview of Shared Space, its  directions, technologies and applications.  15 Refs.

Title: A test bed for prototyping human/computer interfaces used in mission  critical environments
Abstract: A test bed is described that allows the simulation of multimedia  display interfaces as used in flight control and other environments  in which a human operator must quickly and accurately make  critically important decisions.  The test bed was designed to provide a flexible and robust means of creating test scenarios without the  need for re-developing the display interface system.  Through the use of the user-friendly Test Bed Configuration (TBC) sub-system, the  effectiveness of various combinations of graphics and audio can be  evaluated under realistic conditions.  The test bed was successfully  implemented and used in a human factors study undertaken at NASA's  Dryden Flight Research Center (Edwards, CA).  It is now available on  the Internet.  6 Refs.

Title: Automated lip synchronized speech driven facial animation
Abstract: Talking 3D synthetic faces are now used in many applications  involving human-computer interaction.  The lip synchronization of the faces are mostly done mechanically by computer animators.  Although  there is some work done on automated lip syncronized facial  animation, these studies are mostly based on text input.  In our  work, we use speech in Turkish as an input to generate lip  synchronized facial animation.  Speakers' recorded voice is converted into lip shape classes on the 3D model.  Voice is analyzed and  classified using a training set.  Lip animation is facilitated using  facial muscles and the jaw.  Facial muscles are modelled onto our  facial model.  For more realistic facial animation, facial tissue is  modelled as well, and the interactions between epidermis,  subcutenous layer and bone are taken into account.  Natural-looking  facial animation is achieved in realtime on a personal computer.  We  also show that our system is compatible with MPEG4.  20 Refs.

Title: Interactive artificial life based on behaviour and perception in a  virtual environment
Abstract: A cyber-character is a kind of artificial life inhabiting a virtual  world.  To be a life form in the virtual world, cyber characters need sensors and control systems.  The sensor system enables the cyber  character to recognize not only the virtual world but also the real  world in such a manner that it can respond to user's commands.  The  control system provides the cyber character with life-like behaviour by generating goals and plans, selecting appropriate actions, and  finally by animating the character.  Users may feel the cyber  character to be alive because of its close interaction and smart  performance.  In this paper, a cyber-character system designed to  provide users with a realistic feeling of an artificial life is  discussed.  9 Refs.

Title: New turbomachinery unit control concept
Abstract: Certain process control applications, such as compressor/turbine  control, require unit control capabilities with advanced algorithms  and sequential/logic control.  At one time, this could only be  achieved using specialized high-speed controllers or PLCs with  custom intercommunication.  Advanced control was not included and  external connectivity was limited.  With the advent of a new unit  controller architecture, control system designers and users can  choose a single stand-alone controller to provide cost-effective  solutions to rotating equipment unit control system needs.  This unit controller includes advanced control/optimization, modular  redundancy a full-featured PPC-based graphic HMI and open  communications.  The paper describes how the new unit controller  integrates advanced control technology with high-performance  visualization and connectivity for wide access via Ethernet and  Internet.  It also addresses the specific benefits of this new  concept.

Title: 2D to pseudo-3D conversion of "head and shoulder" images using  feature based parametric disparity maps
Abstract: This paper presents a method of converting a 2D still photo  containing the head & shoulders of a human (e.g. a passport photo)  to pseudo-3D, so that the depth can be perceived via stereopsis.   This technology has the potential to be included in self-serve photo booths and, also as an added accessory (i.e. software package) for  digital still cameras and scanners.  The basis of the algorithm is to exploit the ability of the human visual system in combining  monoscopic and stereoscopic cues for depth perception.  Common facial features are extracted from the 2D photograph, in order to create a  parametric depth map that conforms to the available monoscopic depth cues.  The original 2D photograph and the created depth map are used  to generate left and right views for stereoscopic viewing.  The  algorithm is implemented in software, and promising results are  obtained.  6 Refs.

Title: 3D tracking of multi-objects using color and stereo for HCI
Abstract: We present a 3D tracking method of multi-object by color and stereo.   And we applied the results to the navigation and manipulation in  virtual environment.  We chose a human face and hands as tracking  targets for HCI.  To extract the area of face and hands in the  complex background, we transformed an input color image using the  GSCD.  Based on the transformed image, we detected the area of face  and hands by WUPC.  Furthermore, the face and hands candidate region  are estimated by Kalman filter in the following frame.  And then we  could extract the depth information about the only corresponding  region, respectively, by stereo matching.  Finally, we could navigate and manipulate of objects based on extracted 3D information of face  and hands naturally in virtual environment without any additional  device.  8 Refs.

Title: Region growing based on extended gradient vector flow field model for multiple objects segmentation
Abstract: For image segmentation, traditional snake algorithms are often short  of the requirement of human interaction and capability in processing multiple objects simultaneously.  Watershed techniques however have  the drawback of over-segmentation.  A new region growing algorithm  based on the extended gradient vector flow (E-GVF) field model is  proposed in this paper of multiple objects segmentation.  The  proposed force field propagates gradient information of object  boundaries and provides a good feature for region growing.  We  perform scoring and selection of seeds by considering their local  gradient direction information.  This step is automatic and requires  no human interaction, making our algorithm much suitable for  applications.  Experiments show that our algorithm is noise-resistant and also resolves the above-mentioned drawbacks for snakes and  watershed methods.  We have tested our algorithm in segmenting  multiple objects from realistic and even medical CT images and  gained good results.  9 Refs.

Title: Empirical evaluation of layered video coding schemes
Abstract: Video coding for Internet applications faces major challenges.  Due to the heterogeneity of the network, users with very different access  bandwidths to the Internet want to receive videos of the best  possible quality.  A good coding scheme for layered video pursues the following major goal: it maximises the subjective visual quality at  a given bandwidth.  In this article, we present four different  techniques for video layering.  The work focuses on an evaluation  carried out on 30 test probands.  The objective was twofold: finding  both a suitable metric for automatic video quality assessment, as  well as the best layering technique.  The experimental results lead  us to pronounce recommendations on the metric for automatic video  quality assessment, and on a best video layering technique with  regard to human perception.  10 Refs.

Title: Somatotopy of the motor cortex after long-term spinal cord injury or  amputation
Abstract: Certain brain-computer interface (BCI) methods use intrinsic signals  from the motor cortex to control neuroprosthetic devices.  The  organization of the motor pathways in those populations likely to  use neuroprosthetic devices, therefore, needs to be determined;  there is evidence that following disease or injury the  representation of the body in the motor cortex may change.  In this  study, functional MRI measures of somatotopy following spinal cord  injury (SCI) showed evidence of changes in limb representations in  the motor cortex.  Subjects with chronic SCI had unusual cortical  patterns of activity when attempting to move limbs below their  injury; amputees showed a more normal somatotopy.  The functional  reorganization may affect optimal implanted electrode placements for invasive BCI methods for these different populations.  30 Refs.

Title: WordsEye: An automatic text-to-scene conversion system
Abstract: Natural language is an easy and effective medium for describing  visual ideas and mental images.  Thus, we foresee the emergence of  language-based 3D scene generation systems to let ordinary users  quickly create 3D scenes without having to learn special software,  acquire artistic skills, or even touch a desktop window-oriented  interface.  WordsEye is such a system for automatically converting  text into representative 3D scenes.  WordsEye relies on a large  database of 3D models and poses to depict entities and actions.   Every 3D model can have associated shape displacements, spatial  tags, and functional properties to be used in the depiction process.  We describe the linguistic analysis and depiction techniques used by WordsEye along with some general strategies by which more abstract  concepts are made depictable.  25 Refs.

Title: DAB: Interactive haptic painting with 3D virtual brushes
Abstract: We present a novel painting system with an intuitive haptic  interface, which serves as an expressive vehicle for interactively  creating painterly works.  We introduce a deformable, 3D brush model, which gives the user natural control of complex brush strokes.  The  force feedback enhances the sense of realism and provides tactile  cues that enable the user to better manipulate the paint brush.  We  have also developed a bidirectional, two-layer paint model that,  combined with a palette interface, enables easy loading of complex  blends onto our 3D virtual brushes to generate interesting paint  effects on the canvas.  The resulting system, DAB, provides the user  with an artistic setting, which is conceptually equivalent to a  real-world painting environment.  Several users have tested DAB and  were able to start creating original art work within minutes.  21  Refs.

Title: A case study in systematic hypermedia design
Abstract: Hypermedia structuring and navigation requires design methodologies  different from those developed for standard information systems.   This case study details our successful application of relationship  management methodology (RMM), a hypermedia systems analysis and  design methodology, to ACM SIGLINK's LINKBase.  LINKBase is a World  Wide Web (WWW) application, which dynamically generates WWW pages  from a relational database containing information about  hypermedia-related events such as conferences, publications,  authors, and sponsoring organizations.  We describe our experience  applying RMM in this case study, summarize design lessons we learned in the process, present extensions to RMM, discuss human-computer  interaction (HCI) aspects of RMM, and ground our work in the  hypermedia design and HCI literature.  Our experiences should  encourage hypermedia and WWW developers to utilize systematic design techniques to build highly usable and useful WWW applications.  57  Refs.

Title: Real-time visual system for interaction with a humanoid robot
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a new real-time visual system that enables a humanoid robot to learn from and interact with humans.  The core of the visual system is a probabilistic tracker that uses shape and  color information to find relevant objects in the scene.  Multiscale  representations, windowing and masking are employed to accelerate  the data processing.  The perception system is directly coupled with  the motor control system of our humanoid robot DB.  We present two  case studies of on-line interaction with a humanoid robot: mimicking of human hand motion and smooth pursuit of human head motion.  The  generation of humanoid robot motion based on the position of  relevant body parts is accomplished in real time.  Both studies are  supported by experimental results on DB. copy 2001 Elsevier Science  B.V.  All rights reserved.  16 Refs.

Title: Using wireless inter-PANs to enable seamless ongoing interaction  across mobile meetings and dispersed settings
Abstract: This article presents results of a research project aimed at  developing novel meeting support for mobile work domains.  The system developed, called RoamWare, supports seamless ongoing interaction  across collocated mobile face-to-face meetings and dispersed work  settings by use of wireless inter-PANs.  An inter-PAN is an ad hoc  setup of several mobile devices belonging to different users.  This  article describes the design requirements for RoamWare, and how  these have been realized in a working prototype system.  RoamWare  contributes to the fields of human-computer interaction and  computer-supported cooperative work by illustrating how session  management models can be modified to incorporate spontaneous mobile  meetings into one ongoing session of interaction.  23 Refs.

Title: Evaluating humanoid synthetic agents in e-retail applications
Abstract: This paper presents three experiments designed to empirically  evaluate humanoid synthetic agents in electronic retail  applications.  Firstly, human-like agents were evaluated in a single  e-retail application, a home furnishings service.  The second  experiment explored application dependency effects by evaluating the same human-like agents in a different e-retail application, a  personalized CD service.  The third experiment evaluated the  effectiveness of a range of humanoid cartoon-like agents.   Participants eavesdropped on spoken dialogues between a "customer"  and each of the agents, which played the role of conversational  sales assistants.  Results showed participants expected a high level  of realistic human-like verbal and nonverbal communicative behavior  from the human-like agents.  Overall ratings of the agents showed no  significant application dependency: Two different groups of  participants rated the human-like agents in similar ways in a  different application.  Further results showed participants have a  preference for three-dimensional (3-D) rather than two-dimensional  (2-D) cartoon-like agents and have a desire to interact with fully  embodied agents.  28 Refs.

Title: Precise onset detection of human motor responses using a whitening  filter and the log-likelihood-ratio test
Abstract: Investigation of the human motor system frequently requires precise  determination of the motor response onset indicating the time of  movement initiation (e.g., in reaction time experiments).  This paper presents a new model-based algorithm for computerized response onset detection in kinematic signals (e.g., joint angle).  The response  onset is identified as an abrupt change in the (time-varying)  parameters of a statistical process model adapted to the measured  signal.  The accuracy of the algorithm is assessed by statistical  simulations, and the performance of the method is compared to the  performance of conventional onset detection methods using simulated  as well as real kinematic signals.  Results show that onset detection can substantially be improved by including a priori knowledge on the physiological background of the measured signals to the decision  process.  42 Refs.

Title: A simple strategy for calibrating the geometry of light sources
Abstract: We present a methodology for calibrating multiple light source  locations in 3D from images.  The procedure involves the use of a  novel calibration object that consists of three spheres at known  relative positions.  The process uses intensity images to find the  positions of the light sources.  We conducted experiments to locate  light sources in 51 different positions in a laboratory setting.  Our data shows that the vector from a point in the scene to a light  source can be measured to within 2.7 plus or minus 4 degree at alpha = .05 (6 percent relative) of its true direction and within 0.13  plus or minus 02 m at alpha = .05 (9 percent relative) of its true  magnitude compared to empirically measured ground truth.  Finally, we demonstrate how light source information is used for color  correction.  21 Refs.

Title: The role of a natural language conversational interface in online  sales: A case study
Abstract: This paper describes the evaluation of a natural language  dialog-based navigation system (HappyAssistant) that helps users  access e-commerce sites to find relevant information about products  and services.  The prototype system leverages technologies in natural language processing and human-computer interaction to create a  faster and more intuitive way of interacting with websites,  especially for less experienced users.  The result of a comparative  study shows that users prefer the natural language-enabled  navigation two to one over the menu driven navigation.  In addition,  the study confirmed the efficiency of using natural language dialog  in terms of the number of clicks and the amount of time required to  obtain the relevant information.  In the case study, as compared to  the menu driven system, the average number of clicks used in the  natural language system was reduced by 63.2% and the average time  was reduced by 33.3%.  15 Refs.

Then, the available CR techniques with their superiorities and  weaknesses are reviewed.  Finally, the current status of CR is  discussed, and directions for future research are suggested.  Special attention is given to the off-line handwriting recognition since  this area requires more research to reach the ultimate goal of  machine simulation of human reading.  192 Refs.

Title: Building HAL: Computers that sense, recognize, and respond to human  emotion
Abstract: The HAL 9000 computer, the inimitable star of the classic Kubrick and Clarke film "2001: A Space Odyssey," displayed image understanding  capabilities vastly beyond today's computer systems.  HAL could not  only instantly recognize who he was interacting with, but also he  could lip read, judge aesthetics of visual sketches, recognize  emotions subtly expressed by scientists on board the ship, and  respond to these emotions in an adaptive personalized way.  Of  course, HAL also had capabilities that we might not want to give to  machines, like the ability to terminate life support or otherwise  take lives of people.  This presentation highlights recent research  in giving machines certain affective abilities that aim to make them more intelligent, shows examples of some of these systems, and  describes the role that affective abilities may play in future  human-computer interaction.  24 Refs.

Title: Transforming the 'weakest link' - A human/computer interaction  approach to usable and effective security
Abstract: The security research community has recently recognised that user  behaviour plays a part in many security failures, and it has become  common to refer to users as the 'weakest link in the security,  chain'.  We argue that simply blaming users will not lead to more  effective security systems.  Security designers must identify the  causes of undesirable user behaviour, and address these to design  effective security systems.  We present examples of how undesirable  user behaviour with passwords can be caused by failure to recognise  the characteristics of human memory, unattainable or conflicting  task demands, and lack of support, training and motivation.  We  conclude that existing human/computer interaction knowledge and  techniques can be used to prevent or address these problems, and  outline a vision of a holistic design approach for usable and  effective security.  24 Refs.

Title: Application of theory: Minimalism and user centered design
Abstract: In the discipline of software and information development, minimalist design is not just doing with less (less features, words, widgets).   It is selectively choosing what to include or eliminate with the  purpose of making it easier for the user to quickly learn about a  product in a natural and painless way and to start using it to do  real work.  User centered design fits well with minimalist theory  because it incorporates user feedback throughout the development  cycle.  It is the best way to find out what customers actually do  with your product and leant first-hand how you can help them with  their goals.  My team applied both these theories to our task of  designing and building a set of samples for a Web development  product.  This paper shares our struggles and successes.  14 Refs.

Title: Effects of task-modality fit on user performance
Abstract: Research on visual and auditory modalities in human-computer  interfaces has been aimed at making the interface similar to the  process through which people naturally acquire information.  The  objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of visual,  auditory, and multi-modalities for representing information in  different problem domains.  The results of this study indicate that  visual and auditory modalities were effective in different problem  domains.  Visual modality was generally appropriate for representing  static events, while auditory modality was appropriate for the  representation of changing events.  Multi-modality interfaces led to  significantly better performance than either an auditory or a visual modality in a high-attention task.  No statistically significant  differences were observed for the low-attention task. copy 2001  Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  26 Refs.

Title: The effect of extrinsic motivation on user behavior in a  collaborative information finding system
Abstract: In collaborative information finding systems, evaluations provided by users assist other users with similar needs.  This article examines  the problem of getting users to provide evaluations, thus overcoming the so-called "free-riding" behavior of users.  Free riders are those who use the information provided by others without contributing  evaluations of their own.  This article reports on an experiment  conducted using the "AntWorld," system, a collaborative information  finding system for the Internet, to explore the effect of added  motivation on users' behavior.  The findings suggest that for the  system to be effective, users must be motivated either by the  environment, or by incentives within the system.  The findings  suggest that relatively inexpensive extrinsic motivators can produce modest but significant increases in cooperative behavior.  25 Refs.

Abstract: Current force feedback, haptic interface devices are generally  limited to the display of low frequency, high amplitude spatial  data.

The movement of the device is then constrained  using high gain positional feedback, thus reducing the apparent dof  of the device and conveying the illusion of hard contact to the  user.  Such devices are, however, limited to a narrow bandwidth of  frequencies, typically below 30 Hz, and are not well suited to the  display of surface properties, such as object texture.  This paper  details a device to augment an existing force feedback haptic  display with a vibrotactile display, thus providing a means of  conveying low amplitude, high frequency spatial information of  object surface properties.

Title: Towards an integrating programme for information systems design: An  Oriental case
Abstract: The field of information systems design (ISD) is in a state of  fragmentation; further, it has proved not easy to integrate  embracing ontology and pluralist epistemology into user-friendly  methodologies able to facilitate disciplinary and creative ISD  actions.  These difficulties are addressed via an Oriental approach,  WSR (relations with the world, the mind and others), which draws  upon ancient Chinese thought and contemporary management practice in China.  WSR has been used to help IS developers and users in viewing  ISD as a technical-cognitive-social whole, shaping ISD as an  issue-task matrix, guiding ISD as a spiral learning and  bubble-management process, enhancing participation by transforming  management-ISD methodologies, and identifying further research  areas.  It is suggested that ISD will benefit from conscious mutual  learning between the Western spirit of critical rigour and the  Eastern flexible pragmatic mindset.  (Author abstract) 44 Refs.

Title: Application of an aesthetic evaluation model to data entry screens
Abstract: A screen often has to present information clearly and also act as the locus for interacting with the system.  This is a complex area,  involving some psychological understanding, as well as aspects of  graphical design.  Although knowledge of the users' tasks and  abilities is the key to designing effective screen displays, an  objective, automatable metric of screen design is an essential aid.   In this paper, we describe a new model for quantitatively assessing  screen formats.  The results of applying the model to data entry  screens support the use of the model.  We also describe a critiquing  mechanism embedded in a user interface design environment as a  demonstration of our approach.  (Author abstract) 17 Refs.

Title: Cognitive-behavioral model of pathological Internet use
Abstract: This article introduces a cognitive-behavioral model of Pathological  Internet Use (PIU).  While previous studies on Internet addiction  have described behavioral factors, such as withdrawal and tolerance, the present article focuses on the maladaptive cognitions associated with PIU.  The cognitive-behavioral model of PIU distinguishes  between specific PIU and generalized PIU.  Specific PIU refers to the condition in which an individual pathologically uses the Internet  for a particular purpose, such as online sex or online gambling,  whereas generalized PIU describes a more global set of behaviors.   The model implies a more important role of cognitions in PIU, and  describes the means by which PIU is both developed and maintained.   Furthermore, it provides a framework for the development of  cognitive-behavioral interventions for PIU.  (Author abstract) 11  Refs.

Title: Love on the Internet: Involvement and misrepresentation in romantic  relationships in cyberspace vs. realspace
Abstract: This study compares reported romantic relationships of chat room  users in cyberspace vs. in face-to-face relationships in everyday  contexts ( realspace').  As hypothesized, involvement - particularly  commitment and seriousness - tended to be lower in cyberspace than  in realspace romantic relationships, and misrepresentation -  specifically of age and physical attributes - tended to be higher in cyberspace than in realspace relationships.  A causal analysis  indicated that space affected level of involvement which in turn  affected amount of misrepresentation.  Cyberspace respondents were  older than realspace respondents.  Few differences were evident for  gender or education.  Possibilities for future research regarding  romantic relationships and cyberspace are briefly discussed.  (Author abstract) 33 Refs.

Title: Study of uncertainties in modeling antenna performance and power  absorption in the head of a cellular phone user
Abstract: A set of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) numerical experiments  modeling canonical representations of the human head/cellular phone  interaction has been performed in order to investigate the effect of specific simulation details (e.g., antenna numerical representation  and absorbing boundary conditions) on computed results.  Furthermore, hybrid techniques based on the dyadic Green's function and the  method of auxiliary sources, and on a hybrid method-of-moments-FDTD  technique have been used to compute parameters of interest for  comparison with the FDTD evaluated parameters.  It was found that  small, but potentially significant, differences in computed results  could occur, even between groups that were nominally using a very  similar method.  However, these differences could be made to become  very small when precise details of the simulation were harmonized,  particularly in the regions close to the source point.

Title: Man-machine collaborative work based on visual communication
Abstract: A new concept of a multi-agent system is proposed in this paper in  which, not only the entities equipped with actuators, but also  static objects take the role of agents by recognizing their own  situations and broadcasting their requests.  It is expected that in  future a computer will be manufactured in the form of a smaller and  thinner entity like a bar code film with some sensors.  This style of computer will be attached to every industrial product, which may  result in such static agents as proposed in the present paper.  A  case study is described which shows a man-machine visual  communication system for those who need help to take things such as  aged or handicapped people.  Roles of static object agents in the  system are shown and their significance is discussed as well as the  performance of the entire system.  (Author abstract) 5 Refs.

Title: Distributed collaborative environments for the 21**s**t century  laboratory
Abstract: Distributed collaboration is an emerging technology that will  significantly change how business and research is conducted in  21**s**t century.  As downsizing trends continue in both government  and industry, organizations increasingly require more efficient,  effective collaboration and knowledge sharing for geographically  dispersed personnel across multiple application domains in order to  solve complex problems and accomplish difficult tasks.  Past research has treated knowledge sharing as an information technology problem  and has ignored an organization's culture and related process  changes needed for successful collaboration.  This paper reviews the  application of distributed collaborative environments employing an  agent-based framework with emphasis on product and process modeling  to enable information and knowledge sharing for Air Force  acquisition and technology development.  This research is a  significant benchmark in the evolution of collaboration in that  information technology, process change, and the sociology of human  interaction are woven into a fabric of knowledge sharing - the  knowledge focused organization.  9 Refs.

Title: On the implementation of ASR algorithms for hand-held wireless mobile devices
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the implementation of automatic speech  recognition (ASR) based services on wireless mobile devices.   Techniques are investigated for improving the performance of ASR  systems in the context of the devices themselves, the environments  that they are used in, and the networks they are connected to.  A set of ASR tasks and ASR system architectures that are applicable to a  wide range of simple mobile devices is presented.  A prototype ASR  based service is defined and the implementation of the service on a  wireless mobile device is described.  A database of speech utterances was collected from a population of fifty users interacting with this prototype service in multiple environments.  An experimental study  was performed where model compensation procedures for improving  acoustic robustness and lattice rescoring procedures for reducing  task perplexity were evaluated on this speech corpus.  9 Refs.

Title: Explaining updates by minimal sums
Abstract: Human reasoning about developments of the world involves always an  assumption of inertia.  We discuss two approaches for formalizing  such an assumption, based on the concept of an explanation: (1)  there is a general preference relation (has lower rank than sign)  given on the set of all explanations and (2) there is a notion of a  distance between models and explanations are preferred if their sum  of distances is minimal.  Each distance dist naturally induces a  preference relation (has lower rank than sign)//d//i//s//t.  We show  exactly under which conditions the converse is true as well and  therefore both approaches are equivalent modulo these conditions.   Our main result is a general representation theorem in the spirit of Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All  rights reserved.  18 Refs.

Title: Human-robot cooperative handling using virtual nonholonomic  constraint in 3-D space
Abstract: This paper deals with human-robot cooperative handling of a long  object in 3-D space.  We assume that the operator and the robot grasp each end of the object and carry it cooperatively.  In this task, it  is difficult for the human operator to apply a large torque to give  a translational force at the robot hand.  Thus, we propose to assign  a virtual nonholonomic contstraint to the robot hand.  In this  method, the robot behaves like a unicycle and we only use  translational force to manipulate it.  The controllability is assured based on nonholonomy and the operator can transport the object to  the desired position and posture in 3-D space by a similar skill  using a wheelbarrow.  The effectiveness of our method is  experimentally verified.  11 Refs.

Title: Adaptive annotation using a human-robot interface system PARTNER
Abstract: We are developing a human-robot interface system, PARTNER, that takes into account the flexibility of the Augmented Reality approach.  The  prototype consists of a projector subsystem for information display  and a real-time tracking vision subsystem to recognize the  environment and the human's action.  For teaching robot tasks, three  kinds of interaction have been developed: Virtual Operational Panel, Interactive Image Panel, and Interactive Hand Pointer.  This paper  presents the fourth function, Adaptive Annotation Function (AAF) for teaching and assisting the human's task.  Based on a state transition diagram, the system generates annotations adaptively to the  situation by monitoring not only changes of the object's geometry  but also the operator's action required for achieving the task.  To  detect changes of the environment, we have implemented structured  light rangefinder capabilities using components of the prototype  system.  Experimental results of an unfolding task of a portable OHP  device demonstrate th e usefulness of the proposed system.  12 Refs.

Title: Psychological analysis on human-robot interaction
Abstract: For realizing a robot working in human society, interaction with  humans is the key issue.  We have developed a robot that interacts  with humans based on visual recognition.  This robot has two vision  systems: an omnidirectional vision system for acquiring necessary  visual information and a binocular stereo vision system.  The  binocular vision system indicates what the robot is looking at and  is not used for locomotion.  Gaze control plays an important role in  human-robot interaction.  This paper reports how the robot's gaze  influences subjects' impressions of the robot.  With a statistically  significant number of robot observers, we employed psychological  methods, the semantic differential method (SD), and factor analysis.  This careful psychological analysis of robot impressions is the  first trial in robotics.  Through the experiment, we have found that  the impressions mainly consist of four factors: familiarity,  enjoyment, activity, and performance.  The computer skills of  subjects affect their impressions of t he robot.  9 Refs.

Title: Self-tuning position and force control of an underwater hydraulic  manipulator
Abstract: Current generation unmanned underwater vehicles, equipped with  robotic manipulators, are teleoperated and consequently place a  large workload burden on the human operator.  A greater degree of  automation could improve the efficiency and accuracy with which  underwater tasks are carried out.  These tasks can involve  manipulator motion that is both unconstrained and/or constrained.   For unconstrained motion, where a trajectory requires following, a  prerequisite is good joint angle control.  An adaptive self-tuning  pole-placement controller is used for joint angle control.  Practical results show the benefits compared to conventional fixed-gain  control.  For constrained motion, often simultaneous control of  position and force is required.  An adaptive hybrid position/force  controller is proposed and compared to a fixed-gain version.   Simulation and practical results illustrate the merits and drawbacks of each scheme.  6 Refs.

Within this paper, the lines and  methodologies followed within the design of the complete functional  and algorithmic control architecture for the workcell will be  presented in some details, by mainly focusing on its various aspects of modularity, scalability and composability, which presently allow  the execution of many different, cooperative, object manipulation  tasks.  14 Refs.

Title: General danger-evaluation method of human-care robot control and  development of special simulator
Abstract: This paper proposes safety evaluation method for use in various kinds of control strategies for human-care robots.  In the case of a  careless collision between a robot and a human, impact force and  impact stress are chosen as evaluation measures, and a danger-index  is defined to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of each  safety strategy used for control.  As in the previous paper on safety design, this proposed method allows us to assess the contribution of each safety control strategy to the overall safety performance of a  human-care robot.  In addition, new type of 3-D robot simulation  system for danger-evaluation is constructed on PC.  The system  simplifies to evaluate danger about both design and control of  various kind of human-care robots to quantify the effectiveness of  various safety strategies.  4 Refs.

Title: Generating linguistic spatial descriptions from sonar readings using  the histogram of forces
Abstract: In this paper, we show how linguistic expressions can be generated to describe the spatial relations between a mobile robot and its  environment, using readings from a ring of sonar sensors.  Our work  is motivated by the study of human-robot communication for  non-expert users.  The eventual goal is to use these linguistic  expressions for navigation of the mobile robot in an unknown  environment, where the expressions represent the qualitative state  of the robot with respect to its environment, in terms that are  easily understood by human users.  In the paper, we describe the  histogram of forces and its application to sonar sensors on a mobile robot.  Several environment examples are also included with the  generated linguistic descriptions.  14 Refs.

Title: Human interface for maneuvering nonholonomic systems
Abstract: Humans can easily maneuver some types of nonholonomic systems, e.g.   wheeled vehicles, while other types, e.g. space robots, are  difficult to handle intuitively.  We propose a human interface to  simplify the operation of "difficult" nonholonomic systems, which  utilizes the human ability to maneuver "easy" systems.  The difficult real system is converted into an easy virtual system using  coordinate and input transformation.  The input from the human  operator to the virtual system is converted into input to the real  system, while the state of the real system is converted into that of the virtual system which is displayed to the operator.  The operator  can then steer the real system feeling as if maneuvering the virtual system.  Our experiments show that the operating performance is  improved by this method.  12 Refs.

Title: Proposal of an adaptive vision-based attentive tracker for human  intended actions
Abstract: Recent advances in vision technology lead to the establishment of  non-verbal communication channels from human behaviors toward  understanding their intention.  An Adaptive Vision-based Attentive  Tracker (AVAT) is proposed for isolating such human intended actions from the ordinary walking behavior.  The algorithm which drives the  attentive tracker is divided into two sub-processes: one is for  modeling the movement of human body parts as the environment using  HMMs (Hidden Markov Models), and the other is for learning the model of the tracker's action using a TD algorithm (Temporal Difference  Algorithm).  In the paper, we describe in detail the integration of  the two sub-processes and finally show an experimental result of  isolating the human sign action during his natural walking motion  for demonstrating the feasibility of our proposal.  Identification of the sign context determines the action of the tracker with the  simulated rewards supplied.  14 Refs.

Title: An efficient genetic algorithm with less fitness evaluation by  clustering
Abstract: To solve a general problem with genetic algorithm, it is desirable to maintain the population size as large as possible, in some cases,  however, the cost to evaluate each individual is relatively high,  and it is difficult to maintain large population.  To solve this  problem we propose a hybrid GA based on clustering, which  considerably reduces evaluation number without any loss of its  performance.  The algorithm divides the whole population into several clusters, and evaluates only one representative for each cluster.   The fitness values of other individuals are estimated from the  representative fitness values indirectly, which can maintain large  population with less number of evaluations.  Several benchmark tests  have been conducted and the results show that the proposed GA is  very efficient.  14 Refs.

Title: Model and application of a binaural 360 degree sound localization  system
Abstract: We introduce a biologically inspired sound localization system, based on an open two-microphone configuration.  Its purpose is to perform a robust, 360-degree detection of objects, in particular humans, in  the horizontal plane.  In our approach, we consider  neurophysiological findings to discuss the biological plausibility  of the coding and extraction of spatial features, but also meet the  demands and constraints of a practical application in the field of  human-robot interaction.  We are processing Interaural Time  Differences for the left/right detection and spectrum-based features to discriminate between in front and behind.  Tests in real  environments are used to demonstrate the function and the  application of the system.  We will briefly touch the point of  handling different acoustic room characteristics and give reasons  why the proposed model can show advantages over conventional  correlation methods.  14 Refs.

Title: A systematic approach for the design of post-transaction input error  handling
Abstract: Most of the errors that occur in the input of a program cannot be  automatically detected through input validation.  As a result, most  of such errors made in the input of a database transaction are  discovered only after the completion of the transaction.  Therefore,  the provision of error correction transactions for correcting such  error is essential in any database application.  Current system  development methodologies do not provide much detail for this  important design task.  The task is left to the designer's experience to carry out in an ad hoc way.  This paper formalizes the common  design knowledge in designing these transactions.  It proposes a  novel approach for the systematic design of post-transaction input  error handling in a database application. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  11 Refs.

Title: Man-machine interface using steering wheel and pedals for a quadruped walking robot
Abstract: For an easier and natural teleoperation of the quadruped walking  robots, a user interface is developed with a steering wheel and an  assembly of pedals, In order to change the speed and the direction  of the quadruped walking robots according to the operation of the  steering wheel and the pedals, an on-line gait transition method is  developed.  Using this human-machine interface and on-line gait  transition, the operator can control the quadruped walking robots  almost in the same way as a driver drives a car.  A quadruped walking robot named JROB-2 is used in the experiments.  As the steering wheel is also equipped with various control buttons, it is possible to  assign various single command tasks, like "stand up" and "sit down"  etc., to these buttons and hence control the robot for these tasks  without even touching the keyboard or mouse.  This paper presents the details of this interface.  5 Refs.

Title: A service robot for peopled environments - Finding lined people by  stereo vision and standing in line
Abstract: Recent research results on mobile robot navigation systems make it  promising to utilize them in service fields.  But in order to utilize the robot in a peopled environment, it should recognize and respond  to people's social behaviors.  In this paper, we describe a social  robot that stands in line as people do.  Our system uses the concept  of personal space for modeling a line of people and we have  experimentally measured the actual size of the personal space when  people form lines.  The system employs stereo vision to recognize  lines of people.  We demonstrate our ideas with a mobile robot  navigation system that can purchase a cup of coffee, even if people  are waiting in line for service.  11 Refs.

Abstract: This paper describes research on mental commit robot that seeks a  different direction that is not so rigidly dependent on such  objective measures as accuracy, speed, and cost.  The main goal of  this research is to explore a new area in robotics, with an emphasis on human-robot interaction.  In the previous research, we categorized robots into four categories in terms of appearance.  Then, we  introduced a cat robot and a seal robot, and evaluated them by  interviewing many people.  The results showed that physical  interaction improved subjective evaluation.  Moreover, a priori  knowledge of a subject has much influence into subjective  interpretation and evaluation of robot.  In this paper, 785 subjects  evaluated the seal robot and the results were analyzed by  multivariate analysis.  In addition, we applied mental commit robot  to therapy of children like as animal assisted therapy.  This paper  describes some results of "robot assisted therapyo".  11 Refs.

Abstract: A new service robot designed for cleaning tasks in home environments  is introduced.  Robot systems will work directly with people in these areas, thus placing a central importance on making interactions  between people and machines as natural as possible.  The main focus  of this paper is twofold: First, an introduction to the system's  design and to an intuitive programming approach which allows the  robot to be easily used by non-experts is given.  The approach is  based on human gesture recognition and context sensitive  interpretation.  Second, in order to transform full coverage paths  planned in workspace to paths in the robot's configuration space, a  closed form solution of the robot's inverse kinematics is derived.   The reduncancy of the manipulator is therein used to optimize the  inverse kinematics solution in terms of manipulability and closer  posture.  16 Refs.

Title: Real-time tracking of highly articulated structures in the presence  of noisy measurements
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for model-based real-time  tracking of highly articulated structures such as humans.  This  approach is based on an algorithm which efficiently propagates  statistics of probability distributions through a kinematic chain to obtain maximum a posteriori estimates of the motion of the entire  structure.  This algorithm yields the least squares solution in  linear time (in the number of components of the model) and can also  be applied to non-Gaussian statistics using a simple but powerful  trick.  The resulting implementation runs in real-time on standard  hardware without any pre-processing of the video data and can thus  operate on live video.  Results from experiments performed using this system are presented and discussed.  17 Refs.

Title: Coupled chaotic dynamical system and the solution for gambling game  problems
Abstract: Coupled dynamical system is made up of several interactive dynamic  systems, the coupling strengths of which are decided by the system  coupling parameters.  Recent researches have shown some powerful  capability of this kind of dynamical system in some engineering  fields [1] .  Gambling games are usually  considered as result-stochastic activities.  In this paper, we use  the discrete sampling time series of the attractor in Lorenz chaotic dynamical system to model a simple hammer-forfex-cloth gambling  game.  A coupled chaotic dynamic system is set up to model the  gambling game between "man" and "machine".  Through a great deal of  trial and error, we find the proper parameters for the machine  system, which can win over man at a large statistical advantage.   Theories and experiment results indicate that the coupled chaotic  dynamical system is a good solution of the so-called man-machine  gaming problem.  6 Refs.

Title: Ecological interface design for petrochemical applications:  Supporting operator adaptation, continuous learning, and  distributed, collaborative work
Abstract: Future support systems for operators of petrochemical refineries will have to support operator adaptation to unanticipated events, foster  continuous learning, and facilitate distributed, collaborative work.  This paper describes Ecological Interface Design, a candidate  framework for human-computer interface design that has the potential to fulfill these diverse demands.  Support for adaptation and  continuous learning is demonstrated though the design of a novel  operator interface for a fluid catalytic cracking unit.  While the  framework forms a basis upon which a distributed, collaborative  support system may be built, no such design is presented here.  The  process of the application of the framework is described in detail,  including the domain modelling activity and a description of the  resulting graphical user interface.  Limitations to applying the  design approach to operational plants are discussed. copy 2001  Elsevier Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  36 Refs.

Title: Building language communication between deaf people and hearing  society through multimodal human-computer interface
Abstract: The issue of building language communication between deaf people and  hearing society using multimodal human computer interface was  discussed.  To bridge the deaf people with normal hearing society,  the auto-translation agents which consisted of sign language  recognition, hand gesture synthesis, lip reading, feature detection  and face animation were investigated.  In this paper, some aspects of sign language recognition and synthesis were proposed.  Data-glove  was used for sign language recognition.  Lip reading was used to  enhance the sign language recognition for those words with the same  gesture having different means.  To make better sign language  synthesis, gesture motion information was captured to improve the 3D model of virtual human animation.  This paper dominates that the  multimodal human-computer interface is workable to implement the  heterochronous language communication.  28 Refs.

Title: Accent patterning on domain-related information in Swedish travel  dialogues
Abstract: Investigation of travel-domain dialogues reveals travel-agent (  approximately equals System) utterances with intonational contours  characterized by late-timed focal accents on given information.   These accents occur on content words in utterance-initial position.   The accentuation can be assumed to be related to the interactive  nature of the dialogue in which the travel agent links back to a  domain-related concept introduced by the client ( approximately  equals User) and comments on it in an engaged manner.  A perception  test using constructed human-machine dialogues in which the machine  (synthesized) responses vary as to the type of accent pattern on the initial words was developed to test listeners' preference for accent type.  Results indicate that i) focal accents on domain-related  utterance-initial given concepts are indeed preferred to nonfocal  accents and that ii) late-timed focal accents are preferred to  early-timed focal accents.  These results have implications for the  design of the prosody-generating component of human-machine dialogue systems.  25 Refs.

Title: Integrated person identification and expression recognition from  facial images
Abstract: In this paper we propose an integration of face identification and  facial expression recognition.  A face is modeled as a graph where  the nodes represent facial feature points.  This model is used for  automatic face and facial feature point detection, and facial  feature points tracked by applying flexible feature matching.  Face  identification is performed by comparing the graphs representing the input face image with individual models.  Facial expression is  modeled by finding the relationship between the motion of facial  feature points and expression change.  Individual and average  expression models are generated and then used to identify facial  expressions under appropriate categories and the degree of  expression changes.  The expression model used for facial expression  recognition is chosen by the results of face identification.  27  Refs.

Title: Fingerprint identification for enhanced user interface and for secure internet services
Abstract: This paper discusses an application of fingerprint identification  technology to enhanced human-machine interaction, and also to  information systems, specifically to a mobile authentication  terminal for secure networked services and to digital appliances.  A  "Fingerprint User Interface (FpUI)," exploits information regarding  not only who put a finger on its sensor but which specific finger it was.  With this user-friendly interface, a user can assign commands,  data objects, status, or personalized settings to individual  fingers.  A functional architecture for a mobile authentication  terminal, "Pocket-PID," with fingerprint identification capability  is proposed which features an easy-to-use FpUI and high security,  where the identification function is totally enclosed within the  unit.  This enables a user's identity authenticated without any  possibility of actual fingerprint data being disclosed.  The  Pocket-PID facilitates implementation of networked services based on secure biometric user identification.  7 Refs.

Title: Automated eye-movement protocol analysis
Abstract: This article describes and evaluates a class of methods for  performing automated analysis of eye-movement protocols.  Although  eye movements have become increasingly popular as a tool for  investigating user behavior, they can be extremely difficult and  tedious to analyze.  In this article we propose an approach to  automating eye-movement protocol analysis by means of  tracing-relating observed eye movements to the sequential  predictions of a process model.  We present three tracing methods  that provide fast and robust analysis and alleviate the equipment  noise and individual variability prevalent in typical eye-movement  protocols.  We also describe three applications of the tracing  methods that demonstrate how the methods facilitate the use of eye  movements in the study of user behavior and the inference of user  intentions.  86 Refs.

Title: Automatic generation of instructional hypermedia with APHID
Abstract: This research investigates the use of patterns in designing  adaptable, flexible hypermedia applications.  While patterns are  particularly applicable to software design, they can also be used to assist designers of other types of applications.  We have developed a method (APHID) that guides a hypermedia creator through the analysis and design process.  The method ensures that good design principles  are followed, both for the hypermedia application and for the  interface that presents the hypermedia application.  Our method uses  a concept map, constraints, and patterns (instructional and  presentation) to support partial automation for creating hypermedia  applications.  We also present a prototype software system that uses  the APHID method to create instructional hypermedia applications  semi-automatically.  The applications created using APHID are  tailored to specific types of learners.  We conclude with a claim  that this approach is applicable not just to instructional  hypermedia, but to the larger problem of generating adaptable  interfaces. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.  26 Refs.

Title: Toward ubiquitous mining of distributed data
Abstract: The role of data-centric information is becoming increasingly  important in our everyday professional and personal lives.  The  advent of laptops, palmtops, handhelds, and wearable computers is  also making ubiquitous access to large quantity of data possible.   Advanced analysis of distributed data for extracting useful  knowledge is the next natural step in the world of ubiquitous  computing.  However, this will not come for free; it will introduce  additional cost due to communication, computational, security among  others.  Distributed data mining techniques offer a technology to  analyze distributed data by minimizing this cost to maintain the  ubiquitous presence.  This paper adopts the Collective Data Mining  approach that offers a collection of different scalable and  distributed data analysis techniques.  It particularly focuses on two collective techniques for predictive data mining, presents some  experimental results, and points the readers toward more extensive  documentations of the technology.  27 Refs.

Title: Human-level AI's killer application interactive computer games
Abstract: Although one of the fundamental goals of AI is to understand and  develop intelligent systems that have all the capabilities of  humans, there is little active research directly pursuing this goal.  We propose that AI for interactive computer games is an emerging  application area in which this goal of human-level AI can  successfully be pursued.  Interactive computer games have  increasingly complex and realistic worlds and increasingly complex  and intelligent computer-controlled characters.  In this article, we  further motivate our proposal of using interactive computer games  for AI research, review previous research on AI and games, and  present the different game genres and the roles that human-level AI  could play within these genres.  We then describe the research issues and AI techniques that are relevant to each of these roles.  Our  conclusion is that interactive computer games provide a rich  environment for incremental research on human-level AI.  25 Refs.

Title: Information theoretic approach to man-machine interface complexity  evaluation
Abstract: We analyze the interactions between human operators and control room  equipment and find that several factors affect the  information-gathering and decision-making processes of operators:  the contents of provided information, the way information is  provided, and the knowledge of operators.  These factors contribute  to the perceived cognitive complexity by human operators in plant  operation.  Based on the information theory concept, we propose an  integrated framework for evaluating this complexity.  The proposed  framework is designed to be applied to various types of control room equipment which have different types of man-machine interface and  contain different types of information.  An experimental verification for the proposed framework is performed and its result shows that  the framework successfully integrates various aspects of man-machine interface systems and estimates the mental workload of human  operators.  21 Refs.

Title: Collection and exploitation of expert knowledge in web assistant  systems
Abstract: Recent research and commercial developments have highlighted the  importance of human involvement in user support for web information  systems.  In our earlier work a web assistant system has been  introduced, which is a hybrid support system with human web  assistants and computer-based support.  An important issue with web  assistant systems is how to make optimal use of these support  resources.  We use a knowledge management approach with frequently  asked questions for a question-answering system that acts as a  question filter for the human assistants.  Knowledge is continuously  collected from the assistants and exploited to augment the  question-answering capabilities.  Our system has been deployed and  evaluated by an analysis of conversation logs and questionnaires for users and assistants.  The results show that our approach is feasible and useful.  Lessons learned are summarised in a set of  recommendations.

Title: The role of trust and deception in virtual societies
Abstract: We argue that it is important to analyse the role of trust and  deception in interactions between agents in virtual societies.  In  particular, in hybrid situations where artificial agents interact  with human agents it is important that those artificial agents can  reason about the trustworthiness and deceptive actions of the human  counter part.  In order to support this interaction between agents in virtual societies a theory on trust and deception must be developed.  In the literature a wide variety of theories on trust (less so on  deception  ) have been developed, but not specifically for virtual  communities.  Based on these earlier scientific results we make a  first attempt to develop a general theory on trust and deception for virtual communities, and we discuss a number of examples to  illustrate which objectives such a theory should fulfill.

Title: Theory of interorganizational systems: Industry structure and  processes of change
Abstract: This paper outlines a multi-level theory of interorganizational  systems (IOS) that explicitly recognizes the importance of the  industry as a macro-level unit of analysis in addition to the units  (enterprises) at the micro-level.  The roles of the external  environment and the technology-based IOS are also recognized.   Theories of intentional agency drawn from the areas of robotics,  intelligent software agents and human-computer interaction are used  to explain how industry-level activity occurs.  Concerted activity is attributed to the reciprocal causal effect of the group upon the  individual units, rather than to any form of regular group  deliberation about action.  It is expected that change at the  industry level will tend to be incremental, building on routine,  situated actions of different players.  Propositions concerning  industry structure, processes of change and the development of IOS  are illustrated with case studies.

Title: Designing user interfaces using activity theory
Abstract: The mainstream framework of computer-interaction research of  cognitive psychology has come under increasing criticism lately  because of the gap between research results and practical design.   According to under (1996), the main criticism is that traditional  cognitive psychology of design is not able to penetrate the human  side of the interface.  To overcome these limitations, an alternative approach to interface design is necessary.  Activity Theory  incorporates notions of intentionality, history, mediation,  motivation, understanding, culture and community and it is these  aspects that have proved attractive to interface design.  We believe  that Activity Theory offers several benefits to interface design,  compared to the traditional cognitive psychology approach.  This  paper describes a case study involving the use of Activity Theory  for the design and evaluation of a tourist information kiosk.

Title: 'Making conversation': Sequential integrity and the local management  of interaction on internet newsgroups
Abstract: This paper argues for a detailed empirical investigation of newsgroup interaction.  It presents a framework for analysis that emphasizes  the machinic and human character of newsgroup activity with the  concept of '(human) orientation to the (machinic) default'.  By  problematizing the notion of newsgroup 'conversation' the paper  reveals the 'sequential integrity' of newsgroup practices through  the detailed investigation of participants' 'local management of  interaction'.  Newsgroup interaction is a-synchronous: participation  does not occur in 'real time' and participants are geographically  dispersed.  Potentially, therefore, participation could be chaotic  and disordered.  Yet observation reveals it to be a highly ordered  activity.  A fundamental question, then, is how this interactional  order is achieved; and achieved as conversational.  Newsgroup  activity is characterized by sequential integrity.  Messages are  constructed in such a way as to exhibit both relational (between  messages) and internal (in the text of messages) features that mimic and respect sequential ordering.

Title: Discovering rules for fault management
Abstract: At the heart of the Internet revolution is global telecommunication  systems.  These systems, initially designed for voice traffic,  provide the vast backbone bandwidth capabilities necessary for  Internet traffic.  They have built-in redundancy and complexity to  ensure robustness and quality of service.  To facilitate this, this  requires complex fault identification and management systems.  Fault  identification and management is generally handled by reducing the  amount of alarm events (symptoms) presented to the operating  engineer through monitoring, filtering and masking.  The ultimate  goal is to determine and present the actual underlying fault.  While  en-route to automated fault identification it is useful to derive  rules and techniques to attempt to present less symptoms with  greater diagnostic assistance.  With these objectives in mind  computer-assisted human discovery and human-assisted computer  discovery techniques are discussed.  19 Refs.

Title: A learning model for intelligent agents based on classifier systems  and approximate reasoning
Abstract: The objective of this study is to synthesize a learning model capable of successful and effective operation in hard-to-model environments.  Here, we are presenting a structurally simple and functionally  flexible model.  The model follows the learning patterns experienced  by the humans.  The novelty of the adaptive model lies on the  knowledge base, dual learning strategy, and flexible reasoning.  The  knowledge base is allowed to grow for as long as the agent lives.   Learning is brought about by the interaction between two  qualitatively different activities leaving long-term and short-term  marks on the behavior of the agent.  The agent reaches conclusions  using approximate reasoning.  The focus of the model, the agent,  starts life with a blank knowledge base.  It learns as it lives.   Classifiers are used to represent individual experiences.  We  demonstrate the functioning of the model through a case study.  10  Refs.

Title: A neuro-fuzzy approach for robot system safety
Abstract: Robot safety is a critical and largely unsolved problem involving the interaction of man and machine.  This paper presents a new approach  to robot safety which uses an integrated sensing architecture for  monitoring the robot workspace, and a new detection and decision  logic for regulating the safe operation of the robot.  Sensory  information is fused through a trained neural network to produce a  map of the hazards.  Using this combined map, and information about  the robot's current position and velocity, a set of fuzzy logic  rules has been implemented to regulate robot activity.  Simulation  results presented in this paper indicate that this method is both  effective in detection of potentially hazardous situations and  computationally feasible.  49 Refs.

Abstract: The design and development of good quality software is not, in  itself, an easy task.  In the context of Educational Software  development, another major problem is introduced: the user's goal is to learn.  Unfortunately, learning is not a task that might be  modeled and represented on a computer system.  This paper intends to  provide some answers to this problem: a Student Centered Methodology for the Development of Educational Software is presented.  The  methodology makes explicit how the different design choices were  made, in order to obtain a final product that not only takes  advantage of today's interaction technologies, but also makes an  effective use of them. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  40 Refs.

Title: Incorporate support vector machines to content-based image retrieval  with relevant feedback
Abstract: By using relevance feedback [6] ,  Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) allows the user to retrieve  images interactively.  Begin with a coarse query, the user can select the most relevant images and provide a weight of preference for each relevant image to refine the query.  The high level concept borne by  the user and perception subjectivity of the user can be  automatically captured by the system to some degree.  This paper  proposes an approach to utilize both positive and negative feedbacks for image retrieval.  Support Vector Machines (SVM) is applied to  classifying the positive and negative images.  The SVM learning  results are used to update the preference weights for the relevant  images.  This approach releases the user from manually providing  preference weight for each positive example.  Experimental results  show that the proposed approach has improvement over the previous  approach [5] that uses positive examples  only.  11 Refs.

Title: A robust face detection for human interactive mobile robot
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel face detection method to be used for  practical human interactive mobile robot.  Towards future aging  society, there are much expectation and social demand for a mobile  robot that is possible to interactively collaborate and support  human.  Typical examples are pet robot and service robot.  Guard robot is another example.  Face detection and recognition are very crucial  for such applications.  However, in the real situation, it is not  easy to realize the robust detecting function because position,  size, and brightness of face image are much changeable.  The proposed method solves these problems by combining correlation-based pattern  matching, histogram equalization, skin color extraction, and  multiple scale images generation.  The authors have implemented a  prototype system based upon the proposed method and conducted some  experiments using the system.  Experimental results support  effectiveness of the proposed idea.  14 Refs.

Title: Rapid modeling of animated faces from video images
Abstract: Generating realistic 3D human face models and facial animations has  been a persistent challenge in computer graphics.  We have developed  a system that constructs textured 3D face models from videos with  minimal user interaction.  Our system takes images and video  sequences of a face with an ordinary video camera.  After manual  clicks on two images to tell the system where the eye corners, nose  top and mouth corners are, the system automatically generates a  realistic looking 3D human head model and the constructed model can  be animated immediately.  A user, with a PC and an ordinary camera,  can use our system to generate his/her face model in a few minutes.   We will demonstrate the system at the conference.  2 Refs.

Title: Touring into the picture using hand shape recognition
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to prove that using gesture recognition  through implementing the method of touring into the picture makes  navigation very convenient and easy compared to navigation using  mouse and keyboard.  The method of touring into the picture is a  simple technique that converts an 2D image into 3D animation.  This  study shows how to convert 2D image into 3D navigation, implementing the method previously proposed by Horry and Phy on the personal  computer.  Hand shape gesture recognition which functions as a user  interface has been developed into three types: Type-1 means pause;  Type-2 means showing directions on 2D; Type-3 is designed to assign  upper and lower depth in space.  These three types play the role as  virtual mouse and keyboard in 3D-rendering image.  Above all, using  hand-shaped gestures contributes to the ease of user's navigation of 3D space.  8 Refs.

Title: Model-based varying pose face detection and facial feature  registration in video images
Abstract: This paper presents an automatic method for simultaneous human face  detection and facial feature registration from colour video images.   At the first stage, we use a skin colour Gaussian model to identify  possible face locations under varying pose.  Secondly, we compare  image patterns with a varying pose face model in terms of shape and  texture differences, using a combined feature-texture similarity  measure (FTSM).  False detections from the first stage are eliminated by setting an appropriate FTSM threshold.  Moreover, one can also  register the facial features (eyes, nose and mouth) by aligning a  prototype face with the unknown pose faces.  Experimental results  show that the proposed method can achieve reliable face detection  and feature registration under various conditions, including  different poses, face appearances, and lighting conditions.  30 Refs.

Title: Functional paleontology: System evolution as the user sees it
Abstract: It has long been accepted that requirements analysis should precede  architectural design and implementation, but in software evolution  and reverse engineering this concern with black-box analysis of  function has necessarily been de-emphasized in favor of code-based  analysis and designer-oriented interpretation.  In this paper, we  redress this balance by describing "functional paleontology", an  approach to analyzing the evolution of user-visible features or  services independent of architecture and design intent.  We classify  the benefits and burdens of interpersonal communication services  into core and peripheral categories and investigate the telephony  services available to domestic subscribers over a fifty-year period.  We report that services were introduced in discrete bursts, each of  which emphasized different benefits and burdens.  We discuss the  general patterns of functional evolution that this "fossil record"  illustrates and conclude by discussing their implications for  forward engineering of software products.  30 Refs.

Title: Visual servoing based on space variant vision for human-robot  interaction in rehabilitation robots
Abstract: Visual servoing gives autonomous capabilities to a rehabilitation  robot for human-robot interaction.  Though several visual-based  control techniques have been proposed in rehabilitation systems, it  is not easy to get the accurate visual information of a target,  i.e., depth, in real-time.  Specially, the depth information of a  target, such as the distance between a user and a robotic arm, is  closely related to a user;s safety.  As a remedy for this situation,  visual servoing based on space variant vision is proposed for an  eye-in-hand camera configuration.  Space variant vision with vergence movements of a binocular camera head can provides well a robotic arm with the depth information.  In addition, a small and light-weighted  camera head is designed and implemented.  14 Refs.

Title: Environmental control by a brain-computer interface
Abstract: Locked-in patients, such as those with amytrophic lateral sclerosis  (ALS), lose control of their bodies, leaving them unable to perform  simple tasks such as speech. locomotion, and the ability to  effectively interact with their environment.  Brain-Computer  Interfaces (BCI) show promise in allowing these individuals to  interact with a computer using EEG.  A system was created to allow  individuals, via a BCI, to control home appliances and to have the  computer articulate pre-selected words.  It uses ActiveHome from X10  [1] , which can control of a wide variety  of home appliances via a computer, and allows tasks such as light  dimming, TV channel changing, and turning appliances on and off.  The system was evaluated with a set of tasks to measure its ease-of-use, ease-of-learning, rate-of-error, and amount of time the subject  required to complete the task.  9 Refs.

On-line implementations of the LF-ASD has shown promising results in respond to actual index  finger flexions and imagined finger flexions within able-bodied  subjects.  This work reports the results of our first test with  subjects with high-level spinal-cord injuries.  In this study, two  subjects with high-level spinal-cord injuries were able to control  the LF-ASD with imagined voluntary movements with hit (true  positive) rates from 45-48% and false positive rates below 1%.  6  Refs.

Abstract: Voice controlled web browsers allow users to navigate by speaking the text of a link or an associated number instead of clicking with a  mouse.  One such browser is Conversa, by Conversational Computing.   This within subjects study with 18 subjects compared voice browsing  with traditional mouse-based browsing.  It attempted to identify  which of three common hypertext forms (linear slide show, grid/tiled map, and hierarchical menu) are well suited to voice navigation, and whether voice navigation is helped by numbering links.  The study  shows that voice control adds approximately 50% to the performance  time for certain types of tasks.  Subjective satisfaction measures  indicate that for voice browsing, textual links are preferable to  numbered links.  25 Refs.

Title: Sensing techniques for mobile interaction
Abstract: We describe sensing techniques motivated by unique aspects of  human-computer interaction with handheld devices in mobile settings.  Special features of mobile interaction include changing orientation  and position, changing venues, the use of computing as auxiliary to  ongoing, real-world activities like talking to a colleague, and the  general intimacy of use for such devices.  We introduce and integrate a set of sensors into a handheld device, and demonstrate several new functionalities engendered by the sensors, such as recording memos  when the device is held like a cell phone, switching between  portrait and landscape display modes by holding the device in the  desired orientation, automatically powering up the device when the  user picks it up the device to start using it, and scrolling the  display using tilt.  We present an informal experiment, initial  usability testing results, and user reactions to these techniques.   30 Refs.

Title: Detecting assembly actions by scene observation
Abstract: In this paper we present a fast and reliable method to analyse an  image sequence where two human hands perform assembly actions.  Our  classifier to detect the initial skin coloured regions is based on a polynomial classifier of sixth degree.  For each region a judgement  is calculated using two cues.  The first cue is motion information  obtained from a difference image.  The second cue is obtained from  confidence mapping performed on the output of the polynomial  classifier.  All resulting regions with a high judgement indicating  movement are tracked using Kalman filters.  Based on the trajectories of the Kalman filters action hypotheses are generated.  The  hypotheses are verified through a detailed analysis using a Fourier  transformation on the derivatives of the trajectories.  10 Refs.

Title: Multiresolution-histogram indexing and relevance feedback learning  for image retrieval
Abstract: In this paper, two fundamental aspects for content-based image  retrieval system are studied: visual feature extraction and  retrieval system design.  (i) Feature extraction shares some common  properties with image compression where the multiresolution nature  of wavelet decomposition can be exploited.  When wavelet coefficients are vector quantized, the information content in each  spatial-frequency subband is mapped onto coding labels.  Thus, the  statistics of these labels will reflect subband characteristics of  an image.  This constitutes a feature vector that is then used for  image matching.  (ii) The proposed retrieval system supports queries  based on system-user interaction that utilise non-Euclidean  similarity measure.  A non-linear function based on a radial basis  function (RBF) is adopted for characterising the behaviour of human  users in an interactive section where relevance feedback is applied.  Experimental results show that the retrieval efficiency is  considerably improved by implementing the proposed approach.  10  Refs.

Title: Computational construction kits for geometric modeling and design  (panel abstract)
Abstract: Although a current hot topic, tangible user interfaces (TUIs) have  been studied for quite some time.  One particular kind of TUI has  been investigated repeatedly: during the past 20 years several  groups have developed "intelligent" building blocks that can  self-describe the geometric structures into which they are  assembled.  These computational construction kits (CCKs) give users  an extremely intuitive way to express 3D geometry, and have been  used for a variety of different geometric modeling and design  applications.  In this panel we will review the development of CCKs,  from the first such systems to the most recent, and speculate about  future developments.  The panelists will present and demonstrate  artifacts from several CCKs, most of which have not been shown  previously at SIGGRAPH, CHI, UIST, or I3D.  43 Refs.

Title: The human-computer interface is the system; A plea for a poor man's  HCI component in software engineering curricula
Abstract: Most software engineering approaches restrict the user interface to  everything a user may perceive or experience.  As a result, it is  often designed rather independently of the system's functionality.   Chances are then that it does not get the attention it deserves.  In  the approach to software development we sketch, the design of the  user interface and the design of the functionality go hand in hand.   We give a number of examples of user interface problems, and  illustrate how these can be caught early if a more integrated  approach is taken.  We conclude with an outline of a minimal course  on human-computer interaction that we feel should be part of  everyone's software engineering curriculum.  11 Refs.

Title: Feature-oriented programming: A new way of object composition
Abstract: We propose a new model for flexible composition of objects from a set of features.  Features are services of an object and are similar to  classes in object-oriented languages.  In many cases, features have  to be adapted in the presence of other features, which is also  called the feature interaction problem.  We introduce explicit  interaction handlers which can adapt features to other features by  overriding methods.  When features are composed, the appropriate  interaction handling is added in a way which generalizes inheritance and aggregation.  For a set of features, an exponential number of  different feature combinations is possible, based on a quadratic  number of interaction resolutions.  We present the feature model as  an extension of Java and give two translations to Java, one via  inheritance and the other via aggregation.  We show that the feature  model interacts nicely with several common language extensions such  as type parameters, exceptions, and higher-order functions.  31 Refs.

It is very  important to improve the level of operators and vindicators.  The  structure, principle and software implementation of a 3D dynamic  simulation system for hydroelectric generating units are introduced.

Title: Teachers as simulation programmers: Minimalist learning and reuse
Abstract: Five public school teachers were observed during two self-study  sessions where they learned to use Visual AgenTalk (VAT).  The first  session emphasized the basic visual programming skills, while the  second introduced ways to reuse existing simulations.  Two versions  of the reuse tutorial were developed, one offering a concrete  example world for reuse, and the second an abstract world.  During  their learning and reuse sessions, the teachers thought out loud as  they worked, enabling a detailed analysis of their goals, reactions, problems, and successes.  After each session, the teachers also  completed user reaction questionnaires.  Although all teachers  succeeded in learning the basics of VAT, they varied considerably in their reuse of the example simulations.  It appears that the  simplified components of the abstract world supported reuse to a  greater degree than those of the concrete example world.  25 Refs.

Title: Conversation trees and threaded chats
Abstract: Chat programs and instant messaging services are increasingly popular among Internet users.  However, basic issues with the interfaces and  data structures of most forms of chat limit their utility for use in formal interactions (like group meetings) and decision-making tasks.  In this paper, we discuss Threaded Text Chat, a program designed to  address some of the deficiencies of current chat programs.  Standard  forms of chat introduce ambiguity into interaction in a number of  ways, most profoundly by rupturing connections between turns and  replies.  Threaded Chat presents a solution to this problem by  supporting the basic turn-taking structure of human conversation.   While the solution introduces interface design challenges of its  own, usability studies show that users' patterns of interaction in  Threaded Chat are equally effective, but different (and possibly  more efficient) than standard chat programs.  23 Refs.

Title: Involving users in the specification of functionality using scenarios and model-based evaluation
Abstract: The research investigated how input from users can be used to inform  system design at an early stage.  The study was conducted in the  context of a smart card project in an educational organization.   Scenarios of smart card system use were developed based on claims  analysis.  For the purpose of evaluating the scenarios, a model of  system acceptance was devised.  Evaluation questionnaires based on  the acceptance model were developed and used by potential system  users to evaluate the scenarios.  Multiple regression analysis of the questionnaire responses indicated which causal links in the  acceptance model were significant, and enabled the elements of  system functionality likely to have an impact on acceptance to be  identified.  This approach enables the importance of particular  system functions to be assessed at an early stage of system design.   (Author abstract) 31 Refs.

Title: Augmented sensing by means of intelligent space
Abstract: This paper's research aim is realizing an 'Intelligent Space'.  This Intelligent Space is a platform when realizing multi agent systems.  In order to build the multi agent systems, the most important element is a human interface technology in the Intelligent Space.  It is important for this human interface technology to think about 'universal design approach' and 'cognitive science approach'.  These approaches are the convenient approach for all people: not only young people but also elderly people and handicapped people.  In order to realize the human interface, this paper proposes an 'augmented sensing'.  Human can feel invisible information to be visible information by using this augmented sensing.  This paper explains the augmented sensing in detail and show an effectiveness of the augmented sensing in the Intelligent Space.  (Author abstract) 5 Refs.

IGA (Interactive Genetic Algorithm) has been applied to searching for the objective image.  Furthermore, the fuzzy reasoning has been adopted to assign the fitness in the IGA.  The fuzzy reasoning has been executed in the psychometrical space and the fitness has been obtained from the result of the fuzzy reasoning.  Therefore, the user's load has been reduced very much and his sense has been reflected on the fitness assignment process as well.  (Author abstract) 7 Refs.

Title: PeopleGarden: creating data portraits for users
Abstract: Many on-line interaction environments have a large number of users.  It is difficult for the participants, especially new ones, to form a clear mental image about those with whom they are interacting.  How can we compactly convey information about these participants to each other? We propose the data portrait, a novel graphical representation of users based on their past interactions.  Data portraits can inform users about each other and the overall social environment.  We use a flower metaphor for creating individual data portraits, and a garden metaphor for combining these portraits to represent an on-line environment.  We will review previous work in visualizing both individuals and groups.  We will then describe our visualizations, explain how to create them, and show how they can be used to address user questions.  (Author abstract) 27 Refs.

Title: Base-rate fallacy and its implications for the difficulty of intrusion detection
Abstract: Many different demands can be made of intrusion detection systems.  An important requirement is that it be effective i.e. that it should detect a substantial percentage of intrusions into the supervised system, while still keeping the false alarm rate at an acceptable level.  This paper aims to demonstrate that, for a reasonable set of assumption, the false alarm rate is the limiting factor for the performance of an intrusion detection system.  This is due to the base-rate fallacy phenomenon, that in order to achieve substantial values of the Bayesian detection rate, P(Intrusion vertical bar Alarm), we have to achieve-a perhaps unattainably low - false alarm rate.  A selection of reports of intrusion detection performance are reviewed, and the conclusion is reached that there are indications that at least some types of intrusion detection have far to go before they can attain such low false alarm rates.

Title: TREC interactive with Cheshire II
Abstract: This paper describes the UC Berkeley's participation in the TREC-6, 7 and 8 interactive track experiments.  In these three studies 24 searchers (four in TREC-6, eight in TREC-7, and 12 in TREC-8) conducted a total of 160 searches, half on the Cheshire II system and the other half on the ZPRISE system.  In TREC-7 and TREC-8 questionnaires were administered to gather information about basic demographic and searching experience, about each search, about each of the systems, and finally, about the user's perceptions of the systems.  In this paper I will briefly describe the systems used in the study and how they differ in design goals and implementation.  The results of the interactive track evaluations and the information derived from the questionnaires are then discussed and plans for further research are considered.  (Author abstract) 10 Refs.

Title: Human-computer interface design issues for a multi-cultural and multi-lingual English speaking country - Botswana
Abstract: This paper reports on research carried out to determine whether a localized interface is preferred by users in a multi-cultural and multi-lingual country where a non-local language is nationally used.  We attempted to discover whether local symbols are more acceptable to users as icons and also whether the current phrases used in menus and icon descriptions are clearly understood by the various communities.  A survey was conducted nation-wide among computer end-users in Botswana.  The results indicate an overwhelming desire from users for a localized interface.  However, there appears to be little need for localized icons and no agreement as to which language to use for text-based interfaces.  (Author abstract) 16 Refs.

Title: Semiotic engineering principles for evaluating end-user programming environments
Abstract: End user programming (EUP) environments are difficult to evaluate empirically.  Most users do not engage in programming, and those who do are often discouraged by the complexity of programming tasks.  Often the difficulties arise from the programming languages in which users are expected to express themselves.  But there are other difficulties associated with designing extensions and adjustments to artifacts that have been originally designed by others.  This paper characterizes EUP as a semiotic design process, and presents two principles that can be used to illustrate the distinctions between the various kinds of techniques and approaches proposed in this field.  The principles support a preliminary theoretical model of EUP and should thus facilitate the definition and interpretation of empirical evaluation studies.  They also define some specific semiotic qualifications that more usable and applicable EUP languages could be expected to have.  (Author abstract) 46 Refs.

Title: Comparing two spreadsheet calculation paradigms: An empirical study with novice users
Abstract: Empirical studies of spreadsheet programming have commonly shown high overall error rates but only little attention has been paid to reasons for these errors.  One often mentioned cause for errors is the low conceptual level of spreadsheet systems, e.g. the lack of abstraction and modularity mechanisms.  By offering these kinds of mechanisms to spreadsheet users, we wanted to study whether the conceptual level has an effect on types of errors produced.  The higher conceptual level paradigm offered is the structured spreadsheet calculation paradigm, which utilizes goals, plans and spreadsheet data structures in computation.  In this paper, we present an empirical study with novice users, comparing the traditional spreadsheet calculation paradigm and the structured spreadsheet calculation paradigm.  The results show that the two different paradigms produce different error behaviors.  (Author abstract) 36 Refs.

Title: Flexible automatic test system for turbine machinery
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to discuss the general development of a Flexible Automatic Test System For Turbine Machinery (FATSFTM).  In order to meet the test needs of a large and diverse community of turbine machinery, the automatic test system should have a contemporary windows interface, have graphical interaction and be easily configured to include the functions required by current and emerging test demands.  The design and implementation of such a test system is approached from an object-oriented (OO) software engineering point-of-view for ease of extension, expansion and maintenance.  Practical application has proved the validity and effect of the implemented automatic test system in helping turbine developers improve the performance of turbine machinery.

Title: Understanding strategy selection
Abstract: This paper explores several issues associated with explanations of why different people use different strategies for learning and inference tasks.  It is suggested that although the concept of cognitive style is a useful starting point, it is unable to account for many findings in the literature, and that any model of strategy usage that confines itself to mechanisms governing strategy selection is incomplete.  In addition, it is necessary to take account of strategy availability: Which strategies do people possess, and how do people discover new strategies? Several findings in the literature indicate that strategy discovery is related to general abilities.  Specifically, those who are best able to execute a current strategy are those who are the most likely to identify new, more effective methods.  It is suggested that many findings that support the notion of cognitive style can be reinterpreted in this light.  (Author abstract) 59 Refs.

Title: Digital watermarking scheme using human visual effects
Abstract: A watermarking technique for copyright protection of images is proposed in this paper.  The idea is to use the human visual effects as the feature of images.  The embedding strategy is to put the extracted image feature together with the watermark to generate the secret key for watermark retrieval.  This strategy for watermarking system is wholly different from previous works.  In addition, a voting approach is used to improve the correctness of the retrieved watermarks.  The experimental results show that our method can against attacks by many image altering algorithms, such as filtering, lossy compression, rotation and so on.  Furthermore, the proposed scheme is not only applicable to ordinary natural images but also to cartoon graphics.  (Author abstract) 22 Refs.

Abstract: The emerging learning society requires a different development strategy, but also a conceptual and statistical framework that goes beyond the conventional approach and provides a broader dynamic framework for policy analysis.  The novel time distance methodology is applied to the analysis of digital divide in the USA by income and educational level.  It also shows that different statistical measures lead to diverse conclusions about the gap between North America and Europe in Internet users per capita.  Percentage difference is decreasing, while time distance is increasing.  Policy discussion relates to preparation of national strategy for information society in Slovenia.

Title: Adaptive user interfaces for automotive environments
Abstract: Our research group is investigating the use of adaptive user interfaces for in-car information access.  These interfaces attempt to efficiently provide content the driver needs and wants, and gather feedback on these preferences through the driver's interaction with the system.  In this way, the performance of the system improves as it unobtrusively builds a more accurate model of the user.  The three systems presented here are the Adaptive Route Advisor for navigation, the Adaptive News Reader for news stories, and the Adaptive Place Advisor for restaurant selection.  All of these systems provide useful information to a driver, and we argue they do not negatively impact safety because they are replacing other, less effective, information sources.  We intend to test this hypothesis in future studies.  (Author abstract) 9 Refs.

Title: Guidelines for writing HTML help
Abstract: This paper provides guidelines for writing HTML help content for end users of Apple hardware and software products.  The guidelines were developed by the editors in Apple Computer's Instructional Products (IP) group to respond to the problems that arose as documentation shifted from print books to HTML help.  Initially, writers struggled to  retrofit' their print content for the onscreen environment.  However, the differences in how users interact with print and onscreen help demanded not just a small revision, but a major rethinking of the instructional content.  Looking to minimalist principles for guidance, we created these guidelines to help writers develop content that supported the goal of Apple's HTML help: to help users get tasks done without slowing them down or getting in their way.

Title: Making formal methods practical
Abstract: Despite its potential, formal methods have difficulty gaining acceptance in the industrial sector.  Some complaints are based on supposed impracticality: Many consider formal methods to be an approach to system specification and analysis that requires a large learning time.  Contributing to this skepticism is the fact that some types of formal methods have not yet been proven to handle systems of realistic complexity.  To learn more about how to design formal specification languages that can be used for complex systems and require minimal training, we developed a formal specification of an English language specification of the vertical flight control system similar to that found in the MD-11.  This paper describes the lessons learned from this experience.  A companion paper at this conference describes how the model can be used in human-computer interaction analysis and pilot task analysis.  (Author abstract) 3 Refs.

Abstract: This paper describes a usability analysis of concepts and procedures associated with the introduction of synthesized voice and automatic speech recognition for electronic data communications between flight crews and air traffic controllers.  Several structured interviews with professional pilots were conducted over a period of two weeks.  Questions posed to these experts were twofold.  Will synthesized voice annunciation of data linked Air Traffic Control (ATC) messages improve the human interface and increase the ability of the pilot to interact with these ATC messages? Secondly, will an automatic speech recognition system increase the pilot's ability to respond to and/or create new ATC data linked messages? This paper will highlight the results of this analysis and provide recommendations for designers.  (Author abstract) 13 Refs.

Title: Using empirical distributions to characterize web client traffic and to generate synthetic traffic
Abstract: We model a web client using empirical probability distributions for user clicks and transferred data sizes.  By using a heuristic threshold value to distinguish user clicks in a packet trace we get a simple method for analyzing large packet traces in order to get information about user OFF times and amount of data transferred due to a user click.  We derive the empirical probability distributions from the analysis of the packet trace.  The heuristic is not perfect, but we believe it is good enough to produce a useful web client model.  We use the empirical model to implement a web client traffic generator.  The characteristics of the generated traffic is very close to the original packet trace, including self-similar properties.

Title: Knowledge-based models for emergency management systems
Abstract: This paper proposes the use of advanced knowledge models to support environmental emergency management as an adequate response to the current needs and technology.  A generic architecture embodying the knowledge pieces required to manage emergencies in different kinds of problem scenarios is described.  Simulation models of the physical system, integrated as part of the knowledge architecture, are also claimed to be adequate, both from the point of view of the knowledge model calibration and the training of the emergency personnel as well.  The feasibility of the approach has been demonstrated with the application of the generic model to a particular real world problem: the management of flood emergencies in the Jucar river basin area (Spain).  This work was developed in the framework of ARTEMIS, a European Commission research project.  (Author abstract) 8 Refs.

Title: The design of protocol for e-voting on the Internet
Abstract: This paper proposes a practical anonymous secure electronic voting  protocol in which the communications are based on the Internet.  This protocol employs the blind signature to ensure only eligible  registered voters can participate in the election activity, and each eligible registered voter can securely vote at most once.  This  protocol, with secret sharing methods, prevents any facility from  falsifying the result of voting, while achieving the fairness of  voting.  Our e-voting system is easy to be implemented, since the  integration of the user interface with a web browser and the e-mail  software would make it easier.  We believe that our system will be an efficient, fairly, and practical voting system.  26 Refs.

Title: High-speed implementation of an ECC-based wireless authentication  protocol on an ARM microprocessor
Abstract: The results of the implementation of elliptic curve cryptography  (ECC) over the field GF(p) on an 80MHz, 32-bit ARM microprocessor  are presented.  A practical software library has been produced which  supports variable length implementation of the elliptic curve  digital signature algorithm (ECDSA).  The ECDSA and a recently  proposed ECC-based wireless authentication protocol are implemented  using the library.  Timing results show that the 160-bit ECDSA  signature generation and verification operations take around 46ms  and 94ms, respectively.  With these timings, the execution of the  ECC-based wireless authentication protocol takes around 140ms on the ARM7TDMI processor, which is a widely used, low-power core processor for wireless applications.  20 Refs.

Title: Delay performance of voice and MMPP video traffic in cellular  wireless ATM network
Abstract: An approximate analysis is derived of real-time voice and Markov  modulated Poisson process (MMPP) video traffic over an enhanced time division multiple access with dynamic reservation (TDMA/DR) MAC  protocol in a wireless ATM setting.  This yields the mean delay and  the delay distribution of such traffic under light loads (less than  60% of the total channel capacity).  The reasonableness of the  approximate analysis is verified by simulation.  Numerical results  indicate that the delay performances of voice and MMPP video traffic types are well within the respective delay tolerance for real-time  services.  The results lead to the conjecture that the enhanced  TDMA/DR is a viable MAC protocol for handling real-time services in  an integrated services wireless ATM system.  18 Refs.

Abstract: The capabilities of the Georgia Tech Virtual Geographic Information  System (GTVGIS) have been extended recently to take full advantage  of the internal client-server internal structure that we have used  in our stand-alone visualization capabilities.  Research is underway  in the creation of 2 additional client-server modes that will allow  GTVGIS capabilities to be accessed by laptop client systems with  high quality rendering capability and by very inexpensive  lightweight client laptop and possibly hand held computing platforms that need only to support standard web browsers (with JAVA  capabilities).  Interface to large, remote, databases is over IP  protocols is necessary for these new GTVGIS modes.  This paper  describes each mode of GTVGIS and the capabilities and requirements  for hardware and software for each of the modes.  13 Refs.

Title: M3POC: A multimedia multicast transport protocol for cooperative  applications
Abstract: Recent experiments in collaborative working have shown some technical limitations that delay the deployment of such applications.  The  support of variable multimedia quality of service (QoS) is often  insufficient, multicast services are badly adapted to the group  requirements, and over all, the co-operative features of persons  involved in a group work session are not taken into account.  This  paper then proposes an architecture solving these problems, lying on a new transport protocol M3POC.  Mechanisms and services provided by  this transport protocol are presented according to the related  problem.  We will then focus on improvements due to the multicast  partial reliability and order concept applied to multiple  consecutive multimedia connections.  15 Refs.

Title: Scalable MPEG-4 video coding with graceful packet-loss resilience  over bandwidth-varying networks
Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the packet loss resilience of the recently developed MPEG-4 Fine-Granular-Scalability (FGS) video coding method for Interact streaming applications.  Since unrecoverable packet  losses are very common over the Internet, the focus of this study is to determine how robust the MPEG-4 FGS coding tool is under  unrecoverable IP packet-losses over a wide range of connection  qualities (i.e. at various bit-rates).  Our extensive study was  performed upon an entire set of sequences, bit-rates and packet-loss rates.  As shown in this paper, under Unequal Packet-loss Protection, FGS provides a clear advantage over non-scalable coding.  If Equal  Packet-loss Protection is employed, FGS performance is still  considerably better, in particular under moderate-to-high  packet-loss ratios.  6 Refs.

Title: A multimedia terminal architecture for dynamically configurable  protocol stacks
Abstract: This paper presents a generic architecture for multimedia terminals  with respect to the management and implementation of dynamic and  programmable protocol stacks.  This architecture is built around the  combination of CORBA based management components and real-time  multimedia data processing engines.  The management objects export a  set of easily usable interfaces, which allow cascading and  configuring the engines in such a way that they terminate multimedia network connections with the desired protocol stack.  Terminal  software components, which are designed according to existing  multimedia delivery standards (such as TINA or H.323) can be easily  integrated with these CORBA components in order to introduce dynamic programmable multimedia endpoints in the terminal(s).  7 Refs.

Title: Efficient hardware-software co-design for the G.723.1 algorithm  targeted at VoIP applications
Abstract: With the growing demand for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)  services, it has become increasingly important to design ASICs  implementing the H.323 algorithm efficiently, with capabilities of  handling multiple channels, so as to allow cost-effective  implementation of H.323 GSTN and ISDN Gateways.  In this paper, the  G.723.1 speech codec, which is an integral part of the H.323  specification, is investigated and an efficient hardware-software  co-design is proposed.  This design reduces the MIPS requirement for  the G.723.1 implemented on the 16-bit OAK DSP core by 17%for the 5.3 kbits/s encoder and by 11% for the 6.3 kbits/s encoder.  This is  achieved by identifying the inherent parallelism in the G.723.1  algorithm and implementing a sizeable portion of the algorithm in  hardware, while the DSP is concurrently executing part of the  algorithm.  The overhead of transferring data between the firmware  and hardware is reduced by using efficient memory access structures.  11 Refs.

Title: Flexible multimedia system for multimedia communication services
Abstract: Distributed multimedia system which not only integrates various  multimedia information distributed over computer networks and but  also provides it to users in accordance with the user's requirements during realtime multimedia communication must guarantee the user  requested quality of services (QoS) even though the computer and  network resources change statically or dynamically.  We have proposed a flexible multimedia system (FMS) which is based on agent-oriented  architecture and is able to organize required functions itself.  This paper describes about the FMS architecture for multimedia  teleconference service with adaptive QoS guarantee functions.  In  multimedia teleconference service, FMS is able to realize the one of multimedia communication services flexibly for service requests and  QoS requests from users.  5 Refs.

Abstract: Networking of MPEG-4 content is the topic of ongoing standardization  efforts in the ISO MPEG and IETF.  In this paper, we describe a  complete architecture for the transport of MPEG-4 content over the  Internet.  The MPEG-4 concept of separation between applications and  delivery mechanism is preserved.  The use of well-established  Internet protocols, such as the Real Time Protocol (RTP) and the  Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) allows for robustness and  flexibility in view of interoperability and future extensions.  In  particular, we present an original proposal for the mapping of  MPEG-4 specific signaling primitives onto RTSP functions.  6 Refs.

Title: MQ: An integrated mechanism for multimedia multicasting
Abstract: This paper explores the problems associated with the integration of  IP multicast, QoS routing and resource reservation to support  multimedia group communications in the presence of user  heterogeneity.  A protocol called MQ, Multicast with QoS, is proposed to support multimedia multicasting with QoS guarantees.  With MQ,  while resource reservation is de-coupled from multicast QoS routing, they are integrated in such a way to avoid "sender-oriented" path  determination, a problem which occurs when RSVP is used with QoS  routing for heterogeneous reservations.  Being a truly  receiver-oriented and integrated scheme for multimedia multicasting, MQ enjoys lower blocking probability for users to join the groups of interest with the requested QoS, much reduced protocol overheads,  and better resource usability to enhance system performance,  compared to conventional approaches that employ loosely coupled  integration of IP multicasting, resource reservation and QoS  routing.  10 Refs.

Title: Network-adaptive rate control with TCP-friendly protocol for multiple video objects
Abstract: Delivering visual content over the Internet with acceptable quality  is an important and challenging task.  In order to maintain good  quality of service (QoS) in the current best-effort Internet,  bandwidth adaptation to the varying network conditions is desired  for streaming video over the Internet.  In this paper, we propose a  new rate control scheme for streaming MPEG4 video containing  multiple video objects in conjunction with a TCP- friendly transport protocol that dynamically estimates available network bandwidth on  the fly.  Furthermore, network packet loss rate is taken into account in rate adaptation so that the end-to-end distortion is minimized.   Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed  scheme.  7 Refs.

Abstract: This paper discusses ways of sending an image to a large number of  nodes in a short time using TCP.  We are developing an electronic  chalkboard system that transmits a still image of a teacher's screen to a large number of student terminals.  This system employs TCP for  reliability.  Therefore, in order to transmit image data in a short  time using TCP. which uses point-to-point communication, the route  of data transmission in this system is tree-shaped, and the data is  transmitted in a parallel, step-by-step mode.  We compare the  transmission time of data for several transmission routes and  partitions of the unit of data in our system.  10 Refs.

Title: On TCP-friendly video transfer with consideration on  application-level QoS
Abstract: When both TCP and UDP sessions co-exist in the Internet, the  performance of TCP sessions easily deteriorate because of congestion incurred by UDP sessions of real-time multimedia applications.  In  this paper, we extend the TCP-friendly rate control protocol which  originally pursuits the fair-share of link bandwidth among TCP and  non-TCP sessions.  With our proposed method, the achievable  application-level QoS, such as perceived video quality and file  transfer delay, becomes the same among TCP and non-TCP which  traverse the same path.  Through simulation experiments, we show that the high quality video transfer can be performed with our proposed  method while satisfying the TCP-friendliness with regard to  application-level QoS.  11 Refs.

Title: Remotely keyed encryption with java cards: A secure and efficient  method to encrypt multimedia streams
Abstract: Multimedia data streams often require encryption; examples include  digital pay-TV and workstation video conferencing.  The secret key  should be carried in a personal device such as a smart card or an  i-button.  However the processor on such a device is too slow to  encrypt/decrypt the multimedia stream in real-time.  We show that  remotely keyed encryption can be used to solve the problem: for each block of multimedia data the host sends a data-dependent challenge  to the card, the card computes a session key based on the challenge  and the secret key and sends it back to the host.   Encryption/decryption of the main data stream is then entirely done  on the (fast) host.  The secret key never leaves the card.  We also  present experimental performance results for our scheme using an  i-button programmed in Java and a PC as the host.  17 Refs.

Title: Multi-level reliability in multimedia collaboration over  heterogeneous networks
Abstract: Recently there has been great interest in multimedia collaboration  over the Internet to support teamwork without the need for  geographical and/or time proximity.  Different collaborative  scenarios require different communication characteristics.  Besides  unreliable and reliable communications, some collaborative  applications can benefit from partially reliable communication,  especially in heterogeneous networks.  This leads to the concept of  multilevel reliability.  In this paper, the concept of partial  reliability and spiral multicast for achieving partially reliable  communication are presented.  Unlike reliable multicast, spiral  multicast consumes less bandwidth, has faster response time, and  does not suffer from the implosion problem.  Architecture and  performance studies of multi-level reliability in multimedia  collaboration are presented.  18 Refs.

Title: Protocol for collaborative multimedia presentations
Abstract: Many multimedia presentation applications involve retrieval of  objects from more than one collaborating server.  For instance, we  can consider distributed video servers where blocks of movies are  distributed over a set of servers.  Here, blocks of a movie from  different video servers have to be retrieved and presented  continuously without any gaps in the presentation.  Such applications first need an estimate of the available network resources to each of the collaborating server in order to identify a schedule for  retrieving the objects composing the presentation.  A collaborating  server can suggest modifications of the retrieval schedule depending on its load.  These modifications can potentially affect the  retrieval schedule for other collaborating applications.  In this  paper, we propose an application sub-layer protocol, Resource Lock  Commit Protocol (RLCP), for handling the negotiation and commitment  of the resources required for a collaborative multimedia  presentation application.  11 Refs.

Abstract: Controller Area Networks (CANs) can be used in the framework of real  time distributed industrial applications.  Regardless of the  application, it is very important to reduce the worst-case queueing  delay and the longest time taken to transmit a message in the MAC  (scheduling) and physical (choice of efficient modulation schemes)  sublayers.  In this paper, an extension of the basic Orthogonal  Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) principle known as On-Off  Keying modulation (OOK/OFDM-Multi-Carrier) switching principle is  given.  The influence of the presence of MultiPath Fading (MPF) on  the propagation segment and consequently on the real debits of CAN  networks for Wireless indoor communications is shown.  Furthermore,  some implementation details of emission and reception chains of a  modem-radio based on OOK and OFDM modulation schemes chosen for  Wireless communications are presented.

Title: Hart to enterprise connectivity
Abstract: The HART protocol was established as an open, de-facto industry  standard in 1990.  More than 10 million installed devices are in  operation worldwide benefiting from HART communication.  A  traditional view shared by many in the user community is that data  from the intelligent HART-capable field instruments is only  obtainable via a standard hand held terminal.  The reality is far  from the perception.  This paper describes how a personal computer  based server productivity tool can use HART communication to connect one or more intelligent instruments to the rest of the enterprise.   The server, which is based on the OPC standard, enables application  software packages such as SCADA/HMI software, Internet web browser,  Excel spreadsheet, SQC/SPC, MES, DCS, and Enterprise Resource  Planning software to receive real-time information from HART-capable instrumentation.  The open system standard based approach results in  lower integration costs and improved productivity for a very small  investment.  3 Refs.

Title: Online asset management software facilitates instrument commissioning
Abstract: An online asset management system, using open communications  protocols and standards, provides access to vital field device  information, enabling technicians to significantly reduce the time  required to commission new instruments during project start-up.   Asset management software collects data generated by smart field  instruments and stores it in a central database.  In addition to  collecting data, asset management software allows users to  configure, monitor, and troubleshoot smart instruments throughout  the start-up.  Time-consuming tasks such as zero trim of a pressure  transmitter, loop checks, and device status can all be performed  faster from a PC in the maintenance shop.  Since plant personnel  communicate with field devices from this central location, the  number of trips to the field is significantly reduced, allowing  issues that arise during project start-up to be addressed quickly.

Title: Managing field instrumentation using internet technologies
Abstract: Internet technologies, such as TCP/IP on Ethernet, have been growing  in popularity as methods of communicating with field  instrumentation.  A benefit of this trend is that several commercial  technologies using TCP/IP on Ethernet can provide advanced  management features within instruments.  Technologies such as the Web can provide easy access to devices from web browser software that is included in most operating systems.  This access can provide a simple management mechanism to alter calibration settings, review user  documentation, and update maintenance logs within a device.  This  management mechanism can significantly reduce maintenance costs and  increase ease-of-use.  Within some installations, TCP/IP on a  wireless link can replace Ethernet to further increase the benefits.  This presentation will include a demonstration of technologies that  facilitate field instrument management over TCP/IP on Ethernet and  TCP/IP on a wireless link.

Does it have a place on the factory floor? Is it cost effective? Can it seamlessly integrate with newer, Windows-based standards such as OPC? This session, aimed at software developers and IT personnel, will discuss some of the  key Linux benefits - over 30 years of Unix experience,  non-proprietary, no licensing fees, broad support of all standard  Internet protocols - and its suitability as a platform for modern  data acquisition and process control.  In particular, the session  will focus on interoperability between Linux and Windows-based  systems through evolving technologies like OPC over XML and existing third-party middleware solutions.  3 Refs.

Title: Interface for distributed automation group object model
Abstract: Ethernet, Web/Internet protocols and modern object programming  methods are laying the foundation for truly distributed automation  systems.  The broad goals are to enable code re-usability (and reduce development effort), promote interoperability among products from  different vendors, and ease the integration of automation and  business processes.  However, this foundation requires a  comprehensive communication and engineering architecture to take  full advantage of these technologies.  The Interface for Distributed  Automation Group (IDA) is an open consortium of vendors including  Schneider Electric, Phoenix Contact, Kuka, Jetter, Lenze, Sick,  AG-E, and Real-Time Innovations organized to create an open  architecture for distributed intelligence based on industry-standard Ethernet and Web/Internet protocols.  IDA's joint development efforts will be published as an open standard.  This paper describes the IDA  architecture for distributed automation and introduces the object  model.  4 Refs.

Title: Using the draft H.26L video coding standard for mobile applications
Abstract: The main goals of the new ITU-T H.26L standardization effort are  enhanced compression performance and provision of a  "network-friendly" packet-based video representation addressing  "conversational" (i.e., video telephony) and "non-conversional"  (i.e., storage, broadcast, or streaming) applications.  Hence, the  H.26L design covers a Video Coding Layer (VCL), which provides the  core high-compression representation of the video picture content,  and a Network Adaptation Layer (NAL), which packages that  representation for delivery over a particular type of network.  The  H.26L VCL test model has achieved a significant improvement in  rate-distortion efficiency - providing nearly a factor of two in  bit-rate savings when comparing against the H.263+ test model.  NAL  designs are being developed to transport the coded video data over  existing and future networks such as circuit-switched wired  networks, IP networks with RTP packetization, and 3G wireless  systems.  The NAL is also designed to enable simple gateway operation in heterogeneous transmission scenarios.  14 Refs.

Title: Source adaptive TCP-compatible rate control for video over the  internet
Abstract: This paper describes a rate control algorithm that captures not only  the behavior of TCP's congestion control avoidance mechanism but  also the delay constraints of real-time streams.  Building upon the  TFRC protocol, a new protocol based on RTP/RTCP has been designed in order to better take into account the multimedia flows  characteristics in the estimation of the bandwidth prediction model  parameters.  Given the current channel state, the encoder and decoder buffers states and the delay constraints of the real-time video are  translated into encoder rate constraints.  This global rate control  model that encompasses the source buffer model as well as the  end-to-end delay characteristics allows to reduce significantly the  source timeouts, hence to minimize the expected distortion, for a  comparable usage of the TCP compatible predicted bandwidth.  6 Refs.

Title: MPLS versus MPLS   MPLS versus MPLS
Abstract: Exponential growth in Internet users and Internet traffic and a  general increase in the importance of the Internet Protocol (IP) are prompting a large number of telecoms carriers to build a universal  IP transport platform.  Such a network is under growing pressure to  provide new transmission characteristics and verifiable service  features to meet the needs of a broad new range of business and  residential applications.  Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS),  currently in the standardisation phase, looks set to offer a  flexible solution for overcoming present-day constraints in the  Internet Protocol in the areas of scalability, traffic engineering,  quality of service (QoS) and virtual private networks (VPN).  This  summary describes how MPLS operates and how it can be deployed in  the carrier area in conjunction with other technologies.  It also  presents the key properties of MPLS technology and network  architectures.  1 Refs.

Title: Jitter-based delay-boundary prediction of wide-area networks
Abstract: The delay-boundary prediction algorithms currently implemented by  transport protocols are lowpass filters based on autoregressive and  moving average (ARMA) models.  However, recent studies have revealed  a fractal-like structure of delay sequences, which may not be well  suited to ARMA models.  In this paper, we propose a novel  delay-boundary prediction algorithm based on a deviation-lag  function (DLF) to characterize end-to-end delay variations.  Compared to conventional algorithms derived from ARMA models, the new  algorithm can adapt to delay variations more rapidly and share  delay's robust high-order statistical information (jitter deviation) among competing connections along a common network path.  Preliminary experiments show that it outperforms Jacobson's algorithm, which is  based on an ARMA model, by significantly reducing the prediction  error rate.  To show the practical feasibility of the DLF algorithm,  we also propose a skeleton implementation model.  17 Refs.

Title: Photonic access node using optical code-based label processing and  its applications to optical data networking
Abstract: An ultrahigh-speed photonic access node using optical code-based  photonic add-drop multiplexing (PADM) and its novel applications to  optical data networking are proposed.  PADM processes a photonic  label of packet, which is mapped onto an optical code, and  adds-drops the packet from or to the node, or bypasses the node.   PADM is distinct from conventional wavelength ADM (WADM) in that it  can handle traffic on a packet-by-packet basis.  In the application  of PADM to optical data networking, pseudo-time division multiple  access (TDMA) and rate-controlled asynchronous access are proposed.   The analyses and their numerical simulations of the performances are presented.  The simulation results demonstrate low packet-loss  probability.  Their optical implementations are also demonstrated, in which exploit parallel photonic label processing shows the  applicability of proposed optical data networking in an  ultrahigh-speed regime.  35 Refs.

Title: Fair blind threshold signatures based on discrete logarithm
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a group-oriented lair blind (t, n)  threshold signature scheme based on the discrete logarithm problem.   By the scheme, any t out of n signers in a group can represent the  group to sign fair blind threshold signatures, which can be used in  anonymous e-cash systems.  Since blind signature schemes provide  perfect unlinkability, such e-cash systems can be misused by  criminals, e.g. to safely obtain a ransom or to launder money.  Our  scheme allows the judge (or the government) to deliver information  allowing anyone of the t signers to link his view of the protocol  and the message-signature pair.  In our scheme, the size of a fair  blind threshold signature is the same as that of an individual fair  blind signature and the signature verification process is simplified by means of a group public key.  The security of our scheme relies on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithm.  25 Refs.

Title: Simplified design approach of reliable transparent optical networks
Abstract: Transparent optical networks will play an important role in the near  future.  The aim of this work is to provide a simplified design  approach how to utilize the new feature "optical transparency" in  WDM based optical networks.  Therefore optical nodes and transmission links are characterized and a set of simplified parameters and rules describing the transparent sub-networks is presented.  In this way  the complexity originating from physical constraints is reduced  substantially, simplifying the management of these optical networks  and the physical parameters which will be implemented in the routing protocols.  This contribution is a compendium of results of the BMBF  KomNet project in the field of optical networks optimisation.  11  Refs.

Title: PODOS - The design and implementation of a performance oriented Linux cluster
Abstract: PODOS is a performance oriented distributed operating system being  developed to harness the performance capabilities of a  cluster-computing environment.  In order to address the growing  demand for performance, we are designing a distributed operating  system (DOS) that can utilize the computing potential of a number of systems.  Earlier clustering approaches have traditionally stressed  more on resource sharing or reliability and have given lesser  priority to performance.  PODOS adds just four new components to the  existing Linux operating system to make it distributed.  These  components are a Communication Manager (CM), a PODOS Distributed  File System (PDFS), a Resource Manager (RM), and Global Interprocess Communication (GIPC).  This paper addresses the design and  implementation of the various components of the PODOS system. copy  2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.  15 Refs.

Title: Firewall-based intrusion detection system
Abstract: A network intrusion detection system (IDS) based on firewall was  described.  This system may solve the problem of the traditional IDS  which is lack of the active access control online.  In this model,  time-varying data packets are captured on data link layer, and then  filtered according to the security policy.  Meanwhile, the captured  IP packets are reduced to summary events by the event engine to  represent the important attributes.  After that, these events are  transferred to the intrusion detection module to make intrusion  analysis.  Statistics-based intrusion detection and Naive-Bayes  algorithm were used.  The prototype system based on the model was  implemented and tested in the real network environment.  The system  is good at detecting and controlling the network intrusions with  statistical features in nature.  9 Refs.

Title: Bluetooth wireless technology in the home
Abstract: The Bluetooth trademark * wireless technology is a cable replacement  technology that exploits the wireless interconnectivity that is  possible with radio.  Bluetooth chips are already available and early applications include cordless connections from mobile phones to  laptop computers and wireless headsets.  Even if only 10% of mobile  phones and computers were to incorporate Bluetooth chips, then the  technology would achieve the critical mass necessary for chip prices to fall below dollar 5 and for the standard to become firmly  established in the market-place.  It is expected that Bluetooth  products will be present in the home, where applications will  include: conversion of the humble cellphone to a short-range  cordless handset; providing a link from a PC to the Internet; home  automation and cable replacement; toys and white goods.  This paper  introduces the Bluetooth wireless technology and its applications  and provides a concise description of its air interface and protocol stack.  9 Refs.

Title: Integration of voice and data over multi-slot reservation multiple  access protocol and its performance analysis
Abstract: A multi-slot reservation multiple access protocol is proposed in this paper, which can integrate voice and data services efficiently.   Under the condition of giving high priority to voice terminals are  allowed to reserve multiple information slots in consecutive time  frames.  The protocol is analyzed by embedded Markov process, from  which some important performance measures such as voice packet loss  rate, average channel access delay of data messages and system  throughput are formulated.  The research results indicate that,  compared with IPRMA and NC-IPRMA, the protocol can support much  higher equivalent data terminal rate, and within a large extent of  traffic loads, the maximum system throughput can be reached.  11  Refs.

Title: Cellular network management goals and data-centric solutions
Abstract: In this article we elaborate on the management goals of  next-generation cellular networks and describe how data-centric  solutions can meet these goals.  In a data-centric solution, operator applications act on a database representation of the cellular  network.  Network operations are invoked as a consequence to database changes, and the network, in turn, feeds the database with data such as network event notifications.  The data-centric approach allows a  focus on data as it is specified by the business needs of network  management.  This approach is augmented with data independence to  assure consistent and flexible access of the data environment  through the use of a common data interface.  The data-centric design  is contrasted with an application-centric design, and we conclude by providing suggestions on how application interface components can  augment a data-centric network management solution.  14 Refs.

Title: Secure remote access from office to home
Abstract: When accessing IP-ready appliances at home from a remote site,  security is a major concern.  In this report we address the seemingly common scenario of accessing IP-ready appliances behind a home  firewall from a remote PC within a corporate intranet.  The scenario  reveals the complex nature of secure remote access.  Various IP  tunneling technologies can provide secure remote access without  sacrificing the ubiquitous accessibility of the Internet; however,  the problem of multiple authentication processes is evident in the  framework.  Digital certificate technology can simplify the  authentication process required to establish multiple IP tunnels.   However, IP tunneling technologies do not scale well, and become  infeasible if the number of firewalls to traverse increases.   Scalability and end-to-end security requirements call for the  deployment of authenticated firewall traversal methods that use  minimal or no IP tunnels.  This article describes a  meet-in-the-middle network model as a simple and practical method.   10 Refs.

Title: Internet facsimile as an internet office appliance
Abstract: The Internet's emergence as a worldwide digital infrastructure has  dramatically encouraged a market for communications-oriented  appliances, such as mobile phones, personal assistants,  network-enabled games, interactive television, Internet telephony,  and Internet facsimile.  The marketplace is developing rapidly, along with specialized Internet-based "linking" services to connect these  devices.  Generally two different technical approaches are being  explored for these services.  One uses classic Internet technology,  such as e-mail or the World Wide Web; the other incorporates unique  standards, often derived from earlier non-Internet specifications.   This article explores efforts to create Internet facsimile  appliances, contrasting them with devices for Internet telephony.   Efforts at Internet facsimile have produced two different sets of  standards.  Store-and-forward Internet facsimile is specialized as a  profile of classic Internet mail.  Real-time Internet facsimile uses  a specialized protocol.  9 Refs.

Abstract: This article describes problems associated with remotely accessing  networked appliances (e.g., from the Internet).  Networked appliances are widely viewed as the "next wave" of devices on the Internet.  We  discuss some possible uses for networked appliances and the  requirements for communicating with them.  We present details of a  solution to meet these communication requirements based on the IETF  Session Initiation Protocol.  In addition, we discuss the rationale  for our approach and reasons other approaches were not adopted.  An  example of the use of SIP in this domain is presented to illustrate  how the solution can be used.  We conclude with outstanding  challenges and reiterate advantages of this approach.  10 Refs.

Title: Mobile communication in power distribution application
Abstract: This paper investigates how to interface the wireless application  protocol architecture to the SCADA system running distributed  network protocol (DNP) in a power process plant.  DNP is a  well-developed protocol to be applied in the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system but the system control centre and  Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) are presently connected through local  area network.  The conditions in a process plant are harsh and the  site is remote.  Resources for data communication are difficult to  obtain under these conditions, thus, a wireless channel  communication through a mobile phone is practical and efficient in a process plant environments.  Since the mobile communication  industries and the public have a strong interest in the WAP  technology application in mobile phone network and the WAP  Application Programming Interface (API) in power industry  applications is one of the area requires extensive investigation.  10 Refs.

Title: Adaptive protocol relay capability with allowable delay of media  transmission
Abstract: Allowable delays In multi-media transmission are an important factor  for media synchronization.  Automatic repeat request (ARQ) is n very  popular protocol for error corrections.  However, long propagation  delays and high packet error-rates make long total packet delays.  If the received packet has a longer delay than allowable delay then it  will be lost.  This loss reduces the quality of the multi-media  applications.  To solve this problem, an adaptive protocol relay  capability is proposed.  Having this capability allows the protocol  to be adaptively terminated at the relay nodes.  However, the error  correction between the protocol relay nodes still requires a small  delay.  We analyze the relationship between the protocol relay  capability and the total loss of media transmission with allowable  delay.  Also, the criteria for this adaptive protocol relay is  described.  2 Refs.

Title: Queue management of RIO to achieve high throughput and low delay
Abstract: We have focused on the RIO queueing mechanism in statistical  bandwidth allocation service, which uses AF-PHB.  We have studied the parameterization of RIO to achieve both high throughput and low  delay.  We were able to parameterize RIO for that purpose in terms of both min  th and maxp used in dropping "Out" packets.  Furthermore, we have also examined the parameterization regarding EWMA (Exponential  Weighted Moving Average), i.e., weight factor W//q//o//u//t//, and  have shown that dropping "Out" packets should depend upon the queue  length without much delay unlike in RED.  From our simulation  results, we could see that our parameterization provided high  throughput performance and also limited the queue length in a narrow range very well.  10 Refs.

Title: DSP: A MAC scheme with double-side scheduling for APON
Abstract: MAC schemes for ATM-based Passive Optical Network(APON) mostly adopt  single-side scheduling in which only Optical Line Termination (OLT)  schedules upstream access order for Optical Network Units (ONUs).  In this paper, we propose a MAC scheme called Double-side Scheduling  Protocol (DSP) in which both OLT and ONUs participate in scheduling  process.  The proposed MAC scheme conforms to the ITU-T  recommendation G.983.1.  For the proposed MAC scheme, we present  grant field format, minislot format, divided slot format, and  scheduling algorithm.  Through computer simulations, we find out that the Cell Delay Variation (CDV) of real-time services can be improved remarkably using fewer overhead slots than that of MAC schemes  adopting CDV control algorithm.  9 Refs.

Title: Smooth loss with variability smoothing factor to increase bandwidth  utilization
Abstract: As the rapid growth of the Internet data streaming the TCP and UDP  protocols could not efficiently utilize and share bandwidth for the  data streaming.  There are many techniques to improve a transmission  data stream to archive multimedia data.  The adaptive transmission  control using smoothed loss is a technique that controls a  transmission rate to an appropriate network condition.  This paper  improves this technique by using a variability smoothing factor  which can improve a transmission rate in the whole transmission.   Simulated number are use to study an adaptive behavior of the  adaptive transmission control procedure.  The results of experiment  shows that a rate adaptive control procedure can increase a  transmission rate by using a variability smoothing factor.  6 Refs.

Title: ASA: The active service architecture for new internet
Abstract: Because support of new distributed multimedia applications are an  important challenge for the Internet Service Providers, a lot of  works are under progress for enhancing the Internet architecture.   Thus, internet service architectures based upon new protocols have  been proposed.  While a new generation of internet ma be developed  from these proposals, the problem of the deployment of these new  technologies becomes of a prime importance.  In this article we  attempt to provide a solution to the internet evolution process by  means of a new concept, the active service architecture, that is  based on the new technology of active networking.  The concept of  activity in ASA architecture is presented, specification of the  nodes are given and an experimentation of active service is shown.   10 Refs.

Title: Mobile IP**2
Abstract: Internet traffic is growing in an exponential rate and more and more  people's lives are tightly coupled with Internet.  The ability to  keep connected with Interact while on the move is highly desired in  an increasingly mobile environment.  In this proposal, we present a  mean for ubiquitous network access for consumers in both wired and  wireless environments.  We introduce the concept of  multiple-interface/multiple-connection to support high-speed handoff and seamless roaming between different networks (wired and  wireless).  This is implemented by improving current mobile IP  concept, extending existing IP (specifically CMIP and ARP) functions and enhancing current PC device drivers and software.  The mobility  that supported by this proposal is based on layer 3 functionality  under the OSI protocol layer definition (physical layer and link  layer are assumed to be supported already).  6 Refs.

Title: Routing reliability analysis of partially disjoint paths
Abstract: Alternative paths may significantly improve routing reliability in an IP network.  One application of this technique is to enhance the  reliability of the popular Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing  protocol.  In our proposed Reliable OSPF (ROSPF) routing protocol,  one primary path and two alternate backup paths are deployed for  data transmission.  As expected, the number of shared links and  routers among the three paths dominates the reliability of the  routing connection between two routers.  The calculation of routing  reliability of multiple paths is very important in alternate  path-finding algorithms.  To solve this problem, we use the Venn  Diagram model to analyze the overall failure probability of three  partially disjoint paths and to understand how the double- and  triple shared links affect the routing reliability.  General  mathematical formulas to calculate the failure probability are also  obtained.  5 Refs.

Title: A key transport protocol based on secret sharing an application to  conditional access systems
Abstract: In today's digital world, multimedia content is delivered to homes  via the Internet, satellite, terrestrial and cable networks.   Scrambling is a common approach used by conditional access systems  to prevent unauthorized access to audio/visual data.  The  descrambling keys are securely distributed to the receivers in the  same transmission channel.  Their protection is an important part of  the key management problem.  Although public-key cryptography  provides a viable solution, alternative methods are sought for  economy and efficiency.  This paper presents a key transport protocol based on secret sharing.  It eliminates the need for a cipher, yet  combines the advantages of symmetric and public-key ciphers.  14  Refs.

Title: A cost-efficient signaling protocol for mobility application part  (MAP) in IMT-2000 systems
Abstract: An efficient signaling protocol for mobility application part (MAP)  is essential to mobility support when mobile terminals roam between  different networks in next generation wireless systems such as  IMT-2000.  In this paper, a new signaling protocol is proposed to  reduce the overhead caused by mobility management, alleviating  network load and consumption of network resources.  Moreover, the new protocol effectively reduces the latency of call delivery and call  loss rate due to crossing wireless systems with different standards  and signaling protocols.  Instead of performing location registration after a mobile user arrives at the new system, the mobile user is  required to update its location information prior to its reaching  the boundary of two systems.  Results in this study demonstrate that  the new protocol yields significant benefits in terms of reducing  signaling costs, delays, and call loss rates.  19 Refs.

Title: IP paging service for mobile hosts
Abstract: In wireless networks, mobile hosts must update the network with their current location in order to get packets delivered.  Paging  facilitates efficient power management at the mobile host by  allowing the host to update the network less frequently at the cost  of providing the network with only approximate location information.  The network determines the exact location of a mobile host through  paging before delivering packets destined to the mobile host.  In  this paper, we propose the concept of paging as an IP service.  IP  paging enables a common infrastructure and protocol to support the  different wireless interfaces such as CDMA, GPRS, wireless LAN,  avoiding the duplication of several application layer paging  implementations and the inter-operability issues that exists today.   We present the design, implementation, and detailed qualitative and  quantitative evaluation, using measurements and simulation, of three IP-based paging protocols for mobile hosts.  25 Refs.

Title: SPINS: Security protocols for sensor networks
Abstract: As sensor networks edge closer towards wide-spread deployment,  security issues become a central concern.  So far, much research has  focused on making sensor networks feasible and useful, and has not  concentrated on security.  We present a suite of security building  blocks optimized for resource-constrained environments and wireless  communication.  SPINS has two secure building blocks: SNEP and  muTESLA.  SNEP provides the following important baseline security  primitives: Data confidentiality, two-party data authentication, and data freshness.  A particularly hard problem is to provide efficient  broadcast authentication, which is an important mechanism for sensor networks. muTESLA is a new protocol which provides authenticated  broadcast for severely resource-constrained environments.  We  implemented the above protocols, and show that they are practical  even on minimal hardware: the performance of the protocol suite  easily matches the data rate of our network.  Additionally, we  demonstrate that the suite can be used for building higher level  protocols.  45 Refs.

Title: Brief announcement: A framework for semantic reasoning about  byzantine quorum systems
Abstract: We have defined a class of shared variables called TS-variables that  includes those implemented by the various Byzantine quorum system  constructions of Malkhi and Reiter, and developed a number of  definitions and theorems enabling us to reason about these variables abstractly.  Using these tools, we have reduced the problem of  Lamport's atomic semantics for such variables to the simpler problem of regular semantics.  We discuss the fact that both these problems  have remained stubbornly difficult to solve for some types of  Byzantine quorum system variables (notably masking quorum system  variables) by showing that they are not solvable by traditional  approaches in an asynchronous environment.  Finally, for such  variables we define the notion of pseudoregular and pseudoatomic  semantics, and state briefly that a similar reduction holds for  these concepts.  4 Refs.

Title: Fast recovery of MPLS paths
Abstract: A new general theory about restoration of network paths is first  introduced.  The theory pertains to restoration of shortest paths in  a network following failure, e.g., we prove that a shortest path in  a network after removing k edges is the concatenation of at most k + 1 shortest paths in the original network.  The theory is then  combined with efficient path concatenation techniques in MPLS  (multi-protocol label switching), to achieve powerful schemes for  restoration in MPLS based networks.  We thus transform MPLS into a  flexible and robust method for forwarding packets in a network.   Finally, the different schemes suggested are evaluated  experimentally on three large networks (a large ISP, the AS graph of the Internet, and the full Internet topology).  These experiments  demonstrate that the restoration schemes perform well in actual  topologies.  13 Refs.

The transmission mechanism and realizing method of  Priority Transfer Protocol (PTP) are founded and discussed.  Lastly,  the performance parameters and running results of the hybrid model  are analyzed in the different environment.  9 Refs.

Title: Deterministic corba ORB (DORB) for distributed real-time applications
Abstract: In this paper we propose an alternative approach for dealing with  distributed real-time applications in CORBA environments.  Our  approach, called deterministic CORBA ORB (DORB), provides the basis  for implementing distributed real-time applications on LANs (Local  Area Networks) and the Internet.  DORB uses a deterministic mechanism for the refreshment of client stubs.  It is especially adapted for  handling periodic tasks.  DORB is based on a time-bounded atomic  multicast protocol and a statistical observer component for making  estimations on the transmission delays of the network.  Its most  important feature is to guarantee the determinism, in a  bounded-time, of the entire end-to-end path of a real-time  client-server interaction (transmission delays and server processing time).  9 Refs.

Title: Quality of service support over multi-service wireless Internet links
Abstract: Internet application performance over wireless links is  disappointing, since wireless impairments adversely affect higher  protocol layers.  In order to address these problems without global  protocol modifications, we examine link layer enhancement schemes.   Simulations show that different schemes work best for different  applications.  We have thus developed a multi-service link layer  architecture that simultaneously enhances the performance of diverse applications by supporting multiple link mechanisms concurrently.   Simulations show that our approach dramatically improves  performance.  We present various ways of embedding this architecture  into the Internet, thus allowing applications to select themselves  the appropriate trade-off between throughput, loss and delay. copy  2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Expanding confidence in network simulations
Abstract: Networking engineers increasingly depend on simulation to design and  delploy complex, heterogeneous networks.  Similarly, networking  researchers increasingly depend on simulation to investigate the  behaviour and performance of new protocol designs.  Despite such  widespread use of simulation, today there exists little common  understanding of the degree of validation required for various  applications of simulation.  Further, only limited knowledge exists  regarding the effectiveness of known validation techniques.  To  investigate these issues, in May 1999 DARPA and NIST organized a  workshop on Network Simulation Validation.  This article reports on  discussions and consensus about issues that arose at the workshop.   We describe best current practices for validating simulations and  For validating TCP models across various simulation environments.  We also discuss interactions between scale and model validation and  future challenges for the community.  9 Refs.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore techniques to detect Byzantine server  failures in asynchronous replicated data services.  Our goal is to  detect arbitrary failures of data servers in a system where each  client accesses the replicated data at only a subset (quorum) of  servers in each operation.  In such a system, some correct servers  can be out-of-date after a write and can therefore, return values  other than the most up-to-date value in response to a client's read  request, thus complicating the task of determining the number of  faulty servers in the system at any point in time.  We initiate the  study of detecting server failures in this context, and propose two  statistical approaches for estimating the risk posed by faulty  servers based on responses to read requests.  21 Refs.

Title: Further evolution of the GSM/EDGE radio access network
Abstract: The next evolutionary step for the GSM/EDGE cellular system is a  standardization of enhancements that yield greater alignment with  UMTS/UTRAN, thus further evolving GSM toward third-generation  wireless systems.  These enhancements are currently being specified  for the GSM/EDGE radio access network (GERAN) in coming releases of  the 3GPP standard.  By using the EDGE high-speed transmission  technique, and combining it with a GPRS radio link interface (and  further enhancing it), GERAN provides efficient support for all QoS  service classes defined for UMTS.  Thus, GERAN can support a range of new applications, including IP multimedia.  GERAN is also adopting  the UMTS architecture-through its support of the Iu interface, GERAN connects to the same UMTS core network as UTRAN.  6 Refs.

Title: SyncML - Getting the mobile Internet in sync
Abstract: Today's business tools-desktop computer, laptop computer, personal  digital assistant, mobile phone, and the applications that run on  them-have made it much easier to access, use, and store a wealth of  business data at the office or while on the move.  The trouble is  keeping calendars, address books, to-do lists, e-mail and other  personal information management (PIM) data current across this  variety of tools.  The quest for seamless synchronization led to the  development of several proprietary solutions to the problem.   Unfortunately, most businesspeople do not tend to use applications  and tools from a single vendor for all their daily communications  and PIM needs.  Founded in February 2000, the SyncML initiative is a  universal standard for synchronization across networks, devices, and applications from any vendor.  The initiative is supported by  Ericsson, IBM-Lotus, Matsushita (Panasonic), Motorola/Starfish,  Nokia, Openwave and Symbian.

Title: Statistical bandwidth sharing: A study of congestion at flow level
Abstract: In this paper we study the statistics of the realized throughput of  elastic document transfers, accounting for the way network bandwidth is shared dynamically between the randomly varying number of  concurrent flows.  We first discuss the way TCP realizes statistical  bandwidth sharing, illustrating essential properties by means of  packet level simulations.  Mathematical flow level models based on  the theory of stochastic networks are then proposed to explain the  observed behavior.  A notable result is that first order performance  (e.g., mean throughput) is insensitive with respect both to the flow size distribution and the flow arrival process, as long as  "sessions" arrive according to a Poisson process.  Perceived  performance is shown to depend most significantly on whether demand  at flow level is less than or greater than available capacity.  The  models provide a key to understanding the effectiveness of  techniques for congestion management and service differentiation.  30 Refs.

Title: Hash-based IP traceback
Abstract: The design of the IP protocol makes it difficult to reliably identify the originator of an IP packet.  Even in the absence of any  deliberate attempt to disguise a packet's origin, wide-spread packet forwarding techniques such as NAT and encapsulation may obscure the  packet's true source.  Techniques have been developed to determine  the source of large packet flows, but, to date, no system has been  presented to track individual packets in an efficient, scalable  fashion.  We present a hash-based technique for IP traceback that  generates audit trails for traffic within the network, and can trace the origin of a single IP packet delivered by the network in the  recent past.  We demonstrate that the system is effective,  space-efficient (requiring approximately 0.5% of the link capacity  per unit time in storage), and implementable in current or  next-generation routing hardware.  We present both analytic and  simulation results showing the system's effectiveness.  25 Refs.

Title: Remote management of next-generation PBXs via the Internet: Security  issues
Abstract: In the near future, traditional PBXs will be replaced by new IP-based generations of such equipment, which will be integrated in  businesses' data networks.  This development introduces new  possibilities for arranging remote management of PBXs, a service  offered by most present-day telcos.  Specifically, using the Internet as a communication means for this purpose will become feasible,  which is attractive from a cost and flexibility point of view.   Unfortunately however, such a scheme introduces various security  issues, since the Internet is known to be a highly insecure  environment.  This paper provides an overview of relevant threats and risks and proposes solutions to achieve an appropriate situation.  13 Refs.

Title: Reflections on migration scenarios of voice networks towards  next-generation networks for incumbent operators
Abstract: Today many operators are considering the migration of their existing  voice networks towards a combined voice and data network.  The  drivers for this migration are the economic and marketing benefits  in comparison to the existing infrastructure.  The new converged  voice and IP-based services for residential and business customers  are a driving factor as well.  The problems for incumbent operators  having in mind to migrate their installed PSTN-ISDN network with  well-working services are located in various areas like: voice  quality of service for packet-based networks, network management,  national and international interconnection contracts, regulatory  aspects, numbering plan, number portability.  The questions are: how  to migrate the existing hardware, in which hierarchical level to  start the migration, and which technologies are available.  This  paper addresses next-generation network approaches, considering  technical, regulatory and commercial aspects.

Title: Targeting Ada95/DSA for distributed simulation of multi-protocol  communication networks
Abstract: This paper describes the use of Ada95/DSA as middleware for modeling  network's entities into distributed objects which can be used for  both distributed execution and simulation without transformation of  the model.  First, general issues of simulation of network's entities are briefly presented.  Then, the paper shows how DSA features are  used to abstract these entities in a manner as they can be executed  or simulated on a cluster of workstations.  The DSA based model of  distributed simulation is built on a combination of two kinds of  classes: the first one support general purpose of distributed  objects computing and the second deal with the development of  distributed network elements.  To illustrate the feasibility of this  approach, a partial implementation of classes that have been used to model routers running a subset of border gateway protocol (BGP) is  presented.  19 Refs.

Title: Security awareness in service discovery for multimedia collaboration
Abstract: Multimedia capable devices for professional and private use grow  digital these days.  With the advent of short-range wireless  communication capabilities, these devices gain new potentials such  as enabling seamless collaboration within groups of devices.  As a  side effect of these technologies, new problems emerge, spatially in the area of security.  This paper focuses on security issues to form  (peer)groups among these devices.  Our primary goal is to establish  security awareness via the service discovery process.  We show that  the combination of the pure Internet Protocol and today's state of  the art service discovery protocols lack the necessary features for  solving the problem described.  We introduce a novel design of a  service discovery system as a solution for security aware ad-hoc  usage.  13 Refs.

Title: Infopipes for composing distributed information flows
Abstract: Building applications that process information flows on existing  middleware platforms is difficult, because of the variety of QoS  requirements, the need for application-specific protocols, and the  poor match of the commonly used abstraction of remote invocations to streaming.  We propose Infopipes as a high-level abstraction for  building blocks that handle information flows.  The ability to query  individual Infopipe elements as well as composite Infopipes for  properties of supported flows enables QoS-aware configuration.   Similarly to local protocol frameworks Infopipes provide a flexible  infrastructure for configuring communication services from modules,  but unlike protocols the abstraction uniformly includes the entire  pipeline from source to sink, possibly across process and node  boundaries.  14 Refs.

Title: Equilibrium point analysis of the binary exponential backoff  algorithm
Abstract: A Markovian model of the backoff algorithm used in the slotted  1-persistent carrier sense multiple access/collision detection  (CSMA/CD) access protocol is developed in order to analyze the  performance of such a network.  Due to its complexity, the existing  models of the CSMA/CD protocol do not incorporate the effects of the backoff algorithm.  In this work, we developed an approximate  Markovian model of the system with a multidimensional state vector  and we used the equilibrium point analysis technique in order to  analyze the model.  The throughput-delay characteristics and the  stability behavior of the system are extracted, which conform the  simulation results and the predictions of other theoretical models  presented in the literature. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: A case study in abstraction using E-LOTOS and the FireWire
Abstract: The proposed ISO standard Enhancements to LOTOS (E-LOTOS) is used to  describe the leader election protocol of the IEEE 1394 serial  multimedia bus ("FireWire").  The E-LOTOS language facilitates  descriptions at several levels of abstraction, therefore a broad  understanding of the protocol at an abstract level can be gained  before adding more complexity and concrete detail.  A secondary aim  is to illustrate some of the novel features of E-LOTOS, particularly those for describing real time and parallelism.  The specification  process is described in some detail, paying particular attention to  the general applicability of E-LOTOS to protocol description.   Verification techniques and tools for E-LOTOS are considered, and  comparisons are drawn between E-LOTOS and other similar formal  methods. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: The PROFIBUS formal specification: A comparison between two FDTs
Abstract: Formal description languages, like ESTELLE, Language Temporary Of  Ordering Specification (LOTOS) or Specification Description Language (SDL), allow us to specify complex system requirements in an  ambiguities free and complete way.  The choice of what formal  language to use in a particular system specification must be taken a priori by the system designer.  It would be useful to have  comparative information about systems described with some of these  languages, to know which one would fit better to that system.  The  literature published on this topic compares too simple systems.  This paper deals with this aspect and compares the formal specification  of the PROcess FIeld BUS (PROFIBUS) communications protocol in both  languages LOTOS and SDL. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Assessment of distribution transformers using loss capitalization  formulae
Abstract: Electrical utilities are increasingly required to operate their  networks more efficiently and to reduce the total real running costs of equipment.  The additional requirements to meet remote global  commitments such as managing emissions of green-house gases in  conformance with various protocols make design of electrical  distribution systems and the selection of equipment more complex.   The widely used method in selecting the most economical distribution transformer design is simple capitalization of transformer losses.  A number of Australian authorities currently use one formula for the  evaluation of total operating costs for all distribution  transformers under all service and loading conditions.  This paper  presents the analysis of that method and recommends new solutions  for assessment of distribution transformers suitable for particular  applications in different types of electrical distribution networks.  6 Refs.

Title: Performance of combined ARQ with SR and GBN for broadband wireless  systems on a 40 GHz band radio channel
Abstract: Mobile wireless communication systems for the fourth generation are  being explored.  The key is broadband and high-quality communications to support multimedia services, and the use of millimeter or  centimeter-wave band and ARQ is being considered to realize such  communications.  In this article we propose a new ARQ scheme which is combined with SR and GBN, and confirm that this new scheme is proper for broadband communication systems.  We implemented our ARQ function with hardware and evaluated the ARQ performance: throughput, cell  loss rate, and cell transfer delay on a pseudo Rayleigh fading  channel.  In addition, we evaluated ARQ performance on an actual 40  GHz band radio channel.  Through the evaluation, we found it  necessary to design an ARQ scheme in accordance with system  requirements, and our combined ARQ satisfies this required  condition.  8 Refs.

Title: Dynamic lightpath establishment in wavelength-routed WDM networks
Abstract: In wavelength-routed WDM networks, a control mechanism is required to set up and take down all-optical connections.  Upon the arrival of a  connection request, this mechanism must be able to select a route,  assign a wavelength to the connection, and configure the appropriate optical switches in the network.  The mechanism must also be able to  provide updates to reflect which wavelengths are currently being  used on each link so that nodes may make informed routing decisions.  In this work, we review control mechanisms proposed in the  literature.  We also investigate and compare two different  distributed control mechanisms for establishing all-optical  connections in a wavelength-routed WDM network: an approach based on link-state routing, and one based on distance-vector routing.  11  Refs.

Title: Event error control codes and their applications
Abstract: Burst error detection codes and cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes  are generalized to event-error detection codes, which are useful in  various noisy channels.  A systematic linear block code is  constructed that detects any event error from an arbitrary list of  event errors.  The result is generalized to detection and correction  of multiple event errors.  Bounds are found on the minimum number of  redundant bits needed to construct such codes.  It is shown that,  under certain conditions, the linear code construction is optimal.   Various applications are discussed, where there is a Markov source  or a Markov channel.  It is argued that the codes described herein  can be employed either as error detection codes, or as  distance-enhancing codes when complete decoders are applied.   Specific examples covered in this correspondence include hybrid  automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems, intersymbol interference  (ISI) channels, and Gilbert channels.  16 Refs.

Title: An improved UDP protocol for video transmission over  Internet-to-wireless networks
Abstract: Packet video will become a significant portion of emerging and future wireless/Internet traffic.  However, network congestion and wireless  channel error yields tremendous packet loss and degraded video  quality In this paper, we propose a new complete user datagram  protocol (CUDP), which utilizes channel error information obtained  from the physical and link layers to assist error recovery at the  packet level.  We propose several maximal distance separable (MDS)  code-based packet level error control coding schemes and derive  analytical formulas to estimate the equivalent video frame loss for  different versions of user datagram protocol (UDP).  We validate the  proposed packet coding and CUDP protocol using MPEG-coded video  under various Internet packet loss and wireless channel profiles.   Theoretic and simulation results show that the video quality can be  substantially improved by utilizing the frame error information at  UDP and application layer.  20 Refs.

Abstract: This paper addresses the resource allocation problem for multiple  media streaming over the Internet.  First, we present an end-to-end  transport architecture for multimedia streaming over the Internet.   Second, we propose a new multimedia streaming TCP-friendly protocol  (MSTFP), which combines forward estimation of network conditions  with information feedback control to optimally track the network  conditions.  Third, we propose a novel resource allocation scheme to  adapt media rate to the estimated network bandwidth using each  media's rate-distortion function under various network conditions.   By dynamically allocating resources according to network status and  media characteristics, we improve the end-to-end quality of services (QoS), Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our  proposed schemes.  25 Refs.

Title: Theory of latency-insensitive design
Abstract: The theory of latency-insensitive design is presented as the  foundation of a new correct-by-construction methodology to design  complex systems by assembling intellectual property components.   Latency-insensitive designs are synchronous distributed systems and  are realized by composing functional modules that exchange data on  communication channels according to an appropriate protocol.  The  protocol works on the assumption that the modules are stallable, a  weak condition to ask them to obey.  The goal of the protocol is to  guarantee that latency-insensitive designs composed of functionally  correct modules behave correctly independently of the channel  latencies.  This allows us to increase the robustness of a design  implementation because any delay variations of a channel can be  "recovered" by changing the channel latency while the overall system functionality remains unaffected.  As a consequence, an important  application of the proposed theory is represented by the  latency-insensitive methodology to design large digital integrated  circuits by using deep submicrometer technologies.  44 Refs.

Title: Holonic assembly system with Plug and Produce
Abstract: An assembly system based on holonic concept has been newly installed.  The system consists of three manipulators, one belt-conveyor and two warehouses.  The system assembles several parts into a product.  Its  sequences are planned by negotiation among the assembly devices by  means of contract net protocol.  Thus, even though the parts are  supplied at different warehouses, the system can generate a sequence of transportation automatically.  Utilizing the characteristics of  distributed autonomous systems, a new concept Plug and Produce is  proposed.  A device can be installed easily and then immediately  start to work.  This system has high robustness against the  reconfiguration and sudden changes of products.  Experiments were  made for two kinds of assembly tasks and verified the efficiency of  the system. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  7  Refs.

Title: Securing e-business applications using smart cards
Abstract: As the Internet is used increasingly as a platform for business  transactions, security becomes a primary issue for Internet  applications.  Some applications are too sensitive for software-only  security mechanisms.  Higher levels of protection can be achieved  with smart-card-based authentication schemes and transaction  protocols.  In this paper, we provide examples of typical banking  applications implemented with smart cards using symmetrical (DES)  and asymmetrical (RSA) cryptography.  We present a pure Java**T**M  architecture for such applications, which is intended for use on  standard Web application servers and client devices enabled for Web  browsing and the Java language.  It employs applets on the client  side to access smart cards via the OpenCard Framework.  The applets  communicate with authentication servlets or application servlets on  the server side and act as a mediator between the smart card and the application logic on the server.  21 Refs.

Title: Study of MPLS stream merging over ATM
Abstract: In Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), VC-merging enables multi IP  flows to be mapped onto the same VC label if they have the same  destination.  It provides a scalable solution for the network growth.  This paper studies several approaches proposed and analyzes their  main problems, such as the additional buffering, protocol overhead,  delay etc., which make the provision of QoS difficult to achieve.   With the help of re-coding two bits inside the head of ATM cell,  this paper put forward a new MPLS VC-merge capable scheduler.  It  allows cells to be interleaved with one another and be uniquely  identified.  The new scheduler has several properties: (1) simple to  implement; (2) requiring no extra buffer and protocol overhead; (3)  maintaining per-flow QoS.  However, it may introduce a minimal waste  of link bandwidth when utilization is low due to the approximately  GPS round robin scheduler it uses.  5 Refs.

Title: Performance improvement of ABT protocols with combined  bandwidth/buffer reservation
Abstract: ABT (ATM block transfer) is expected for effectively transferring  highly bursty data traffic in ATM networks.  In the past work, ABT/IT has been shown to be robust in that its performance is not much  affected by the propagation delay when compared with ABT/DT.   However, when the traffic load becomes heavy and/or when the number  of hop counts of the connection becomes large, the throughput of  ABT/IT is drastically decreased.  We then propose a new protocol,  Buffered-ABT/IT, which makes reservation on the buffer as well as  the bandwidth.  The approximate analysis method is developed for  buffered-ABT/IT.  Through numerical examples, we show that it can  improve the performance even in the above conditions compared with  the existing ABT protocols. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: An efficient polling MAC for wireless LANs
Abstract: Polling schemes are an important class of medium access control (MAC) protocols for wireless local area networks (WLANs).  A major drawback of these schemes is their inefficiency when only a small number of  mobile stations have packets to transmit.  This inefficiency is due  to the polling of mobile stations with no packets to transmit, which delays the transmissions of mobile stations with packets.  In this  paper, we suggest a new polling MAC which exploits the capture  phenomena and enables simultaneous polling and transmissions of  information packets.  Mathematical analysis and simulation results  show that the new MAC overcomes the above inefficiency considerably, and thus it is more efficient in the sense that it enables higher  throughput and a lower access delay.  For example, we show scenarios  in which the average access delay is reduced by about 30% and the  throughput increases by 66%-75%.  15 Refs.

Title: An adaptive FEC scheme for data traffic in wireless ATM networks
Abstract: In this paper, a new adaptive forward-error-correction scheme (AFEC)  is introduced at the link layer for TCP/IP data traffic in wireless  ATM networks.  The fading and interference in wireless links cause  high and variable error rates, as well as bursty errors.  The purpose of the AFEC scheme is to provide a dynamic error-control mechanism  by using the Reed-Solomon coding to protect the ATM cell payload, as well as the payload type indicator/cell loss priority fields in the  ATM cell header.  In order to enhance the error tolerance in cell  framing and correct delivery, the AFEC scheme functions within a new concept called LANET framing and addressing protection mechanisms.   The AFEC scheme has been validated using a simulation testbed of a  low-speed wireless ATM network.  18 Refs.

Title: Analysis and improvement of TCP congestion control mechanism based on global optimization model
Abstract: Network flow control is formulated as a global optimization problem  of user profit.  A general global optimization flow control model is  established.  This model combined with the stochastic model of TCP is used to study the global rate allocation characteristic of TCP.   Analysis shows when active queue management is used in network TCP  rates tend to be allocated to maximize the aggregate of a user  utility function U//s (called U//s fairness).  The TCP throughput  formula is derived.  An improved TCP congestion control mechanism is  proposed.  Simulations show its throughput is TCP friendly when  competing with existing TCP and its rate change is smoother.   Therefore, it is suitable to carry multimedia applications.  12 Refs.

Title: Supporting node mobility using mobile IPv6 in a LEO-satellite network
Abstract: This paper investigates supporting IPv6, the next generation IP in a  Teledesic-like low earth orbit (LEO) satellite backbone.  The network architecture consists of LEO satellites with intersatellite links,  gateway stations, standard terminals and mobile terminals.  This  network offers mobile data services like earth cellular networks.   Due to its enlarged addressing space, IPv6 is selected as the  network layer.  For routing IPv6 datagrams in this network, a  tunnelling approach is taken in which IPv6 datagrams from/to the  Internet are fragmented/reassembled into ATM-cell-like packets.  To  route these packets inside the LEO-constellation, we design a  unicast link-state routing algorithm in which the responsibilities  for routing are shared between the satellites and gateway stations.   For user mobility, Mobile IPv6 extended for paging the users in  standby mode is used.  The paper concludes with a presentation of  simulation results.  13 Refs.

Title: TCP-peach for satellite networks: Analytical model and performance  evaluation
Abstract: Current TCP protocols have low throughput performance in satellite  networks mainly due to the effects of long propagation delays and  high link error rates.  TCP-Peach is a new congestion control scheme  for satellite IP networks based on the use of low priority segments, called dummy segments.  The sender transmits dummy segments to probe  the availability of network resources.  Dummy segments are treated as low priority segments thus, they do not effect the throughput of  actual data segments.  In this paper, TCP-Peach is presented along  with its analytical model which is used to evaluate the throughput  performance.  Experiments show that TCP-Peach is robust to high link  error rates as well as long propagation delays, and outperforms  other TCP schemes for satellite networks.  20 Refs.

Title: On different models for packet flow in multistage interconnection  networks
Abstract: Multistage interconnection networks (MINs) have a number of  applications in many areas, for example in parallel computing  systems or high-speed communication networks.  In the paper we define Markov chains describing several models of packet flow through the  buffered MIN with a butterfly interconnection structure and 2  multiplied by 2 switching elements.  We develop a notation together  with a mathematical framework enabling to prove certain results  relating the models.  Moreover, we show that all considered Markov  chains are ergodic and discuss relationships between stationary  distributions.  The important novelty is that our approach is  compositional, which allows to keep the complexity of description of a very complicated network's behaviour on a reasonable and tractable level.  Considerations are mostly independent of specific network  topology and routing protocol, hence we expect our method to be  applicable also in other contexts for stochastic models of massively parallel systems.  25 Refs.

Abstract: Satellites are foreseen to be complementary to future terrestrial  networks in deploying multimedia communication systems.  The use of  geostationary multibeams and on-board processing provides a great  opportunity for the speedy deployment of real time services such as  IP telephony services over satellites.  The effects of IP telephony  transport over satellite channels have not been investigated in  detail.  The paper presents an overview of the VIP-TEN project  architecture and the VoIP measurement campaign over the EuroSkyWay  test-bed.  The results show that geostationary satellites can carry  VoIP traffic and offer a good quality service in terms of packet  loss and jitter, and medium to poor quality in terms of packet  delay.  The paper also analyses the delays in setting/joining audio  conferences and multicast group management over satellites.  9 Refs.

Title: Optimal packetisation of MPEG-4 using RTP over mobile networks
Abstract: The introduction of third-generation wireless networks should result  in real-time mobile video communications becoming a reality.   Delivery of such video is likely to be facilitated by the real-time  transport protocol (RTP).  Careful packetisation of the video data is necessary to ensure the optimal trade-off between channel  utilisation and error robustness.  Theoretical analyses for two basic schemes of MPEG-4 data encapsulation within RTP packets are  presented.  Simulations over a GPRS (general packet radio service)  network are used to validate the analysis of the most efficient  scheme.  Finally, a motion adaptive system for deriving MPEG-4 video  packet sizes is presented.  Further simulations demonstrate the  benefits of the adaptive system.  13 Refs.

Title: A generalized grid quorum strategy for k-mutual exclusion in  distributed systems
Abstract: In the problem of k-mutual exclusion, concurrent access to shared  resource or the critical section (CS) must be synchronized such that at any time at most k processes can access the CS.  In this paper, we propose a generalized grid quorum strategy for k-mutual exclusion,  which imposes a logical grid structure on the network.  The quorum  size is always equal to [(M+1)/(k+1)]  multiplied by [(N+1)/2] , where M is the  number of rows and N is the number of columns in a grid.  From our  performance study, we show that the generalized grid quorum strategy can provide a good performance in terms of the quorum size and the  availability. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Firewalls - Evolve or die
Abstract: Businesses have traditionally relied on perimeter firewalls to  enforce their security policy, However, perimeter controls do not  provide a comprehensive solution to secure a private network  connected to the Internet.  This paper describes how the dynamic  business environment and techniques, such as protocol tunnelling,  have leveraged the use of IP networks.  The use of these protocols  and techniques means that perimeter firewalls alone no longer  provide sufficient security.  IPsec network security is reviewed and  it is shown how its security services can be used to provide greater protection for the network by securing connections end to end.  The  paper also describes tools for firewall and VPN policy management  that address the problem of managing the overall security policy  with network implementations comprising multiple vendors' products.   Finally, the paper proposes a vision of how future secure virtual  networks will be established over existing infrastructures.  18 Refs.

Title: Attacks and solutions on strong-password authentication
Abstract: A password-based mechanism is the most widely used method of  authentication in distributed environments.  However, because people  are used to choosing easy-to-remember passwords, so-called  "weak-passwords," dictionary attacks on them can succeed.  The  techniques used to prevent dictionary attacks lead to a heavy  computational load.  Indeed, forcing people to use well-chosen  passwords, so-called "strong passwords," with the assistance of  tamper-resistant hardware devices can be regarded as another fine  authentication solution.  In this paper, we examine a recent  solution, the SAS protocol, and demonstrate that it is vulnerable to replay and denial of service attacks.  We also propose an Optimal  Strong-Password Authentication (OSPA) protocol that is secure  against stolen-verifier, replay, and denial of service attacks, and  minimizes computation, storage, and transmission overheads.  18 Refs.

Title: Cognitive radio for flexible mobile multimedia communications
Abstract: Wireless multimedia applications require significant bandwidth, some  of which will be provided by third-generation (3G) services.  Even  with substantial investment in 3G infrastructure, the radio spectrum allocated to 3G will be limited.  Cognitive radio offers a mechanism  for the flexible pooling of radio spectrum using a new class of  protocols called formal radio etiquettes.  This approach could expand the bandwidth available for conventional uses (e.g., police, fire  and rescue) and extend the spatial coverage of 3G in a novel way.   Cognitive radio is a particular extension of software radio that  employs model-based reasoning about users, multimedia content, and  communications context.  This paper characterizes the potential  contributions of cognitive radio to spectrum pooling and outlines an initial framework for formal radio-etiquette protocols.  13 Refs.

Title: Combined tuning of RF power and medium access control for WLANs
Abstract: Mobile communication systems, such as handhelds and laptops, still  suffer from short operation time due to limited battery capacity.  We exploit the approach of protocol harmonization to extend the time  between battery charges in mobile devices using an IEEE 802.11  network interface.  Many known energy saving mechanisms only  concentrate on a single protocol layer while others only optimize  the receiving phase by on/off switching.  We show, that energy saving is also possible during the sending process.  This is achieved by a  combined tuning of the data link control and physical layer.  In  particular, harmonized operation of power control and medium access  control will lead to reduction of energy consumption.  We show a RF  power and medium access control trade-off.  Furthermore we discuss  applications of the results in IEEE 802.11 networks.  21 Refs.

Title: Evaluation of well-known protocol implementation techniques for  application in wireless networks
Abstract: Minimizing power consumption is a key requirement for mobile  terminals.  Here we discuss how power consumption of mobile terminals is influenced by the implementation of the protocol stack in the  mobile.  We compare the integrated layer processing (ILP) approach  with the server model and the activity thread model.  ILP is expected to lead to the fastest protocol implementation, and thus to the one  with the lowest power consumption.  To investigate this, we have  implemented the eXample Data Transfer (XDT) Protocol using all three approaches.  Our measurements show that the ILP approach can be  outperformed by both of the other techniques when the packet error  rate of the channel exceeds a threshold of 7%.  To cope with dynamic  changes we propose an adaptable implementation strategy, concluding  that the question of the response to errors on a wireless channel  requires careful consideration.  17 Refs.

Title: Performance evaluation of UDP Lite for cellular video
Abstract: The current generation of wireless links pose a significant challenge for sending video streams, as these links have low bit rate and high error rate compared to wired links.  Sending high bit rate  delay-sensitive traffic over wireless links requires appropriate  error resilient video compression algorithms and transport/link  layer protocols.  We have built a wireless video system using an  off-the-shelf error resilient low bit rate video codec with our  implementations of UDP Lite and PPP Lite, which are modifications to transport and link layer protocols respectively.  The flexible  check-summing schemes in these protocols allow error-resilient  application policies to be reflected in the networking stack.  We  conducted simulations and experimental evaluations of this wireless  video system using quantitative performance metrics (i.e.,  throughput, jitter, packet loss, and end-to-end latency).  30 Refs.

Title: Dimensioning server access bandwidth and multicast routing in overlay networks
Abstract: Application-level multicast is a new mechanism for enabling multicast in the Internet.  Driven by the fast growth of network audio/video  streams, application-level multicast has become increasingly  important for its efficiency of data delivery and its ability of  providing value-added services to satisfy application specific  requirements.  From a network design perspective, application-level  multicast differs drastically from traditional IP multicast in its  network cost model and routing strategies.  We present these  differences and formulate them as a network design problem  consisting of two parts: one is bandwidth assignment in the overlay  network, the other is load-balancing multicast routing with delay  constraints.  We use analytical methods and simulations to show that  our design solution is a valid and cost-effective approach.   Simulation results show that we are able to achieve network  utilization within 10% of the best possible utilization while  keeping the session rejection rate low.  17 Refs.

Title: Scalable techniques for discovering multicast tree topology
Abstract: The IP multicast infrastructure has transitioned to a topology that  now supports hierarchical routing.  Multicast network monitoring and  management have become key requirements necessary for providing  robust multicast operation.  Monitoring services help to identify  potential problems such as protocol shortcomings, implementation  bugs or configuration errors.  This type of monitoring often requires knowing the multicast tree topology.  In this paper, we present a new approach, called tracetree, to discover tree topology in the  source-to-receiver(s) direction using network forwarding state.  We  start with an overview of the problem.  Then, we describe tracetree  functionality including its request forwarding and response  collection mechanisms.  Next, we discuss a number of functional  issues related to tracetree.  Finally, we evaluate our technique by  comparing it to a number of alternative approaches.  We believe that  our technique provides a scalable way of discovering a multicast  tree's topology in realtime while requiring only marginal additional router functionality.  11 Refs.

Title: Un marco para IP global de difusion ilimitada (GIA) escalable   A framework for scalable global IP-anycast (GIA)
Abstract: This paper proposes GIA, a scalable architecture for global  IP-anycast.  Existing designs for providing IP-anycast must either  globally distribute mutes to individual anycast groups, or confine  each anycast group to a pre-configured topological region.  The first approach does not scale because of excessive growth in the routing  tables, whereas the second one severely limits the utility of the  service.  Our design scales by dividing inter-domain anycast routing  into two components.  The first component builds inexpensive default  anycast routes that consume no bandwidth or storage space.  The  second component, controlled by the edge domains, generates enhanced anycast routes that are customized according to the beneficiary  domain's interests.  We evaluate the performance of our design using  simulation, and prove its practicality by implementing it in the  Multi-threaded Routing Toolkit.  28 Refs.

Title: Evaluacion de dos esquemas de seguridad para agentes moviles   Evaluation of two security schemes for mobile agents
Abstract: In this article, we submit and compare two different but  complementary approaches to the problem of protecting mobile agents  in untrusted computing environments.  The first alternative, a  technique for protection of mobile agents built upon an asymmetric  cryptographic system resistant to conventional cryptoanalysis  techniques, is based on the application of one-time keys.  The second solution, geared towards computing environments supporting  public-key cryptographic systems, permits the simultaneous  protection of the code and data areas of mobile agents that travel  in an information network.  This latter protection mechanism can be  implemented using any asymmetric cryptosystem.  We believe the  protection strategies we have developed in our investigation are the first complete solution for the protection of mobile agents in  distributed computing environments.  14 Refs.

Title: A data tracking scheme for general networks
Abstract: Consider an arbitrary distributed network in which large numbers of  objects are continuously being created, replicated, and destroyed.  A basic problem arising in such an environment is that of organizing a data tracking scheme for locating object copies.  In this paper, we  present a new tracking scheme for locating nearby copies of  replicated objects in arbitrary distributed environments.  Our  tracking scheme supports efficient accesses to data objects while  keeping the local memory overhead low.  In particular, our tracking  scheme achieves an expected polylog(n)-approximation in the cost of  any access operation, for an arbitrary network.  The memory overhead  incurred by our scheme is O(polylog(n)) times the maximum number of  objects stored at any node, with high probability.  We also show that our tracking scheme adapts well to dynamic changes in the network.   25 Refs.

Title: Automatable verification of sequential consistency
Abstract: Sequential consistency is a multiprocessor memory model of both  practical and theoretical importance.  Designing and implementing a  memory system that efficiently provides a given memory model is a  challenging and error-prone task, so automated verification support  would be invaluable.  Unfortunately, the general problem of deciding  whether a finite-state protocol implements sequential consistency is undecidable.  In this paper, we identify a restricted class of  protocols for which verifying sequential consistency is decidable.   The class includes all published sequentially consistent protocols  that are known to us, and we argue why the class is likely to  include all real sequentially consistent protocols.  In principle,  our method can be applied in a completely automated fashion for  verification of all implemented protocols.  13 Refs.

Title: The TACO protocol processor simulation environment
Abstract: Network hardware design is becoming increasingly challenging because  more and more demands are put on network bandwidth and throughput  requirements, and on the speed with which new devices can be put on  the market.  Using current standard techniques (general purpose  microprocessors, ASIC's) these goals are difficult to reach  simultaneously.  One solution to this problem that has recently  attracted interest is the design of programmable processors with  network-optimized hardware, that is, network or protocol processors.  In this paper a simulation framework for a family of TTA protocol  processor architectures is proposed.  The protocol processors consist of a number of buses with functional units that encapsulate protocol specific operations.  The TACO protocol processor simulator is a C++  framework based on SystemC.  Functional units are created as C++  classes, which makes it easy to experiment with different  configurations of the processor to see its performance.  13 Refs.

Title: A practical tool box for system level communication synthesis
Abstract: This paper presents a practical approach to communication synthesis  for hardware/software system specified as tasks communicating  through lossless blocking channels.  It relies on a limited set of  templates that characterize the way data are exchanged between tasks realized either in software or in hardware.  The templates are highly portable because their software part is implemented using the POSIX  thread functions, and their hardware part is a hand crafted  synthesizable module with a System VCI interface.  These Interface  Modules allow simple Virtual Component reuse since they not only  implement protocol compatibility through the use of the System  VCI/OCB standard but also system level communications through  semantics widely accepted in the design community.  17 Refs.

Title: Towards universal software substrate for distributed embedded systems
Abstract: This paper proposes universal software substrate that is able to be  used to build various types of distributed embedded systems.  The  universal software substrate contains an operating system and  several middleware components.  It offers universal application  programming interface(Universal API) that increases application's  portability extremely.  Also, it makes the development speed of  distributed embedded applications dramatically fast since the high  level abstraction provided by universal software substrate decreases the amount of software that should be written from scratch.  The most important issue of our research is how to control the level of  abstraction when designing distributed embedded systems.  Our work is looking for methodologies to build portable software for distributed embedded systems in a systematic way.  We describe several software  components towards realizing universal software substrate, and some  research topics for achieving the goals.  45 Refs.

Title: Using semantic knowledge of distributed objects to increase  reliability and availability
Abstract: As systems become more distributed, they also become more complex.  To ensure consistent execution while maximizing availability,  distributed applications use various mechanisms such as replication, load balancing, and data caching.  The protocols used for consistency management and component availability are traditionally instantiated by the application.  However, in distributed object-based  environments like CORBA or Java RMI, the infrastructure can often  determine adequate protocols to guarantee liveness and safety based  on the request and semantic knowledge of the application.  This paper discusses how semantic knowledge of distributed objects can help  implement intelligent behavior in middleware and choose optimal  protocols for distributed component interactions.  17 Refs.

Title: Analysis of the IN call model suitability in the context of VoIP
Abstract: Packet networks are now considered as a potential network  infrastructure for providing telephony services.  Offering enhanced  services in today's networks largely relies on the use of  Intelligent Networks (IN).  Accessing IN services from packet  networks becomes an interesting challenge for transparently offering advanced services to end users, irrespective of the type of network  they use.  The compatibility of the IN call model with the call and  connection control procedures used in packet networks is the  prerequisite to achieve this goal.  This paper provides a detailed  compatibility analysis for the main architecture and protocols that  have been developed by standardization bodies to support telephony  over packet networks.

Title: Computational object approach for network and systems management
Abstract: In the past 20 years, Network and Systems Management (N&SM) has  thrived on mostly centralized or weakly distributed paradigms.   Advances in technologies and software engineering suggested new ways of doing N&SM.  The computational object approach is one of the main  management technologies that have recently appeared.  Based on this  approach, the architecture proposed in this paper uses programming  concepts instead of protocol concepts and conceals protocol  complexity by easily manipulated components.  Concerning the  information model, the Common Information Model (CIM) is used which  is designed in an object-oriented manner that is the key behind  scalable N&SM.  The implementation is done in the Windows environment and using the C++ programming language.  (Author abstract) 27 Refs.

Abstract: Convergence is one of the most frequently used catchwords in the  information and communication field.  While in general the increasing growing together of telecommunication, information and media  technology is understood by this term and much has already been  written about it, the term FMIC has existed for only a short time  yet in telecommunication, and has not yet appeared much in the  literature.  FMIC stands for fixed mobile internet convergence and  means the growing together of fixed networks, mobile networks and  the Internet.  In this article it will be demonstrated by means of  three top existing current services what one should expect from the  so-called FMIC-services.  (Author abstract) 7 Refs.

Title: Divisible e-cash system using secret sharing
Abstract: Divisibility of an e-cash is an important requirement for a practical e-cash system but has no practical solution up to now.  In this  paper, a divisible e-cash system for some special applications is  proposed using the secret sharing scheme.  A verifiable secret  sharing scheme based on the intractable discrete logarithm problem  is put forward as the building block in constructing the e-cash  system.  The e-cash system is smart-card oriented and the card is  denoted as the honest dealer to divide the coin in the payment  protocol.  The security of the divisible e-cash system can be derived directly from the security of the well-known Schnorr identification  and signature schemes and the security of intractable discrete  logarithm problem.

Title: Performance analysis of fast reservation protocols for burst-level  bandwidth allocation in ATM networks
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the performance of Fast Reservation  Protocols (FRP) for burst-level bandwidth allocation in ATM  networks.  FRP schemes can be classified into delayed transmission  (DT) and immediate transmission (IT) methods according to  reservation procedure.  Moreover, according to the responsibility for negative acknowledgment (NAK) cell generations when burst blocking  occurs, FRP schemes can be further classified into blocking node NAK (BNAK) and destination node NAK (DNAK) schemes.  We analize the FRP  schemes with different reservation and NAK methods for single node  and multihop network models, respectively.  We then discuss the  dependence of performance for each FRP scheme on propagation delay,  peak rate, and the number of hops.  (Author abstract) 13 Refs.

Title: MAC protocols supporting ITU-T recommendation G.983.1 for multimedia  services over ATM-based PON
Abstract: This paper proposes three MAC protocols over APON to provide  residential and small business customers with multimedia services.   The proposed protocols support the frame structure of ITU-T  recommendation G.983.1 and also provide diverse ATM service classes  such as CBR, rtVBR, nrtVBR, ABR, and UBR traffics.  Each service is  allocated on the basis of priority.  Especially, for allocating CBR  and rtVBR services, each protocol uses different cell arrival timing information which is achieved with specific coding and ranging  procedure.  Focusing the difference of cell arrival timing  information, we will investigate the performance of proposed  protocols.  For the proposed MAC protocols, we present grant field  format, minislot format, and bandwidth allocation algorithm.   Computer simulation shows the performance of the proposed protocols  in terms of CDV and delay, comparing with the normal FIFO protocol.   (Author abstract) 11 Refs.

Title: On the use of Control Variates in the simulation of medium access  control protocols
Abstract: Simulation is an essential tool for performance evaluation of  communication networks.  We are interested in the waiting time W of  packets.  The Control Variates method takes profit of the knowledge  about another stochastic process strongly correlated with W to  reduce the uncertainty in the estimation of its mean.  We analyze the usefulness of the cycle time as a control stochastic process for  Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols with polling service  discipline, showing its potential and drawbacks.  We propose a  control variate that overcomes the disadvantages of cycle time and  show its behavior in a case study.  This new control variate will  also be useful in the case of other MAC protocols.  (Author abstract) 9 Refs.

Title: Soft-Commissioning: Hardware-in-the-loop-based verification of  controller software
Abstract: The basic idea of Soft-Commissioning (SoftCom) is to test industrial  control software by connecting a controller, e. g. a PLC  (Programmable Logic Controller) to a commercial discrete event  simulator (DES), which provides system reactions and sensor signals  similar to the behavior of real hardware, e. g. an industrial  manufacturing line.  In order to establish a connection between  simulator and PLC, a modular architecture was developed.  The basis  of this modular system is a communication protocol common to all  members.  The two basic modules are the I/O Devices Driver (IODD),  which is used to interface between the I/O hardware and the SoftCom  protocol, and the Simulator to real World Interface (SWI).  The SWI  is used to link the simulator to the SoftCom system.  (Author  abstract) 33 Refs.

Title: Declarative ad-hoc sensor networking
Abstract: Networking protocols for distributed collaborative ad-hoc wireless  sensing are constrained by requirements such as energy efficiency,  scalability, and support for greater variations in topology than  traditional fully wired or last-hop wireless (remote to base  station) networks.  In such a highly constrained and dynamic  environment, conventional networking approaches are generally not  adequate.  A declarative approach to network configuration and  organization appears to offer significant benefits.  Declarative  networking exploits application-supplied data descriptions to  control network routing and resource allocation in such a way as to  enhance energy efficiency and scalability.  An implementation of this approach, called the Declarative Routing Protocol (DRP) has been  developed as part of DARPA's Sensor Information Technology program.   This paper introduces the concept of declarative networking and what distinguishes it from more conventional networking approaches,  describes the Declarative Routing Protocol, and presents performance results from initial experiments.

Title: Numerical modelling of the mechanical process of particle detachment  by finite element method
Abstract: This paper presents a numerical simulation technique for calculating  the strain and the stress state at every point of the Surfaces,  containing real surface topology and layered structure.  Depending on the nature of deformation, we can evaluate the actual stress and  strain state either from the point of view of the fatigue failure or from the point of view of the exhaustion of deformation capacity of  the surfaces.  Using the stress and strain components calculated by  the Finite Element Method at every nodal point of the surfaces, it  is possible to predict the probable surfaces degradation mechanism,  i.e. to predict the probable mechanism of the particle detachment  under dry sliding conditions, under consideration of the nominal  load and to the required lifetime of the surface.  23 Refs.

Title: Failure analysis of laminated composite pretwisted rotating plates
Abstract: In this paper a finite element computational procedure is presented  for the determination of first-ply failure strengths of pretwisted  rotating plates subjected to centre point transverse load.  The  finite element model is based on the tensor polynomial failure  criterion that contains the maximum stress, maximum strain,  Tsai-Hill, Tsai-Wu and Hoffman failure criteria as special cases.  A  nine-noded three-dimensional degenerated composite shell element is  developed and used for the present finite element formulation.   Effects of transverse shear deformation and rotary inertia are  included.  Lagrange's equation of motion is employed to derive the  dynamic equilibrium equation considering moderate rotational speeds  for which the Coriolis effect is negligible.  Finally, the static  equilibrium equation is formulated after discarding the  time-dependent terms.  Failure load computations for rotating  cantilever plates with nonlinear pretwist are carried out to  investigate the effects of angle of twist, rotational speed and  laminate configuration.  22 Refs.

Title: Progressive failure analysis of plain weaves using damage mechanics  based constitutive laws
Abstract: The behaviour of plain woven fabric composites is studied using  three-dimensional finite elements which allows detailed modelling of the geometric complexities and spatial material variations within  the fabric.  Damage in the composite constituents, viz., yarn and  pure matrix is modeled on a continuum basis, and related to their  material constitutive behaviour.  The 3D constitutive laws describing pure matrix and yarn behaviour are developed using a damage  mechanics based approach with the dissipated energy density as the  damage parameter.  The strain energy dissipation (SED) concept is  employed to describe the damage state and current stiffnesses of the weave constituents.  A progressive failure analysis of plain woven  fabrics subjected to tension and in-plane shear is carried out  considering both geometric and material nonlinearities.  The  initiation and progression of damage within the fabric is  investigated and the significant damage mechanisms outlined.  18  Refs.

Title: Micromechanical analysis of fatigue cracks in cord-rubber composites
Abstract: Analyses of two different types of cracks due to fatigue of  cord-rubber composites is carried out using micromechanical  two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) finite element  analysis.  The fracture parameter, tearing energy (TE)/J-integral  that characterizes the severity of crack tip stresses in rubber  composites, is computed from the finite element results of stresses  and strains.  The results obtained are validated with existing  analytical methods in the literature.  Numerical results of  J-integral values are presented for two crack types, and crack sizes under transverse strain and shear strain loading conditions.  The  results presented illustrate that crack type, loading, and crack  size have a strong effect on the values of J-integral.  The results  of the J-integral should help our understanding in estimating the  severity of local failures in cord-rubber composites. copy 2001  Elsevier Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  18 Refs.

Title: A reliability centered optimal visual inspection model for  distribution feeders
Abstract: For an electric power distribution system, highly reliable operation  is important for maintaining customer satisfaction.  To maintain high levels of system reliability, inspection is used to identify  potential problems, allowing necessary maintenance actions to be  taken before failure occurs.  The question is then how much  inspection is required to maintain high reliability levels.  This  paper describes a Markov model of the inspection process.  The model  finds the optimal inspection frequency by considering the tradeoff  between the cost of inspection and the cost of poor reliability.  An  objective function is formulated that minimizes the total cost of  inspection, repair, and reliability.  This model has been  specifically created for determining the optimal visual inspection  frequency for distribution feeder rights-of-way.  The results from  applying this model to a practical distribution system are  presented, and extensions of this model to other systems are  discussed.  21 Refs.

Title: Fault diagnosis based on the fuzzy-recurrent neural network
Abstract: A fuzzy-recurrent neural network (FRNN) has been constructed by  adding some feedback connections to a feedforward fuzzy neural  network (FNN).  The FRNN expands the modeling ability of FNN in order to deal with temporal problems.  A basic concept of the FRNN is first to use process or expert knowledge, including appropriate fuzzy  logic rules and membership functions, to construct an initial  structure and to then use parameter-learning algorithms to fine-tune the membership functions and other parameters.  Its recurrent  property makes it suitable for dealing with temporal problems, such  as on-line fault diagnosis.  In addition, it also provides  human-understandable meaning to the normal feedforward multilayer  neural network, in which the internal units are always opaque to  users.  The trained FRNN has good interpreting ability and  one-step-ahead predicting ability.  To demonstrate the performance of the FRNN in diagnosis, a comparison is made with a conventional  feedforward network.  The efficiency of the FRNN is verified by the  results.  9 Refs.

Title: Genetic algorithms for reliability assessment of mining equipment
Abstract: Discusses an ongoing research work which attempts to formulate,  develop and test mining equipment reliability assessment models  based on genetic algorithms.  Genetic algorithms are powerful and  broadly applicable stochastic search techniques based on the  principles of natural selection, heredity and genetics.  The reason  for selecting genetic algorithms is the fact that the reliability of mining equipment changes over time due to its dependence upon  several covariates/factors (e.g. equipment age, the operating  environment, number and quality of repairs).  These factors combine  to create a complex impact on an equipment's reliability function.   Gives an example of the application of genetic algorithms to capture the impact of these factors on time between failures of a piece of  mining equipment.  32 Refs.

Title: Failure probability assessment of parallel redundant structures
Abstract: Considered in the analysis are complex systems with parallel  redundancy.  The failure probability of such a system is assessed by  the strength probabilistic properties of the structural elements.   There is a finite number of parallel structural elements that  provides the maximum possible reliability of the system.  Parallel  systems may fail by instantaneous growth of failed elements.  The  tendency to catastrophic failure depends on the element strength  probability and overload.  Calculated is the critical stress  corresponding to the beginning of catastrophic failure of the  parallel system.  Weibull probability distribution is used for  describing the structural element strength.  The critical stress  ranges from 50% to 95% of the mean single element strength; depends  on the overload and probability distribution. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science Ltd.

Title: Fault-tolerant control of linear systems with uncertainties
Abstract: A new design method for robust fault-tolerant controller of an  uncertain linear system was put forward by using H// infinity robust control results.  When some sensor and actuator are fault within a  pre-specified subset of sensors and actuators, have the plant  disturbance and measurement noise, and the uncertainties of the  system are of norm bounded, a robust fault tolerant controller is  designed by constructing an auxiliary system without uncertainties  in the term of positive define solution of Hamilton-Jacobi  inequalities(HJIs).  The controller is not only integrity against  sensor and actuator fault, but also robustness in the presence of  plant disturbance and measurement noise, and guarantees the robust  asymptotic stability and H// infinity performance of the close loop  system.  The controller presents a new way to solve fault tolerant  robust control problem of the linear system with uncertainties.  10  Refs.

Title: A heuristic algorithm for the buffer allocation in unreliable  unbalanced production lines
Abstract: In this work we investigate the buffer allocation problem (BAP) in  short unbalanced production lines consisting of up to six machines  that are subject to breakdowns.  Times to failure are assumed  exponential whereas service and repair times are allowed to follow  any Erlang-k distribution (with k greater than or equivalent 1).  An  algorithm that is based on the sectioning (segmentation) approach  was developed which solves the BAP.  This, in conjunction with a  method not previously reported that determines a "good" initial  solution for the buffer allocation constitutes the main contribution of the present work.  The accuracy of the proposed heuristic  algorithm is remarkably good and its convergence is fast making it a promising tool that can be implemented in conjunction with a fast  decomposition method to solve the BAP in large production lines.   copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: Criticality in a model of banking crises
Abstract: An interbank market lets participants pool the risk arising from the  combination of illiquid investments and random withdrawals by  depositors.  But it also creates the potential for one bank's failure to trigger off avalanches of further failures.  We simulate a model  of interbank lending to study the interplay of these two effects.  We show that when banks are similar in size and exposure to risk,  avalanche effects are small so that widening the interbank market  leads to more stability.  But as heterogeneity increases, avalanche  effects become more important.  By varying the heterogeneity and  connectivity across banks, the system enters a critical regime with  a power law distribution of avalanche sizes. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science B.V.

Title: Scanning ultrasonic spectroscopy for composite flywheels
Abstract: Composite flywheels are being considered as a replacement for  chemical batteries aboard the International Space Station (ISS).  Due to the serious consequences of a failure in a space environment,  extensive testing of the flywheel systems must be conducted prior to flight certification.  In addition to standard material testing and  characterization, non destructive evaluation (NDE) of the rotors  must be preformed to identify processing flaws and to understand the damage progression in a rotor under load.  This paper describes the  development of a scanning ultrasonic spectroscopy system for the NDE of composite flywheels.  Emphasis is placed on the novel resonance  spectroscopy method that was investigated and its integration into a scanning system.  Results of a scan of a composite ring standard and  Plexiglas cylinder with known defects are presented and compared to  ultrasonic pulse-echo c-scans.  8 Refs.

Title: Stick-slip type crack growth during instrumented high-speed impact of HDPE and HDPE/Selar registered trademark discontinuous laminar  microlayer composites
Abstract: Stick-slip type crack growth was triggered in high-density  polyethylene (HDPE) and HDPE/Selar registered trademark  discontinuous laminar microlayer composites by instrumented Charpy  impact under suitable test conditions (temperature -40 degree C,  hammer speed 3.7 m/s).  Fractographic analysis showed that crazing is responsible for this peculiar fracture.  The onset of this stick-slip phenomenon was favored by a mixed plane strain/plane stress  condition prevailing in the specimens.  The relative orientation of  the Selar microlayers in respect to the crack growth direction  affected the stick-slip type crack growth and the related failure  considerably.  No stick-slip type crack propagation was observed when gasoline-plasticized specimens were impacted, which failed by  ductile tearing instead of crazing.  12 Refs.

Title: Micromechanically based continuum damage mechanics material laws for  fiber-reinforced ceramics
Abstract: A micromechanically based continuum damage mechanics material law is  developed for fiber-reinforced ceramics.  Its parameters and internal variables are obtained from micromechanical models rather than from  macroscopic experiments.  Micromechanical models are derived for the  damage and failure mechanisms observed in 2D C/C-SiC composite  samples loaded by tension, shear and compression.  In specimens  subjected to tension, the early stage of damage is characterized by  transverse cracking.  Further load increase induces fiber failure in  the longitudinal plies, what leads to fracture.  Shear loading  initiates cracks oriented at 0 degree /90 degree and 45 degree to  the fiber axes, the latter causing fracture.  Specimens loaded in  compression exhibit catastrophic failure due to microbuckling of  fiber bundles.  Simulation results show the ability of the developed  model to describe the observed failure mechanism in experiments.   copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  9 Refs.

Title: Open-contact-failure detection of via holes by using voltage contrast
Abstract: We used two techniques to determine the sensitivity of a  scanning-electron-microscope-based wafer-inspection system in  detecting open-contact failures.  (1) The correlation between the  contact resistance and the brightness of the voltage-contrast image  as captured by the system was obtained experimentally.  (2) A  voltage-contrast simulation was developed and applied to derive a  correlation between resistance and brightness from these results.  A  close agreement between the experimental results and the calculated  values was obtained.  We succeeded in clarifying the determinants of  the sensitivity of open-contact-failure detection.  The brightness,  over part of its range, appears to be proportional to log(R center  dot I//P), where R is the resistance and I//P, is the irradiating  electron-beam current.  This relationship indicates that the  sensitivity of open-contact failure detection is determined by I//P.  Control of I//P can be used to improve the voltage contrast, and  this, in turn, can improve the sensitivity of detection.  13 Refs.

Title: Power spectral density (PSD) technique in damage detection
Abstract: A damage detection method was implemented for a simply supported beam structure.  The analytical model was compared to experimental  results.  The theoretical model was obtained from an energy  formulation of the problem using the Rayleigh-Ritz method to obtain  the equation of motion.  Matrices were composed in a State Space  model to reproduce the input-output system between actuator and  sensor.  The damage was modeled with material property variations in  a small section of the beam.  The experimental set up consisted of an aluminum beam with damage introduced by adding different weights in  various locations.  Two piezoelectric patches were used to provide  the dynamical excitation and output the response.  The dynamic  changes were investigated and compared with theoretical predictions  with good agreement obtained.  The Power Spectral Density (PSD)  approach was used to obtain information related to the size of  damage.  The analysis resulted independent of damage location.  23  Refs.

Title: Remeshing techniques for r-adaptive and combined h/r-adaptive  analysis with application to 2D/3D crack propagation
Abstract: Remeshing strategies are formulated for r-adaptive and h/r-adaptive  analysis of crack propagation.  The relocation of the nodes, which  typifies r-adaptivity, is a very cheap method to optimise a given  discretisation since the element connectivity remains unaltered.   However, the applicability is limited.  To further improve the finite element mesh, a combined h/r-adaptive method is proposed in which  h-adaptivity is applied whenever r-adaptivity is not capable of  further improving the discretisation.  Two and three-dimensional  examples are presented.  It is shown that the r-adaptive approach can optimise a discretisation at minimal computational costs.  Further,  the combined h/r-adaptive approach improves the performance of a  fully r-adaptive technique while the number of h-remeshings is  reduced compared to a fully h-adaptive technique.  25 Refs.

Title: Common-mode failures in redundant VLSI systems: A survey
Abstract: This paper presents a survey of CMF (common-mode failures) in  redundant systems with emphasis on VLSI (very large scale  integration) systems.  The paper discusses CMF in redundant systems,  their possible causes, and techniques to analyze reliability of  redundant systems in the presence of CMF.  Current practice and  recent results on the use of design diversity techniques for CMF are reviewed.  By revisiting the CMF problem in the context of VLSI  systems, this paper augments earlier surveys on CMF in nuclear and  power-supply systems.  The need for quantifiable metrics and  effective models for CMF in VLSI systems is re-emphasized.  These  metrics and models are extremely useful in designing reliable  systems.  For example, using these metrics and models, system  designers and synthesis tools can incorporate diversity in redundant systems to maximize protection against CMF.  57 Refs.

Title: Production and maintenance control for manufacturing systems
Abstract: This note addresses the production and maintenance control problem of a failure prone manufacturing system consisting of one machine and  producing one part type.  The machine is assumed to have three  working states: good, average and bad, and a failure state.  In the  three working states, the machine can produce parts and some of  these parts are rejected with a rate depending on the machine state.  In the failure state, no part is produced.  The state transition of  the machine is governed by a continuous-time Markov process.  The  jump rates from average and bad states to the good state are the  preventive maintenance rates and the one from failure state to good  state is the corrective maintenance rate.  The production rate and  the maintenance rates are optimized.  10 Refs.

Title: Effect of silicon nitride capping layer on via electromigration and  failure criterion methodology in multilevel interconnection
Abstract: Electromigration of via-terminated Al(Cu) stripes in two-level and  four-level interconnect structures was studied.  We found that the  top-level metals adjacent to the dielectric capping layers exhibited the longest electromigration lifetimes and sustained the highest  critical current densities.  Comparison of capping layers with and  without SiN suggests that the electromigration lifetime enhancement  is due to the mechanical constraint of the SiN capping layer, which  has a larger Young's modulus than that of the oxide.  We discuss  various cases of current shunting in terms of pure edge, mixed and  pure random depletions.  We deduce the failure criteria of upper and  lower metal levels based on current shunting effect, and compare  them with microanalysis results. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Fault prognostics using dynamic wavelet neural networks
Abstract: Modern industry is concerned about extending the lifetime of its  critical processes and maintaining them only when required.   Significant aspects of these trends include the ability to diagnose  impending failures, prognosticate the remaining useful lifetime of  the process and schedule maintenance operations so that uptime is  maximized.  Prognosis is probably the most difficult of the three  issues leading to condition-based maintenance (CBM).  This paper  attempts to address this challenging problem with  intelligence-oriented techniques, specifically dynamic wavelet  neural networks (DWNNs).  DWNNs incorporate temporal information and  storage capacity into their functionality so that they can predict  into the future, carrying out fault prognostic tasks.  Such  fundamental issues as the network structure, learning algorithms,  stability analysis, uncertainty management, and performance  assessment are studied in a theoretical framework.  An example is  presented in which a trained DWNN successfully prognoses a defective bearing with a crack in its inner race.  23 Refs.

Title: The SACSO methodology for troubleshooting complex systems
Abstract: The paper describes the task of performing efficient  decision-theoretic troubleshooting of electromechanical devices.  In  general, this task is NP-complete, but under fairly strict  assumptions, a greedy approach will yield an optimal sequence of  actions, as discussed in the paper.  This set of assumptions is  weaker than the set proposed by Heckerman et al.  (1995).  However,  the printing system domain, which motivated the research and which  is described in detail in the paper, does not meet the requirements  for the greedy approach, and a heuristic method is used.  The method  takes value of identification of the fault into account and it also  performs a partial two-step look-ahead analysis.  We compare the  results of the heuristic method with optimal sequences of actions,  and find only minor differences between the two.  9 Refs.

Title: Estimation and application of correlation dimension of experimental  time series
Abstract: This paper reports the Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm and its  modified version, with particular regard to how to reduce  computation time, to avoid dynamic correlation, and to determine the scaling region.  The influencing factors of correlation dimension  computation of experimental data, especially the data length and  noise level, are described comprehensively.  Results show that not  theoretical consideration but the D//2(m) - ln(r/r//0) function  should be used to determine the minimal requirement of data length  of experimental data.  In some cases, nonlinear noise reduction is  necessary.  Nonlinear time series analysis theory based on  correlation dimension for practical application, especially for  gearbox fault diagnosis, is introduced.  Results show that the  correlation dimension can usefully the different kinematics  mechanisms.  32 Refs.

Title: Unfall durch drahtseilriss in einer tunnelbaustelle   Accident in a tunnel by breaking of a wire rope
Abstract: At a building site in the alps a gas-pipeline was being installed in  a tunnel.  When a section of the pipeline which had just been welded  was lowered using a winch the wire rope snapped and the load dropped through the tunnel for more than 600 meters by which several workers were killed.  Because the strength of the wire rope should  theoretically have been sufficient a detailed failure analysis was  carried out.  The results of the analysis were that the rope had  broken by overload at a guide sheave.  The fracture had been promoted by a high static load of the rope, additional dynamic forces, high  local stresses of the wires at the sheave, a disturbed composition  of the strands in the rope and peculiarities of the used winch.  4  Refs.

Abstract: This paper presents the preliminary results of a study of a  composite-tube-reinforced concrete column.  In such a column, the  plain concrete was cast inside the prefabricated composite tube with no steel reinforcement.  Two circular conventional reinforced  concrete columns, as reference specimens, and three glass-fiber  composite tube columns have been tested under quasi-static loading.   The three- dimensional strain and horizontal displacement were  measured with rosette strain gauges and LVDTs, respectively, while  the microcrack and failure processes were monitored by means of  acoustic emission (AE).  The objective of this test is to assess the  mechanical behaviour (strength, ductility) of concrete columns  reinforced with the glass-fiber composite tube.  The  composite-tube-reinforced concrete column shows greatly enhanced  seismic resistance as compared to the conventional reinforced  column.  Hence, there is great future potential for the use of such  structures in seismic regions. copy 2001 Published by Elsevier  Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  10 Refs.

Title: The effect of matrix stiffness on the creep-rupture lifetime of  carbon fiber/epoxy composites
Abstract: Seven-fiber, hexagonally-packed microcomposites were made using  PAN-based carbon fibers embedded in two epoxy systems, one stiffer  than the other.  The stiffer system was a bisphenol-A-based epoxy  having an initial modulus of 1620 MPa and a strain to failure of  0.09, while the more flexible system, with an initial modulus 538  MPa and a strain to failure 0.32, was a 50/50 (w/w) mixture of the  stiffer epoxy and a polyglycol diepoxide.  A tetraethylene pentamine  hardener was used with both.  Creep-rupture tests (N greater than or  equivalent 24) were carried out at 80% and 75% of the value of the  Weibull scale parameter (63rd percentile) for microcomposite  strength.  At these stress levels, the scale parameter for lifetimes  was significantly (P less than 0.05) greater for the stiff epoxy: 74 s vs.  6 s at 80% and 294 s vs.  26 s at 75%.  Monte Carlo simulations  show that the logarithms of creep-rupture lifetime are inversely  proportional to the propensity to creep. copy 2001 Elsevier Science  Ltd.  All rights reserved.  9 Refs.

Title: Seismic evaluation and retrofit of damaged R/C buildings
Abstract: A severe earthquake measuring Ms 6.2 occurred near the city of Ceyhan (population 100 000) in Southern Turkey on 27 June 1998.  Although  the focal distance to Ceyhan was 32 km, fault rupture was directed  towards Ceyhan, causing heavy damage in the city as a result of a  strong motion with a PGA of 0.28 g. Out of a total number of 146  casualties, 86 were in Ceyhan.  Twelve R/C buildings collapsed and  120 were classified as moderately damaged in Ceyhan.  These 120  multistory buildings have been inspected and their seismic retrofit  projects have been prepared by the Earthquake Engineering Research  Center of the Middle East Technical University (METU/EERC).  The  retrofit works include detailed damage assessment and structural  evaluation of the existing buildings, selection of the retrofit  scheme, and final performance verification by the capacity spectrum  method.  Cast in place concrete infill walls are employed as the  primary elements of seismic retrofit.  The selected retrofit scheme  has provided the required seismic safety and economy.  10 Refs.

Title: Actuarial modelling of overhead line components: A case study in wood pole inspection and replacement
Abstract: This paper describes a procedure which can be used to analyse life  data of overhead line poles and components where some form of  censored (limited) failure observations are available.  The aim is to be able to obtain an actuarial expectation of the life of a  population upon which an assessment of inspection and maintenance  needs can be made, trading off the risk of liability from an  accidental failure against the known cost of repair and or  replacement before failure.  The case study has its motivation in  wood as a dominant structural material in Australian overhead line  systems and that wood, unlike other materials used, has  non-homogeneous structural characteristics, which makes it  particularly difficult to model statistically.  7 Refs.

Title: Tests for overhead insulated mains
Abstract: This paper summarises work on the degradation of aerial bundled  cables (ABC) and covered conductors (CC) with emphasis on long-term  performance of polymeric insulation.  Although ABC and CC have been  used by utilities worldwide for more than fifty years, current  Australian and international standards do not include tests that  would provide reliable assessment of long-term performance of the  mains insulation.  The goals of the work were to identify operating  problems and failure mechanisms of ABC and CC, search for suitable  tests in international standards and to propose tests for inclusion  into current Australian standards.  Specific areas of interest were  weathering and ultraviolet radiation protection of polymers,  thermomechanical breakdown of polymer insulation and current  overload protection, flame propagation, surface tracking, abrasion  resistance and mechanical creep.  38 Refs.

Title: Language identification of controlled systems: Modeling, control and  anomaly detection
Abstract: Formal language techniques have been used in the past to study  autonomous dynamical systems.  However, for controlled systems, new  features are needed to distinguish between information generated by  the system and input control.  We show how the modeling framework for controlled dynamical systems leads naturally to a formulation in  terms of context-dependent grammars.  A learning algorithm is  proposed for on-line generation of the grammar productions, this  formulation being then used for modeling, control, and anomaly  detection.  Practical applications are described for  electromechanical drives.  Grammatical interpolation techniques yield accurate results, and the pattern detection capabilities of the  language-based formulation makes it a promising technique for the  early detection of anomalies or faulty behavior.  25 Refs.

Title: A modeling and analysis methodology for modular logic controllers of  machining systems using Petri net formalism
Abstract: Logic controllers for machining systems typically have three control  modes: auto, hand, and manual.  In this paper, a unified formal  representation of logic controllers with three control modes is  provided using Petri nets (PNs).  A modular logic controller  structure is introduced and formalized for high-volume transfer  lines.  The modular logic controller consists of a control module for mode decision and control modules for station logic controllers.   Each station control module is represented by connecting operation  modules which are designed with respect to the fault recovery  processes of operations; their connection algorithm is also  provided.  In our formal representation, each control module is  represented by a live, safe, and reversible PN.  A condition for the  modular logic controller to generate a correct control logic is  provided: operation causality condition.  Using the modular structure of a logic controller, the control logic can be easily reconfigured  and automatic code generation is possible.  45 Refs.

Title: Model-aided diagnosis: An inexpensive combination of model-based and  case-based condition assessment
Abstract: Online condition monitoring and diagnosis are utilized more and more  for increasing the reliability and availability of technical systems and to reduce maintenance costs.  Today's model-based diagnosis (MBD) tools are able to detect and identify incipient and sudden faults  very reliably.  For application on cost-sensitive equipment such as  high-voltage circuit breakers (HVCBs), however, the presently  available MBD systems are not feasible for economic reasons.  In this paper, a novel combination of the model-based with the case-based  approach to condition diagnosis is presented, which can be  implemented on a low-cost computer and offers satisfactory  performance.  The technique is divided into two parts: 1) preparation and 2) diagnosis.  The diagnosis part can be executed on an  inexpensive low-performance computer.  Successful tests on real HVCBs confirm the usefulness of this new approach to condition diagnosis.   16 Refs.

Title: System-level test synthesis for mixed-signal designs
Abstract: Hierarchical test approaches are a must for large designs due to the  computational complexity and tight time-to-market requirements.  In  hierarchical test synthesis, test design is conducted at a subsystem level where the design complexity is manageable.  For analog systems, tests are generally designed at the basic block level.  This paper  outlines a tool for translating basic block-level tests into  system-level tests for large analog systems.  Computational  effectiveness is achieved by the use of high level models and by a  pre-analysis of the system to identify feasible translation paths.  A method to compute the fault and yield coverages of the resultant  system-level tests is also provided in order to evaluate the  translation.  Experimental results show that test translation reduces design for testability overhead significantly while satisfying  coverage requirements.  17 Refs.

Title: The fold catastrophe model of constitutive failure in compression  post
Abstract: The problem of constitutive failure of materials and members belongs  to the fold catastrophe in the catastrophe theory.  The fold  catastrophe model, which is deduced from the curve expression of the constitive relationship of the axially compressed plain, concrete  member, can give the brittle failure criterion of the members, and  analyze the postckling behavior of ductility and brittle failure  paths of the members.  In establishing this model, the stiffness of  test machine was taken as finite value according to the reality,  thus the loading parameter-the energy input rate was obtained.   Therefore the system stability in the weakened section of the  load-displacement curve of concrete members can be correctly  described.  Lastly, the load effect to loading device caused by the  brittle failure of concrete members was calculated.  10 Refs.

Title: Role of failure modes on energy absorption in unidirectional PMC  tubes
Abstract: The primary focus of this investigation was to study the effect of  failure modes on key energy absorption parameters including the  initial peak load (P//p//e//a//k), the drop in the peak load and the sustained crushing load (P//a//v//g//.) in the crushing process of  unidirectional polymer matrix composite (PMC) tubes under  quasi-static conditions.  The failure modes of interest are the axial cracks, the transverse cracks and delamination.  The roles of  initiators with different radii and external constraints were  carefully analyzed in the context of primary failure modes using a  real time image acquisition system.  The results for  fiberglass/polyester tubes showed that the failure modes play a  critical role on the load-deflection (P-delta) response of the tubes and their corresponding specific energy absorption (SEA).  In  addition, it was possible to control the failure modes for better  crushing performance by using external constraints combined with  initiators.  14 Refs.

Title: Estimation for failure probability of brittle fracture structure
Abstract: The probabilistic finite element method was used to study the failure probability for a structural brittle fracture.  A singular element  was introduced to describe the singular strain field near crack tip.  The computational procedure for derivatives of the stress intensity  factors with respect to various random variables were simplified  through the adjoint approach.  The statistical moments of stress  intensity factors for various random variables were calculated.  The  reliability index was calculated using optimization procedure, then  the probability of fracture was determined by using a first-order  reliability theory.  The result of an illustrated example, a plane  strain mode I fracture problem, show that the method is a practical  method for estimating the safety and fracture probability of a  flawed structure.

Title: Fault diagnosis method under the condition of redundant constraint  based on Monte Carlo simulation
Abstract: The parts can not be located accurately because of the worn, loose or broken location elements in the process of assembly of body, and  this is the main cause for assembly tolerance of body.  Fault  diagnosis method only follows the 3-2-1 fixturing principle now.   There is not a clear geometric relationship between the location  element displacement and measurement point variation under the  condition of redundant constraint.  In this paper, Monte Carlo method was used to simulate positions of a part, and a model was presented  to diagnose the fault based on statistical data, which gives the  probability of detecting faults and the probability of false alarms  also.  The results of the Monte Carlo simulation show that this  method is reasonable.  (Edited abstract) 3 Refs.

Title: Understanding and control of adhesive crack propagation in bonded  joints between carbon fibre composite adherends II. Finite element  analysis
Abstract: Carbon fibre composites are being widely considered for many classes  of heavily loaded components.  A common feature of such components is the need to introduce local or global loads into the composite  structure.  The use of adhesive bonding rather than mechanical  fasteners offers the potential for reduced weight and cost.  However, such bonded joints must be shown to behave in a predictable and  reliable way.  A major aspect of this is to demonstrate that the  progress of cracks through the bonds is well understood.  The  simulation work presented here complements the experimental work  presented in Part I. The observed failure processes and their  sequence are successfully described and modelled. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  8 Refs.

Title: Stress state and failure mechanisms of thermal barrier coatings: Role of creep in thermally grown oxide
Abstract: The mechanical loading of the thermal barrier coating (TBC)/thermally grown oxide (TGO)/bond coat interface region is calculated for a TBC coated superalloy specimen using a finite element model.  It is shown that the evolving stress state depends crucially on the ratio of the loading rate caused by growth and swelling of the oxide layer and  the unloading rate by creep relaxation.  For grain sizes below 1 mum, creep of the oxide layer cannot be neglected.  From this  calculations, possible damage scenarios are inferred and  implications for future design of TBC layers are considered.   Tailoring the TGO creep properties, for example by reducing its  grain size or designing a multilayer TGO scale, is identified as the most relevant aspect. copy 2001 Acta Materialia Inc.

Title: Integrated metrology: An enabler for advanced process control (APC)
Abstract: Advanced process control (APC) techniques become more and more  important as short innovation cycles in microelectronics and a  highly competitive market requires cost-effective solutions in  semiconductor manufacturing.  APC marks a paradigm shift from  statistically based techniques (SPC) using monitor wafers for  sampling measurement data towards product wafer control.  The APC  functionalities including run-to-run control, fault detection, and  fault analysis allow to detect process drifts and excursions at an  early stage and to minimize the number of misprocessed wafers.  APC  is being established as part of factory control systems through the  definition of an APC framework.  A precondition for APC is the  availability of sensors and measurement methods providing the  necessary wafer data.  This paper discusses integrated metrology as  an enabler for APC and demonstrates practical implementations in  semiconductor manufacturing.  19 Refs.

Abstract: In recent years, scanning acoustic microscopy(SAM) has been found to  be a very successful technique when used in the microelectronics  industry to evaluate, from a reliability perspective, standard  plastic packaging technologies such as PQFP's, PLCC's, DIP's and  SOP's. [1,2] The recent explosion of  advanced packaging techniques such as Chip-on-Board, Flip-chip and  BGA and the proliferation of Microsystems has further widened the  arena of what constitutes microelectronics.  With such a wide breadth of devices from standard plastic packages to state-of-the-art  microsystems, it is difficult to find a failure analysis technique  which can cope competently with that scope.

Title: Assessment on fracture failure probability of buried pipelines
Abstract: By means of Monte-Carlo simulation, a computer program named as BPFA  (Buried Pipeline Failure Analysis) is developed and applied to  compute failure probability related to various kinds of random  factors.  As examples, the actual analyses about an oil pipeline are  given.  The results demonstrate that the difference of assessment  using R6 general curve, CMn curve in R6 appendix 8, CVDA-84  specification for pressure vessel and K//I factor theory is small in the early stage of service, and it becomes larger in the late stage.  Among all the parameters, initial defect depth, fracture toughness,  flow stress, and pipe thickness have significant effects on the  failure probability.  The assigned styles of distribution of  parameters have also effects on the failure probability.  Proof test  with water pressure could greatly reduce the failure probability of  pipelines in service.  9 Refs.

Title: A generic conceptual simulation model for maintenance systems
Abstract: Maintenance is a complex process that is triggered by equipment  failure or planned repair.  This process requires planning,  scheduling, control and the deployment of maintenance resources to  perform necessary maintenance activities.  In this paper a generic  conceptual model for maintenance systems has been developed.  The  conceptual model consists of seven modules.  The first one is the  input module in which the characteristic of the maintenance system  is specified.  The second module is concerned with modeling the  maintenance load.  The third module is the planning and scheduling.   This module is the most critical, since it controls the maintenance  process.  The fourth module is the material and spare parts supply,  followed by the equipment availability module.  The sixth module is  the quality control module and the performance measures are the  seventh module.  The specification of such a conceptual model lays  the ground for developing a realistic simulation model.  18 Refs.

Abstract: Rolling element bearing failures in paper mill machines are  considered in relation to their critical role in the machine  function.  The use of expensive, sophisticated and highly automated  equipment and machines and the intention to achieve higher quality  products, longer machine life, higher machinery effectiveness and  safer operating processes were the main driving force motivating  efforts to improve the maintenance concept during the last 50 years.  In this paper, a conceptual model that integrates the available  condition information, the deterministic models used in condition  monitoring based upon mechanical theory and the probabilistic models used in the area of operational research is developed and its  applicability is discussed.  This model covers fault detection of a  mechanical component such as a rolling element bearing, prediction  of its vibration level in the near future assessment of the  probability of failure of a component over a finite period of time  of interest.  21 Refs.

The constitutive  laws are derived based on a continuum approach and the governing  equations are developed where the thermal strain is taken into  account together with elastic and plastic strains.  The Elliptical  Cap failure criterion is considered to model the yielding of the  material during the process.  A large displacement based finite  element approach is used considering an updated Lagrangian strategy.

Title: Ductile tearing energy of sheet metals determined by the multiple  tensile testing (MTT) method
Abstract: Tearing energy of aluminium, copper and brass sheets, having  different mechanical characteristics, has been studied by the  multiple tensile testing (MTT) method.  In this method, different  test pieces of various gage lengths were employed.  The total energy  required to tear the specimens was assumed to be composed of two  components; one associated with uniform plastic deformation, which  occurs in the work-hardening range of the material, and the other  with post-uniform deformation and tearing which leads to the failure of the specimens.  Tearing energy was calculated by plotting the  total energy divided by the specimen cross-sectional area against  the gage length of the specimens.  In this plot, a straight line is  obtained, the intercept of which gives the value of tearing energy.   The results have been analyzed on the basis of the mechanical  characteristics of the materials. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.   All rights reserved.  18 Refs.

As the absolute temperature and temperature  uniformity of the silicon wafer are important parameters for  critical dimension control, special temperature considerations are  needed during the various steps in the lithography sequence.  The  desire to print smaller features on larger substrates has  necessitated more stringent wafer temperature control.  It is  becoming increasingly difficult to meet the tighter specifications  using the current practices because wafer temperature is usually not measured in-line.  Consequently, there are interest in developing  in-situ wafer temperature metrology.  This paper describes an  intelligent in-line temperature acquisition system for continuously  monitoring the wafer's spatial temperature distribution as well as  the conditions of the sensing elements.  Experimental results that  demonstrate the feasibility of utilising the self-heating test to  detect out-of-contact faults are presented.  7 Refs.

Title: Soft fault diagnosis in analog electronic circuits: Sensitivity  analysis by randomized algorithms
Abstract: In this paper a fault diagnosis technique for electronic analog  circuits is described.  Diagnosis is obtained by comparing  input-output measurements with examples contained in a fault  dictionary, by means of a neural classifier.  A harmonic analysis is  used, i.e. the test stimuli are sinusoidal waves.  A novel method for optimizing the fault dictionary construction is proposed.  In  particular, the stimuli selection is optimized by means of a  sensitivity analysis of the Circuit Under Test-CUT-relying on a  probabilistic approach based on randomized algorithms.  This  technique allows removing all the hypothesis assumed by the related  literature.  In fact it allows to remove the small perturbation  assumption and presents a poly-time solution independently from the  dimension of the perturbation.  5 Refs.

Title: Investigation into the effects of temperature cycling upon the solder joint connections at the board level of a variety of CSP packages
Abstract: This article describes the investigation and the results of that  investigation into the effects of temperature cycling upon solder  joint connections at the board level for a variety of Chip Scale  Packages (CSP's).  Variables studied were package construction,  package location on the circuit board, solder joint location on the  package, and printed circuit board type.  Temperature cycle  evaluations were conducted with real-time event monitoring and  failed sites were subjected to failure analysis to determine cause  of failure.  These analyses were conducted by the Failure Analysis  teams within Hewlett-Packard, Lucent Technologies, and Nortel  Networks as part of the CSP Reliability Characterization Project of  the HDP User Group International, Inc.

Title: Robustness of LDMOS power transistors in SOI-BCD processes and  derivation of design rules using thermal simulation
Abstract: In SOI devices, the buried oxide alters the thermal impedance  compared to a bulk device and a gives a higher temperature rise that influences the robustness of the device.  In this paper, power LDMOS  transistors (with integrated temperature sensors) in an SOI-process  are evaluated with Safe Operating Area (SOA) measurements.  The  failure mechanism, based on triggering of the parasitic bipolar, is  discussed with the aid of dynamic temperature measurements.  The  results show that the failure energy cart be related to a critical  temperature rise that depends on V//D//S.  Consequently, the thermal  impedance and V//D//S fully determine the failure energy.  Hence, 3D  thermal simulation can be used as a tool for dimensioning power  transistors.  A comparison of SOI-DMOS with bulk-DMOS and  bulk-Bipolar shows that in SOI it is still very well possible to  create power devices with a good SOA.  5 Refs.

Title: Dependence of plasma process induced damage on the transistor gate  area
Abstract: Until now, antenna ratio was considered one of the most important  parameters for plasma induced damage and tolerable antenna ratio is  very important for circuit designers to guarantee high yield  circuits.  In this paper, the dependence of plasma induced damage on  the gate area is characterized using novel test patterns.  The test  chip is fabricated using 0.15 mum CMOS technology with low-kappa IMD material.  The variation of gate current is used to detect the plasma induced damage.  It is shown that the failure rates of transistor  increase as the gate area in transistor increases although the  antenna ratio is maintained constant.  Therefore, to guarantee the  reliability of the gate oxide and transistors, we propose that the  dependence of plasma induced damage on gate area should be  considered when defining the maximum tolerable antenna ratio.  12  Refs.

Title: Persistence of granular structure during die compaction of ceramic  powders
Abstract: Glass spheres were used as a model system to investigate granule  failure during die compaction.  Stresses within an assembly of  spheres follow a network of pathways.  When the spheres are of  uniform composition, the magnitude of the stresses within a pair of  contacting granules is a function of the locally transmitted stress  and the diameter of the two spheres.  Results obtained using glass  spheres demonstrated the statistical nature of granule failure  during compaction, with some granules failing at very low applied  pressures while others ( similar to 40% by volume) persist at even  the highest applied loads.  Within a distribution of granule sizes,  those granules with smaller diameter were seen to have a higher  probability of failure at low pressure than were larger granules.   These results are consistent with those observed during die  compaction of granulated alumina powder.  5 Refs.

Title: Improvement of bearing strength of mechanically fastened composite  joints using fiber steering
Abstract: This paper reports an improvement in bearing strength by steering  fibers in composite laminates carrying a pin load hole.  The panels  have carbon fibers steered in the direction of the principal  stresses in the vicinity of the hole.  The steered fibers are placed  on pre-preg fabric plies creating hybrid layers in the laminates  using a fully digitized robot precision fiber steering technique.   The results are based on a preliminary set of specimens created to  prove the manufacturing technique.  The manufacturing trials relied  on resin bleed from the fabric to wet out the dry steered tows.   Other tests with a higher ratio of tow size to yam size returned  significantly larger increases in beating strength but required the  addition of resin.  9 Refs.

Title: Software aided failure analysis using ATPG tool
Abstract: Automatic Testpattern Generation (ATPG) is recommended in order to  get a high testcoverage quickly.  For failure analysis some standard  ATPG tools offer in addition a feature to perform fault diagnosis on full scan designs.  Software fault localization techniques become  more and more important in future designs, since in highly complex  VHDL programmed designs a standard analysis using functional test  vectors is expendable and time consuming.  This paper describes all  steps necessary for project setup and a flow for fault diagnosis.  In order to minimize the list of possible failures (given by the tool)  and to determine the physical location of the defect (x,y,z) a  failure localization flow is presented.  First results on IC's with  both failures purposely induced by Focused Ion Beam and real  production failures represents an excellent starting point for  further fault localization.  8 Refs.

Title: A dry migration? Copper dendrite growth in adhesive tape during  burn-in
Abstract: Copper Migration which exhibits dendrites short-circuit in  conductor-insulator-conductor structure may result in failure and  reliability problem in microcircuits.  Early works (1-6) have shown  this mechanism in moist conditions.  This is known as Wet Migration.   In this investigation, we have observed Copper Dendrite Growth  during burn-in stress in Adhesive Tape which was used for leadframes to maintain the co-planarity and stability of individual lead pins  during the manufacturing of semiconductor.  A special parallel  lapping technique revealed the dendrite growth under the tape.  It is believed that chemical interaction has taken place, especially due  to polyamic acid, which apparently reacts with copper.  Further  evaluations with higher temperature and voltage simulation confirm  this mechanism.  7 Refs.

Title: Application of passive voltage contrast and focused ion beam on  failure analysis of metal via defect in wafer fabrication
Abstract: A case on the application of passive voltage contrast (PVC) and  Focused Ion Beam (FIB) on failure analysis of metal interconnection  or Via defect in wafer fabrication was studied.  We have proposed a  simple, efficient and cost-saving identifying method of locating the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and more defective via in the via chain through the  FIB-induced PVC and its precise cross-sectioning.  Such technique  proves to be useful as it enables us to understand whether if all  the defective vias in the via chain exhibit the same failing  phenomenon or display any particular failing pattern which will  facilitate the failure analysis or process engineers to find out the failure mechanism.  2 Refs.

Title: Impact of ESD-induced soft drain junction damage on CMOS product  lifetime
Abstract: The impact of ESD-induced soft drain junction damage on product  lifetime was investigated.  Several thousand input-output (IO) pads  of a 0.35 mum CMOS IC were stressed by ESD (electrostatic discharge) and subsequently subjected to bakes, ESD re-stress and high  temperature operating life tests.  While the ESD-induced soft drain  junction damage appears to be stable versus temperature stress and  ESD-re-stress, it results in early failures during accelerated  operating life tests.  These lifetest failures are caused by  breakdown of the gate oxide which was left unbroken during the ESD  stress that caused the ESD-induced soft drain junction damage.  Thus, ESD-induced soft drain junction damage might cause a reliability  risk (latent ESD failure).  Consequently, it needs to be avoided by  assuring a sufficient robustness of the IC against this ESD damage  mechanism.  A leakage current criterion of 1 muA is rather large to  detect this kind of damage after ESD stress.  1 Refs.

Title: Response times in correcting non-normal system events when  collocating status, alerts and procedures, and controls
Abstract: Currently, most of the displays in control rooms can be categorized  as status, alerts/procedures, or control screens.  With the advent  and use of CRTs and the associated computing power available to  compute and display information, it is now possible to combine these different elements of information and control onto a single display.  An experiment was conducted to determine which, if any, of these  functions should be collocated in order to better handle simple  anticipated non-normal system events.  The results indicated that  there are performance benefits and subject preferences to combining  all the information onto one screen or combining the status and  alert/procedure information onto one screen and placing the controls in another area.  8 Refs.

Title: A micromechanical failure model for unidirectional fiber reinforced  composites
Abstract: Results from a newly developed model for failure in unidirectional  fiber reinforced composites based on fracture mechanics are  presented.  The model is based on (i) analysis of branch crack  initiation from the tip of an initial microcrack embedded in an  anisotropic material, which serves as a model for the fiber  reinforced composite and (ii) evaluation of anisotropy in  homogenized elastic material properties and fracture toughness.   Based on this model, failure envelope, dominant initial flaw  orientation and failure mode for unidirectional fiber reinforced  composites under a wide range of stress states are predicted.   Parametric study provides quantitative evaluation of the effect of  various mechanical and physical properties on the failure behavior,  and their influence on strength is identified.  Results from the  current model are compared with those of existing phenomenological  models, which show reasonable agreement. copy 2001 Elsevier Science  Ltd.  All rights reserved.  26 Refs.

Title: Composite specimen bearing failure reduction in losipescu shear tests
Abstract: ASTM Iosipescu shear test fixtures often crush the loaded edges of  high shear strength specimens before shear failure occurs between  the notches.  To alleviate this problem, two new shear test fixtures  were designed and built.  The first uses a pivoting load surface to  track the specimen shape as it changes under load.  The second uses a rounded load surface optimized to produce a uniform bearing pressure along the loaded edge of a quasi-isotropic sheet-molding compound  (SMC) specimen at shear failure.  Finite element analyses and strain  gage data are presented that describe the behavior of the baseline  ASTM, pivoting load surface and rounded load surface fixtures.  A  substantial reduction in bearing stress and edge crushing was  obtained with the rounded load surface fixture.  Additionally, the  modified surface optimized to test SMC specimens showed no tendency  to change the shear strength measured in other composite specimens.   10 Refs.

Title: Methodology and criterion for acrylic bone cement fatigue tests
Abstract: Acrylic bone cement is used as a fixing device in total hip  arthroplasty and it is based on polymethyl-methacrylate.  Fatigue  failure of the cement is the primary cause of loosening of cemented  arthroplasties.  Pores form in the acrylic material during mixing and curing, and an analysis of the fatigue life of the cement requires  the elimination of the critical macropores, defined as having a  diameter greater than 1 mm, which may bias the outcome of tests.   Previous workers have rejected fatigue specimens either on a  qualitative basis or at a specified pore size level.  However various different thresholds have been considered but currently there is no  quantitative criterion to define them.  This investigation proposes a quantitative criterion for establishing a critical macropore size  rejection threshold for fatigue specimens, and discusses the  effectiveness of this criterion based on fatigue tests of radiopaque cement specimens.

Title: Using torsional bar testing to determine fracture toughness
Abstract: A new method to determine fracture toughness K//I//C of materials is  introduced.  A round-rod specimen having a V-grooved spiral line with a 45 degree pitch is tested under pure torsion.  An equibiaxial  tensile/compressive stress state is effectively created to simulate  conventional test methods using a compact-type specimen with a  thickness equivalent to the full length of the spiral line.  K//I//C  values are estimated from the fracture load and crack length with  the aid of a three-dimensional finite element analysis.  K//I//C of  7475-T7351 aluminum is estimated to be 51.3 MPa root m, which is  higher than the vendor's value in the TL orientation by  approximately 0.8% and higher than 0.5T compact tension (CT) value  by 6%; A302B steel yields 54.9 MPa root m being higher than CT test  value by approximately 2%.  Good agreement between the K//I//C values obtained by different methods indicates the proposed method is sound and reliable.  (Author abstract) 17 Refs.

Title: Electromigration testing on via line structures with a SWEAT method  in comparison to standard package level tests
Abstract: Two electromigration test methods are compared with the aim to find  out if highly accelerated tests can be used to quantify the  reliability of metallization.  Experimental results show a good  correlation between wafer level (WL) SWEAT-and conventional standard package level (PL) tests on via terminated structures.  Similar  t//5//0//N values are obtained extrapolating the data from both  tests to norm conditions.  Failure analysis show the same failure  mechanism for both tests.  We found a difference in current density  exponent, which can partly be explained with an error in the  temperature determination of the failed metal line.  As a consequence the SWEAT method can not only be used for process monitoring but  also to quantify the reliability of metallization.  However the  difference in current density exponent needs further investigation.   (Author abstract) 7 Refs.

Title: Deep-censoring method for early reliability assessment
Abstract: Deep censoring is proposed as a direct method to assess the early  reliability of semiconductor products.  The method characterizes, in  particular, the early part of the failure-time distribution and is  described in the context of interconnect reliability and  electromigration.  In this context, it involves stressing a large  number of test lines only long enough for some small number of lines to fail, enough to characterize the percentiles of the failure-time  distribution that are of interest.  Simulations and other  calculations show that this approach offers the benefits of much  reduced test times and better confidence in sample estimates of  early percentiles and of sigma.  It can also be used to detect and  characterize extrinsic failure-time distributions.  An experimental  approach is proposed that uses special test structures with many  parallel-running test lines.  This makes possible early reliability  assessments at the wafer level with a full-wafer testing system.   (Author abstract) 6 Refs.

Title: Seismic reliability of masonry-infilled RC frames
Abstract: This study focuses on the probabilistic assessment of reinforced  concrete (RC) frames infilled with clay brick walls and subjected to earthquake loading.  The adopted methodology extends that previously  developed by the writers for bare RC frames by introducing  additional random variables to account for the uncertainty in the  masonry properties.  Quantification of the latter is achieved through the use of experimental data describing the difference in  force-displacement behavior between bare and infilled frames.  The  vulnerability and seismic reliability of two 10-story, three-bay  infilled frames (a fully infilled one and one with a soft ground  story) are derived and subsequently compared with values  corresponding to the bare frame counterpart.  It is found that  failure probabilities, especially at the ultimate limit state, are  highly sensitive to the structural stiffness; hence, bare frames  benefit from lower spectral ordinates than infilled ones.   Nonetheless, all structural systems studied appear to be exposed to  a reasonably low seismic risk.  (Author abstract) 27 Refs.

Title: Thermomicromechanical damage in composites
Abstract: A thermomicromechanical model of failure is presented based on  thermodynamic principles that is, using the balancing laws: the  conservation of momentum and the first and second laws of  thermodynamics.  The model is oriented toward damage initiation and  damage progression in a composite structure under an intense  pressure shock wave.  A micromechanical damage approach is considered where three damage modes are modeled: tensile damage, shear damage,  and interphase or material mismatch discontinuity between the  composite's matrix and fiber.  A homogenization technique is  incorporated in the development to simplify the representation of  the nonhomogeneons material.  A summary of the equations for the  thermomicromechanical model of failure is presented where a damage  parameter D is defined to characterize the lamina's damage based on  energy dissipation.  Numerical analyzes are presented to demonstrate  the model characterization to damage.  (Author abstract) 42 Refs.

Title: Fault diagnosis in air-conditioning systems: A multi-step fuzzy  model-based approach
Abstract: The problem of diagnosing faults in air-conditioning systems is of  increasing importance.  A brief review of heating, ventilating and  air-conditioning (HVAC) fault diagnosis schemes is given, the key  design issues are identified and the advantages of the fuzzy  model-based approach are summarised.  The way in which the fuzzy  fault diagnosis scheme is able to take account of modelling errors,  ambiguous data and sensor bias is explained.  A multi-step approach  to the fuzzy model-based approach is proposed that makes the results of the diagnosis less ambiguous.  A computer simulation study is used to demonstrate that a more precise diagnosis can be obtained using  the new scheme.  Experimental results are also presented that show  that the proposed scheme does not generate false alarms, when it is  used to commission an air-handling unit in a commercial office  building.  1 Refs.

Title: Efficiency of replacement of power devices installed in distribution  networks prior the final date of their technical service life
Abstract: The objective of this article is to evaluate the efficiency of  premature replacement of obsolete compressed-air and minimum-oil  circuit breakers, manufactured by Skoda and used in the 110 kV power distribution network, operated by the JME, a.s.  Brno (South Moravian Electricity, Plc.) utility, with the latest SF//6 circuit breakers  manufactured by Alstom, Siemens or ABB.  The new circuit breakers are assumed to feature higher reliability level and lower maintenance  costs.  The calculation uses data recommended by the manufacturer.   The maintenance of the old circuit breakers will still be optimized  by using the specified mathematical model.  The prematurity of the  replacement consists in the discarding of the old circuit breakers  five year prior the final date of their technical service life.  The  calculation deals with purely economic evaluation of the efficiency  of such a premature replacement.  5 Refs.

Title: Estimation of boundary points for continuum-state system reliability  measures
Abstract: A continuum-state system is considered, in which the performance  levels of the system and its components range from perfect  functionality to complete failure, allowing any intermediate state  in the arbitrary interval.  A number of recent papers on general  continuum-state system reliability are briefly reviewed.  A new  approach based on the universal generating function technique is  suggested for estimating boundary points of several reliability  measures for such systems.  It is shown, how the continuum-state  system can be approached by using a finite multi-state system and  how the bounds for the reliability measures may be found.  The  suggested procedure for estimating boundary points enables the  engineer to base only on a representation of an ordinary system  logic diagram.  Using formal procedures, one can get upper and lower  bounds for the entire continuum-state system reliability measures  with preliminary specified accuracy.  A numerical example for the  suggested approach is presented. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  19 Refs.

Title: ICEMS: A platform for advanced condition-based health management
Abstract: Health management of a machine, such as a gas turbine engine, offers  the potential benefits of efficient operations planning and reduced  cost of ownership.  It requires a tight integration of major health  management functions, such as trending, failure identification,  forecasting, life prediction, operations and maintenance planning.   Since 1985, the U. S. Air Force has been using a computer program to facilitate the trending and diagnostic functions for its engine  fleets.  This program is called Comprehensive Engine Trending and  Diagnostic System (CETADS).  Scientific Monitoring, Inc.  (SMI) has  been sponsored by the Air Force Research Laboratory to develop a  suite of compatible, plug-in tools to enhance CETADS.  These tools  are configured as software modules, and are collectively called the  Intelligent Condition-based Engine Management System (ICEMS).   Alternatively, ICEMS modules provide a comprehensive platform for  equipment or machinery health management.  In this implementation, it is a web-based infrastru cture for condition monitoring and asset  management.  5 Refs.

Title: Automated incremental design FMEA
Abstract: Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is typically a costly  manual process.  We present the EPOCH (Engineering Product and  Operations Cross-cutting Hybrid) Simulation for Failure Analysis  software, which automates generation of FMEA from design models.  The tool performs sets of scenario-based analyses, using the CONFIG  hybrid discrete event simulator, to generate reports summarizing  detailing analysis results.  The paper describes how the tool uses  this simulator, and how time-step modeling has be extended to handle failure cases that violate steady state assumptions and  approximations that are well founded for the nominal case.  The  automation supports incremental FMEA: Reporting how a design change  alters the presentation of the functional effects of failures, as  seen over a set of operational scenarios.  We describe the  representations of failure modes, scenario scripts and functional  labels that supports the capabilities of this tool.  An example is  presented, based on analysis of a propellant product ion plant for a planetary base.  11 Refs.

Title: A statistics of rare events method for transportation systems
Abstract: A method is proposed for quantifying the expected number of accidents for a transportation system during some operating period.  The  operating period is divided into two parts.  There is normal  operation where everything is working correctly.  These intervals can be studied deterministically by arguments-from-design or by tests.   There is unsafe operation where equipment has failed, an error has  occurred, or traffic perturbations have produced unusual  circumstances.  Such stochastic phenomena can be studied by  experiments or simulation.  These two types of operation create a  natural partition.  This paper proposes a Monte Carlo method based on this partition that appears appropriate for studying scarce events.   Estimators for this method are developed.  It is shown they are  unbiased, and confidence intervals derived.  There is also a  discussion of integrating random failures with traffic flow in a  discrete event simulation.  2 Refs.

Title: A new bearing fault detection and diagnosis scheme based on hidden  Markov modeling of vibration signals
Abstract: This paper introduces a new bearing fault detection and diagnosis  scheme based on hidden Markov modeling (HMM) of vibration signals.   First features are extracted from amplitude demodulated vibration  signals obtained from both normal and faulty bearings.  The features  are based on the reflection coefficients of the polynomial transfer  function of the auto-regressive model of the vibration signal.  These features are then used to train HMMs to represent various bearing  conditions.  The technique allows for online detection of faults by  monitoring the probabilities of the pre-trained HMM for the normal  case.  It also allows for the diagnosis of the fault by the HMM that  gives the highest probability.  The new scheme was tested with  experimental data collected from drive end ball bearing of an  induction motor (Reliance Electric 2HP IQPreAlert) driven mechanical system.  14 Refs.

Title: Use of importance sampling and related techniques to measure very  high reliability software
Abstract: Computer-based control systems have grown more complex over the past  two decades.  Thus, the software aspects of system reliability are an increasingly important concern.  Current methods of software and  system reliability prediction - whether measurement based or  incorporating reliability growth models - can not accurately predict failure rates of greater than 10**-**6 per mission hour.  This paper  describes a new methodology for more accurately predicting failure  rates of very high reliability systems.  The methodology enhances  conventional measurement-based reliability assessment with a method  incorporating the results of stress testing called importance  sampling.  By means of importance sampling in conjunction with a  system model, acceleration factors can be associated with stress  testing much as is currently done with elevated temperature life  testing of hardware components.  51 Refs.

Title: Adaptive resource management (ARM) middleware - the path for using  COTS in space
Abstract: Most COTS (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf) hardware and software are  designed to be used in benign environments, not the harsh  environment of space in which radiation effects, such as total dose  and the predominance of SEU (Single Event Upset) phenomena, have a  major impact on the design and operation of spacecraft and payloads.  One solution is to modify the COTS hardware and/or software to make  it space compatible.  This is a less desirable solution because once  it is modified, for all intents and purposes, it is no longer COTS.   An alternative solution is to develop an architecture which allows  the use of COTS hardware and software as is, while providing the  necessary fault tolerance and power management features not found in the commercial hardware and software.  This paper describes such an  architecture based on the ARM concept including identification of  the hooks, features, and interfaces needed to fly COTS in space.  7  Refs.

Title: Prognostics, the real issues involved with predicting life remaining
Abstract: This paper reviews the fundamentals of prognostics with emphasis on  the estimation of remaining life and the interrelations between  accuracy, precision and confidence.  A distinction is made between  the static view of failure distributions derived from historical  data and the dynamic view of remaining life derived from condition.   The non-stationary nature of prognoses is illustrated using data  from a failing SH-60 helicopter gearbox.  A method is demonstrated  that measures the accuracy and uncertainty of remaining life  estimates using example prognostic features.  This method isolates  the uncertainty attributable to features and their interpretation  from the uncertainty due to the random variables that govern the  physics of component failure.  Results from the example features  support a hypothesized trend of improved accuracy and lower  uncertainty as remaining life decreases.  3 Refs.

Title: Advanced diagnostics and prognostics for gas turbine engine risk  assessment
Abstract: Real-time, integrated health monitoring of gas turbine engines that  can detect, classify, and predict developing engine faults is  critical to reducing operating and maintenance costs while  optimizing the life of critical engine components.  Statistical-based anomaly detection algorithms, fault pattern recognition techniques  and advanced probabilistic models for diagnosing structural,  performance and vibration related faults and degradation can now be  developed for real-time monitoring environments.  Integration and  implementation of these advanced technologies presents a great  opportunity to significantly enhance current engine health  monitoring capabilities and risk management practices.  This paper  describes some novel diagnostic and prognostic technologies for  dedicated, real-time sensor analysis, performance anomaly detection  and diagnosis, vibration fault detection, and component prognostics.  The technologies have been developed for gas turbine engine health  monitoring and prediction applications which includes an array of  intelligent algorithms for assessing the total 'health' of an  engine, both mechanically and thermodynamically.  7 Refs.

Title: Achieving affordability through fuzzy reasoning and control
Abstract: One way to make a system more affordable is to reduce the number of  redundant components.  Reducing components while still maintaining a  desired level of reliability requires that the functionality of the  eliminated, redundant hardware be replaced with a lower-cost option.  In this paper, we present a methodology that offers such an option  on an aeropropulsion engine.  This option is a low-cost secondary  control unit with an intelligent logic that can be implemented as a  part of the engine health monitoring unit.  The low-cost, secondary  control unit acts like a back-up control, when the primary control  unit becomes faulty.  The back-up unit relies on the models and logic stored in the monitoring unit to provide a reduced-envelope  capability for the flight vehicle.  The basis for the logic is fuzzy  reasoning.  The reasoning is initiated by observing the behavior of  the engine before a fault is developed.  6 Refs.

Title: Real-time detection of developing cracks in jet engine rotors
Abstract: Test Devices has developed a unique method for detecting the  existence of dangerous cracks in turbine engine disks.  The system  uses the data from two distinct sensors, a radial position sensor  and an angular position reference signal.  By combining these two  data into a vector quantity, the system measures the displacement of the principal mass axis of the rotor.  A reasoner system uses the  change of principal mass axis to infer the presence of cracks.  It  does so by tracking changes in the unbalance as a function of the  operating cycle count.  The rate of change is compared with the known patterns of change produced by cracks as opposed to those produced  by normal wear phenomena and other benign effects.

Title: Diagnostic information fusion: Requirements flowdown and interface  issues
Abstract: In this paper we examine the implementation of a real-time,  diagnostic, information fusion algorithm, which achieves a more  accurate diagnostic estimate of system health than individual  estimates produced by a heterogeneous collection of diagnostic  tools.  We discuss an approach that both decomposes performance  requirements (through a flowdown) into the design and accommodates  the differences among the interfaces of a heterogeneous collection  of diagnostic tools.  We focus in particular on issues which arise  from an implementation which monitors system health in real-time and do not consider an off-line post-processing implementation.  Through  a systematic flowdown of performance requirements into the system  design, the combined effects of all the diagnostic tools are  considered in order to achieve the desired high level of accuracy  for each fault of interest.  7 Refs.

Title: Stress wave analysis of turbine engine faults
Abstract: Stress Wave Analysis (SWAN) provides real-time measurement of  friction and mechanical shock in operating machinery.  This high  frequency acoustic sensing technology filters out background levels  of vibration and audible noise, and provides a graphic  representation of machine health.  By measuring shock and friction  events, the SWAN technique is able to detect wear and damage at the  earliest stages and is able to track the progression of a detect  throughout the failure process.  This is possible because as the  damage progresses, the energy content of friction and shock events  increases.  This 'Stress Wave Energy' is then measured and tracked  against normal machine operating conditions.  This paper describes  testing that was conducted on several types of aircraft and  industrial gas turbine engines to demonstrate SWAN's ability to  accurately detect a broad range of discrepant conditions and  characterize the severity of damage.

Title: Prognostic framework software design tool
Abstract: The U.S.  Army Logistics Integration Agency has funded (1998-2000) the Advanced Technology Office (ATO), the U.S.  Army Test, Measurement,  Diagnostic Equipment Activity (USATA), the U.S.  Army AMCOM, to  develop a "Prognostics Framework".  This is a generic software  developmental tool set, open architecture capability to integrate  various prognostic mechanisms, and to provide operational and  logistic decision-making information.  The Prognostic Framework is a  horizontal technology and is tailorable to apply to new and existing systems.  This approach saves time and money.  It is the fastest to  converge on prognostics capabilities into manageable information for the systems operators, the maintenance crew, and logistics planners  across systems.  The Prognostic Framework, a system-level prognostic  manager, ties-in to logistics infrastructure (e.g.: IETM, logistics  planning, mission planning, statistical tools, spare parts  provisioning...).  Prognostics Framework is integrated with  Diagnostics to provide a total "Health Management Capability.  This  paper provides Prognostics Framework architecture, design approach,  and interfaces capabilities.  8 Refs.

Title: Determining consensus numbers
Abstract: Conditions on a shared object type T are given that are both  necessary and sufficient for wait-free n-process consensus to be  solvable using objects of type T and registers.  The conditions apply to two large classes of deterministic shared objects:  read-modify-write objects [C.  P. Kruskal, L. Rudolph,  and M. Snir, ACM Trans.  Prog.  Lang.  Syst., 10 (1988), pp.  579-601 ] and readable objects, which have operations that allow processes to read the state of the object.  These classes include  most objects that are used as the primitives of distributed systems.  When the sequential specification of T is finite, the conditions may be checked in a finite amount of time to decide the question "Is the consensus number of T at least n?" The conditions are also used to  provide a clear proof of the robustness of the consensus hierarchy  for read-modify-write and readable objects.  24 Refs.

Title: Reliable regulation in the presence of bounded exogenous signals
Abstract: This paper addresses the design of a reliable control system for a  linear, asymptotically stable plant.  Specifically, the considered  problem consists of finding a compensator which, besides guaranteing closed loop asymptotic stability and zero error regulation for  bounded exogenous signals when all the instrumentation behaves  properly, also ensures that these properties are preserved, at their maximum possible extent, when some sensor and/or actuator failures  occur, that is, some of the feedback loops open.  Thus, a unique  regulator has to be found, able to contemporarily solve a certain  number of classical regulator problems.  Having presented solvability conditions for both centralized and decentralized control  structures, explicit expressions for the relevant regulators are  given.  These regulators are of the least order, characterized by a  small gain and supply the control systems with a generalized form of the unconditional stability property.  11 Refs.

Title: H// infinity controller for vehicle lateral control under fault in  front or rear sensors
Abstract: This paper presents the design of lateral controllers for automated  vehicles under specific sensor fault.  The specific fault refers to  the failure of one of the two sets of sensors on-board the vehicle  which are critical to vehicle lateral control.  The aim of the  controller design is to accomplish sound performance with the  remaining set of sensors.  The current vehicle lateral controller,  which works with the two sets of sensors, is examined and its  ineffectiveness under sensor failures is described.  Controllers with one set of sensors are designed using the H// infinity optimal  control theory.  Two controllers are derived, each using one set of  the two sets of sensors.  Simulation results are presented to  demonstrate the effectiveness of the controllers.  7 Refs.

Title: An LMI approach to the design of fault detection filter for  time-delay LTI systems with unknown inputs
Abstract: In this paper, robust fault detection (FD) problems for time-delay  LTI systems with unknown inputs are studied.  The basic idea of our  study is to express the robustness as well as the sensitivity of  residual signals to the unknown inputs as well as to the faults in  terms of L//2-gain and, based on it, to formulate the design of  fault detection filters as an optimization problem.  Applying H//  infinity optimization technique, an LMI approach to the solution of  the optimization problem is then proposed.  The main results consist  in the derivation of the existence conditions of the fault detection filter for the time-delay LTI systems and further the solution of  the optimal design problem.  17 Refs.

Title: Decoupling of failed actuators in flight control systems
Abstract: In this paper, an approach for predesigning controllers for a  switching control scheme for systems undergoing actuator failures is proposed.  Controller predesign for actuator failures is not trivial  as the values at which the failed actuators freeze is not known a  priori.  The actuators failed at a non zero position, act as  persistent disturbances significantly altering the system dynamics.   The controller design in this paper is accomplished by using  disturbance decoupling approach which ensures complete rejection of  the disturbances caused by actuator failures in the steady state.   The design is completed using linear quadratic control to address  the transient response.  The design procedure is demonstrated on a  multiple actuator failure of an aircraft carrier landing system.  17  Refs.

Title: Robust supervisory fault-tolerant flight control system
Abstract: In this paper we present a new supervisory scheme for robust on-line  Failure Detection and Identification (FDI) and Adaptive  Reconfigurable Control (ARC) in the presence of multiple control  effector failures.  The scheme, based on Adaptive Interacting  Multiple Observers (AIMO), substantially reduces the computational  requirements compared to the previous designs, and increases the  robustness of the overall system by controlling the plant with a  fixed robust controller most of the time.  The feasibility of the  proposed design was demonstrated through nonlinear simulations of  F/A-18C/D aircraft during carrier landing in the presence of battle  damage and failures of flight-critical subsystems and components.  In particular, we demonstrate the accomodation of a multiple failure  that includes 50% left stabilator damage, rudder lock-in-place, and  a large external disturbance.  17 Refs.

Title: An adaptive actuator failure compensation controller using output  feedback
Abstract: An adaptive control scheme using output feedback for output tracking  is developed for systems with unknown actuator failures that some  unknown inputs are stuck at some unknown fixed values at unknown  time instants.  An effective controller structure is proposed which  achieves desired plant-model output matching when implemented with  matching parameters and asymptotic output tracking when implemented  with adaptive parameter estimates.  A completely parameterized linear error equation is obtained based on which a stable adaptive law is  derived for parameter adaptation in the presence of parameter  uncertainties.  All closed-loop signals are bounded and the plant  output tracks a given reference output asymptotically, despite the  uncertainties in actuator failures and plant parameters, as shown  analytically and by simulation results from a case study of yaw rate control of Boeing 747 lateral dynamics.  13 Refs.

Title: Neural adaptive control of LoFLYTE registered trademark
Abstract: A major goal in flight control over the past decade has been the  development of reconfigurable flight control systems which can adapt their gains in real-time to compensate for aircraft damage and  in-flight system failures.  The purpose of this paper is to describe  the controller developed for the LoFLYTE registered trademark  aircraft, which is a testbed for neural networks research.

Title: Fault tolerant control systems design with consideration of  performance degradation
Abstract: In this paper, an integrated design for Fault Tolerant Control  Systems (FTCS), with consideration of performance degradation, is  proposed.  The design objectives, specifications, performance  measures, and the consideration of graceful performance degradation  are investigated.  Three intervals in FTCS and their associated  performance characteristics are presented.  Guidelines for selecting  reference models for the purpose of determining design  specifications are discussed, a model-following adaptive design  methodology is coupled with a jointly designed Fault Detection and  Diagnosis (FDD) scheme to achieve desired performance.  The  reconfigurable feedback controller is designed automatically using  an eigenstructure assignment technique, while reconfigurable  feedforward controllers are designed using a model-following  methodology.  The design objectives and the proposed integrated  approach have been demonstrated and evaluated using an aircraft  example.  12 Refs.

Title: Optimal control law for fault tolerant control systems in noisy  environment
Abstract: An optimal control law is synthesized for Fault Tolerant Control  Systems with Markovian Parameters (FTCSMP) in noisy environment.   Three types of noise are considered: state-dependent,  control-dependent and purely additive Gaussian noise.  In particular, conditions for the existence of an optimal control law in the finite time horizon are derived.  The limiting behavior of the cost  function, the Riccati-like and the covariance-like differential  equations is studied.  The conditions that guarantee the finiteness  of the cost function and the existence of steady-state solutions,  for both Riccati-like and covariance-like differential equations,  are stated and verified.  A computational algorithm is constructed  for both finite and infinite time horizons.  It is shown that under  certain conditions, the algorithm converges to constant optimal  control gains.  The theoretical results are illustrated by a  numerical example.  8 Refs.

Title: Effects of fault detection and isolation to the stability of fault  tolerant control systems
Abstract: In this paper the effect of detection delays and errors on the  stochastic stability of Fault Tolerant Control Systems with  Markovian Parameters (FTCSMP) is studied.  A mathematical  representation for the detection delays of a Fault Detection and  Isolation (FDI) process is developed.  FDI processes employing  memory-less statistical and sequential tests are considered.  The  dynamic programming principle is used to minimize a stochastic cost  function and to obtain an optimal control law.  Both the failure  process and the FDI process are assumed to be available for the  controller.  Therefore, the designed controller allows the  consideration of errors in fault detection.  It is shown that the  stability of FTCSMP may be lost in the event of large detection  delays or errors in detection.  A numerical example is used to  demonstrate the theoretical developments.  10 Refs.

Title: Fault diagnosis for non-mininum phase systems using H// infinity  optimization
Abstract: Analysis and design algorithms for residual generators for non  minimum phase systems are given.  It is shown that H// infinity  optimization of residual generators applied directly to systems  including non minimum phase zeros can be very conservative.  To  remove this conservatism in the H// infinity optimization of the  residual generators, a factorization of the non minimum phase system into a minimum phase part and an all-pass factor including the non  minimum phase zeros can be applied.  The optimization of the residual generator can then be done with respect to the minimum phase part of the system only.  It is shown that the effect from the all-pass  factor will not affect the 2-norm of the residual vector.  15 Refs.

Title: Predictive reliability assessment of distribution systems including  extreme adverse weather
Abstract: The physical environment in which a distribution system resides has a major effect on the resulting reliability of the network.  The  physical stress placed on system components can be much higher in  bad weather than that encountered under normal weather conditions.   The conventional approach to incorporate bad weather in the  predictive assessment of redundant transmission line facilities is  to divided the overall weather conditions into the two states of  normal and adverse weather.  This paper illustrates the conventional  approach to predictive reliability assessment using a two-state  weather model and extends these concepts to recognize extremely  adverse weather conditions.  The resulting three-state weather model  is presented and analyzed to illustrate the applicability of the  model and the impact of dividing bad weather into the two categories of adverse and major adverse weather.  8 Refs.

Abstract: Bonding plates to reinforced concrete (RC) structures is a  mechanically efficient form of retrofitting that is also inexpensive and unobtrusive.  However, bonding plates to RC structures is an  extremely complex engineering problem as research has shown that  bonded plates are prone to about 30 mechanisms of failure.  This  paper describes the various techniques of plating that are now  available for retrofitting, illustrates some of the various failure  mechanisms that can occur and the development of their design rules, and discusses the choices between adhesive bonding and bolting, and  the choice between steel and fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) plating. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: Study of composite compressive properties due to biaxial deformation  of the weft-knitted glass fabrics
Abstract: The effect of biaxially deforming a weft-knit Milano rib fabric on  the overall composite compressive properties has been studied for a  glass/vinyl-ester knitted composite.  A range of combinations of  wale-course stretch ratios was considered.  It was found that the  compression properties of these structures, on the whole, appeared  to be closer to isotropic and relatively insensitive to fabric  deformation.  This observation is believed to be due to the dominance of the matrix properties.  Despite not detecting any gross changes in the knit structure, it is believed that some redistribution and  reorientation of the fibres did occur during fabric deformation,  which in turn altered the relative contents and/or directionality of the fibres in the composites.  A feature of the compressive failure  was kinking of the highly bent yarns, particularly in resin rich  regions having reduced lateral support for yarns. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: Damage-mechanics analysis of matrix cracking in cross-ply CFRP  laminates under thermal fatigue
Abstract: Microscopic damage development in high-temperature CFRP, AS4/PEEK  cross-ply laminates under thermal cycling has been investigated.  Two types of laminate configurations were tested to discuss the effect  of ply thickness.  Matrix cracks initiated in both 0 and 90 degree  plies and the number of cracks increased as the number of cycles  increased.  The number of cracks in the stable growth region were  twice as great as in a 90 degree ply.  To discuss these experimental  results, a damage-mechanics analysis was used to evaluate the  energy-release rate associated with cracking and thermal residual  stress in cracked ply.  It was clear that a modified Paris law  approach is effective for thin plies and an average-stress approach  is effective for thick plies. copy 2001 Published by Elsevier  Science Ltd.

Title: A load-capacity interference model for common-mode failures in  1-out-of-2: G systems
Abstract: Summary and Conclusions-Load-capacity (stress-strength) interference  theory is used to model the time-dependent behavior of a 1-out-of-2: G redundant system and to examine common-mode failures.  For single  units subjected to Poisson distributed load arrivals, the random  failures, infant mortality, and aging are associated with load  variability, capacity variability, and capacity deterioration,  respectively.  This paper extends the analysis to a redundant system  by using a Markov model to treat Poisson distributed loads arriving  at units simultaneously.  Loss of s-independence of the unit failures is analyzed with joint pdfs of load and capacity.  In the rare-event  approximation, the degree of redundancy loss is characterized by  expressing the coefficient in the beta-factor method in terms of the load and capacity distributions.  7 Refs.

Title: The application of some non-linear methods in rotating machinery  fault diagnosis
Abstract: In this paper, some non-linear diagnostic methods for rotating  machinery are introduced and evaluated from the view of diagnostic  practice.  The methods are pseudo-phase portrait, singular spectrum  analysis and correlation dimension.  The pseudo-phase portrait is  simple, easy to draw, and is sensitive to some fault types.  Singular spectrum analysis can reveal the complexity of a signal.  By means of singular spectrum analysis one can reduce the noise of a signal.   Correlation dimension can provide some intrinsic information of an  underlying dynamical system, and can be used to classify different  faults intelligently.  Examples show that all these methods are  advantageous in the field of non-linear diagnostics.  Therefore, it  is quite reasonable for effective fault diagnosis to use non-linear  diagnostic methods in addition to the methods currently used, such  as orbit portrait, FFT spectra, time-frequency analysis, etc. 23  Refs.

Title: Wavelets for detecting mechanical faults with high sensitivity
Abstract: A method of detecting transients in mechanical systems by matching  wavelets with associated signal is proposed, leading to a  development of joint time-frequency-scale distribution.  The three  variables, the time, frequency and scale, have maximized the chance  for finding similar signal segments from a system under inspection.   The sensitivity is shown to be very high due to closer matching and  better choice of wavelet shapes, which is essential for early fault  detection and failure prevention.  Fundamental types of wavelets are  introduced based on the shapes of widely encountered system  responses.  A method of processing the three-dimensional image is  suggested for interpreting the time-frequency-scale wavelet map,  where the properties of the object patterns uncover the features of  a signal source, so as to understand the defect and to indicate the  condition of a diagnosed system.  The joint distribution is  demonstrated to be useful in detecting transients from different  mechanical systems.  Implementation and examples are discussed.  12  Refs.

Abstract: It is studied the fatigue crack growth behavior of two grades of  WC-Co cemented carbides, both with a 10%//w//t of Co but with  different carbide grain size, 0,8 and 2,5 mum.  Crack-growth  kinetics, measured under different load ratios, is described using  an alternative form to the Paris equation.  Hence, it is used a model that takes into account both maximum and range of the applied stress intensity factor, K//m//a//x and DeltaK respectively, within an  equation of the form da/dN= f(K//m//a//x, DeltaK).  It is observed a  significant dependence with respect to K//m//a//x, yielding evidence of the prominence of static modes of rupture.  Under these  considerations, the fatigue crack growth sensitivity of the  materials studied is evaluated.  Finally, the damage mechanisms  associated with stable and unstable fatigue crack propagation are  analyzed.  11 Refs.

A  numerical study using smoothed particle hydrodynamics scheme is  promising since the major distinguishing features of composite  armour systems such as, projectile erosion, crack propagation,  ceramic conoid formation and failure of backing plate, are  successfully captured.  Simulation results for ballistic limits  appear to match fairly well with the test values and reveal an  optimum value of the front plate to back plate thickness ratio. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: A variational calculus approach to optimal checkpoint placement
Abstract: Checkpointing is an effective fault-tolerant technique for improving  system availability and reliability.  However, a blind checkpointing  placement can result in either performance degradation or expensive  recovery cost.  By means of the calculus of variations, we derive an  explicit formula that links the optimal checkpointing frequency with a general failure rate, with the objective of globally minimizing  the total expected cost of checkpointing and recovery.  Theoretical  result shows that the optimal checkpointing frequency is  proportional to the square root of the failure rate and can be  uniquely determined by the failure rate (time-varying or constant)  if the recovery function is strictly increasing and the failure rate is lambda( infinity ) greater than 0. Bruno and Coffman [2] suggest that optimal checkpointing by its nature is  a function of system failure rate, i.e., the time-varying failure  rate demands time-varying checkpointing in order to meet the  criteria of certain optimality.  The results obtained in this paper  agree with their viewpoint.  25 Refs.

Title: Measurement validation via expected uncertainty
Abstract: Validated sensor data is critical to the operation of a modern  process plant as erroneous data can degrade process performance.   Consequently measurement validation is a necessary part of process  management.  Self-validating sensors reference observed sensor  performance against a local model of ideal sensor behaviour.   Discrepancies between the observed and desired sensor response are  used to resolve faulty sensor operation and indicate the resultant  measurement quality.  However, non-ideal aspects of the validation  problem lack treatment in many existing self-validation methods and  require the validated-measurement model to have a probabilistic  foundation.  This paper prescribes a formal basis for integrating  non-ideal diagnostic information into a stochastic model of sensor  operation.  The analysis is presented in the context of an existing  self-validation framework with a mass-flow simulation illustrating  the concept. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: Microstructure and adhesion characteristics of diamond-like carbon  films deposited on steel substrates
Abstract: For tribological applications, the low friction coefficient and high  microhardness of diamond-like carbon (DLC) films give significant  advantages in cutting and forming non-ferrous materials.  The  inherently large residual stress of DLC films, however, prevents the depositing of thicker films.  This study designed and implemented a  compound interface, comprising a series of metal, metal nitride, and metal carbonitride interlayers deposited in a graded structure,  between the DLC (a metal-doped a-C:H) film and M2 steel substrates.   The tribological performance of the interface was evaluated using a  scratch tester and ball-on-disk tribometer.  Meanwhile, the failure  mechanism of DLC deposited on M2 steel substrates was examined using SEM/EDS and TEM microscopy.  Experimental results demonstrate an  improved DLC hard coating with superior adhesion strength on the  steel substrates. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights  reserved.  15 Refs.

Title: Modeling of finger-joint failure in glued-laminated timber beams
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to the modeling of failure of  finger-joints in glued-laminated beams.  A nonlinear strain-softening model with stochastic material parameters was used to characterize  the failure zone of the finger-joint.  Monte Carlo simulations of the behavior of laminations with finger-joints and of laminated beams  were performed using the finite-element method.  Various lamination  thicknesses and beam depths were investigated, as well as the effect of varying the ductility of the finger-joint.  Finally, the use of  simplified finger-joint material models was also investigated.  The  results show that the proposed approach can account for such  phenomena as the size effect and the laminating effect.  Another  observation is that the finger-joint ductility has a major influence on the lamination and beam strength, and that a special case of the  present modeling approach can be made to coincide with the classic  weakest link theory of Weibull.  22 Refs.

Title: Evaluation of critical interfacial friction in cross wedge rolling
Abstract: For the purpose of characterizing excess initial slip, the critical  value of interfacial friction in the cross wedge rolling (CWR)  process is investigated.  After describing CWR and its failure  mechanisms, an analytical method is presented for determining the  critical friction condition in a cross wedge rolling process.  Using  specialized pin-on-disk experiments, a technique is then introduced  for determining the actual friction coefficient in a CWR operation.   By comparing the critical and experimental friction coefficient  values, a procedure for predicting the likelihood of excess  interfacial slip failure in cross wedge rolling is established.  The  validity of such a procedure is subsequently ascertained for a  specific set of operating conditions using the finite element method and CWR prototype experiments.  14 Refs.

Title: Flexural capacity of glass FRP strengthened concrete masonry walls
Abstract: Fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) can provide a strengthening  alternative for unreinforced and underreinforced masonry.  The ease  with which FRP can be installed on the exterior of a masonry wall  makes this form of strengthening attractive to the owner,  considering both reduced installation cost and down time of the  occupied structure.  Six unreinforced concrete masonry walls (four at 1.8 m tall and two at 4.7 m tall) were tested in out-of-plane  flexure up to capacity.  The walls were strengthened with glass FRP  composite composed of unidirectional E-glass fabric with an epoxy  matrix.  The composite was adhered to the surface of the masonry  using the same epoxy with the fibers oriented perpendicular to the  bed joints.  General flexural strength design equations are presented and compared with the results of the testing.  It was found that the  equations overpredicted the actual capacity of the test specimens by no more than 20%.  22 Refs.

Title: Study on the post-buckling behavior of laminates connected by rivets
Abstract: The present study employs a numerical approach to investigate the  post-buckling behavior of laminates connected by rivets.  In order to reduce the calculation time, the rivets are replaced with springs,  while the stiffness of the springs is induced from the study that  analyzes the bending behavior and the interaction between the rivet  and the laminate.  The finite element software ABAQUS is used to  inspect the post-buckling behavior of composite laminates connected  by rivets.  Several parameters are considered like the stacking  sequence, the arrangement of the rivets, and the span between the  stiffener.  In all these cases, springs can fully present the  behavior around the rivets.  Finally, the validity of this method is  verified by experiment.  9 Refs.

Title: Strengthening silica prepared by sol-gel chemistry by inclusion of a  polyamidoamine dendrimer
Abstract: Silica prepared from tetramethyl orthosilicate by an acid-catalyzed  sol-gel process is strengthened by inclusion of a generation-zero  polyamidoamine (G0-PAMAM) dendrimer in the precursor sol.  Evidence  is provided by impact test and rupture strength measurements.  Impact mean failure energies are 17 and 30 mJ for undoped and doped silica, respectively.  The corresponding rupture strengths are 32.9 and 41.6  MPa.  Also measured is the Knoop Hardness Number (KHN) for the  undoped and PAMAM-doped silica.  The KHN values are indistinguishable among the undoped and doped sol-gels and are within 15% of that  reported for borosilicate glass.  Doping with generation-4 PAMAM does not strength the gels.  A model is proposed whereby the G0-PAMAM  crosslinks the silica and G4-PAMAM serves as a templating agent that leads to larger colloidal particles.  Atomic force microscopy of the  surface features of the silica supports the hypothesis.  11 Refs.

Comparing the  self-destruction arts often used in bomblet fuzes both here and  abroad, two different centrifugal self-destruction structures are  introduced, which respectively make use of ballistic and centrifugal environment characteristics of spin bomblet upon impacting the  target, and their merits and faults are analyzed.  2 Refs.

Title: Recursive bifurcation of tensile steel specimens
Abstract: Failure modes of steel specimens subjected to uniaxial tension are  investigated.  These modes are well known to display complex  geometrical characteristics of deformation accompanied by the  plastic instability behavior.  As an underlying mechanism of such  complexity, we here focus on the recursive occurrence of  bifurcations.  In the theory, the rule of recursive bifurcation of a  rectangular parallelepiped domain is obtained by the group-theoretic bifurcation theory so as to exhaust all the mathematically possible  courses of bifurcation.  In the experiment, we examine the  representative failure modes with reference to the rules to identify actual courses of recursive bifurcation.  Three-dimensional finite  element analysis of a thin specimen is conducted to observe the  recursive bifurcation, in which diffuse necking is formed by the  direct bifurcation and the single shear band by the secondary  bifurcation.  The recursive bifurcation has thus been identified as  the mechanism to create the complex failure modes. copy 2001  Elsevier Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  24 Refs.

Title: Identification of damage in beam and plate structures using  parameter-dependent frequency changes
Abstract: Damage of a structure affects its stiffness properties and induces a  shift in the free frequency spectrum.  In the paper, an additional  parameter is introduced, such as concentrated elastic or rigid  support and mass.  The evolution of natural frequencies is analyzed  for varying parameter values with respect to damage location.  This  frequency variation is used in assessing the location and magnitude  of damage by introducing the damage indices or by solving the  identification problem requiring the minimization of the parameter  dependent distance functional.  The first part of the paper is  concerned with the sensitivity analysis of damage indices with  respect to support or mass location.  The second part deals with the  identification problem for which the specific examples are treated.   24 Refs.

The extraction method is based on series expansion of the signal by a set of elementary functions.  The exponentially  decayed sinusoidal functions are suitable for simulating transient  impulse responses of mechanical system.  Hence, they are used as the  elementary functions.  A matching pursuit algorithm is applied to  decompose the signal into linear composition of event-related  impulse responses that could be correlated to the elementary  functions.  Fault diagnosis for a reciprocating compressor using this new method is illustrated.  The result shows that the extracted  features can effectively represent faults in the reciprocating  machinery.  4 Refs.

Title: Creep properties of Sn-Ag solder joints containing intermetallic  particles
Abstract: The creep behavior of the eutectic tin-silver joints and tin-silver  composite solder joints containing 20 vol.% of Cu//6Sn//5,  Ni//3Sn//4, and FeSn//2 intermetallic reinforcements introduced by  in-situ methods was investigated.  These creep tests were carried out using single shear lap solder joints at room temperature, 85 degree  C, and 125 degree C. The creep resistance was similar in magnitude  for all alloys, and with increasing temperature, the stress  exponents decreased in a manner consistent with power-law break-down behavior.  The FeSn//2, intermetallic reinforced composite solder was found to be the most creep-resistant alloy at room temperature.   Creep failure was observed to occur within the solder matrix in all  these solder joints.  Although a detailed analysis of the processes  involved was difficult because of smearing of the features in the  fracture surface, there were indications of grain-boundary  separation, ductile fracture, and interfacial separation.  21 Refs.

Title: The management of threat events
Abstract: The management of the events which threaten life, property, the  community or the environment were analyzed.  The threat events make  demands, both financial and human, on the decision makers when  controlling or co-ordinating resources in response to such events.   Decision makers need to use their leadership qualities to plan,  train, exercise and evaluate their procedures to understand the  evolution of threat events from initiation through to the desired  successful conclusion.  The latest technologies enable computer  representation of the real world, rather than having to rely upon  real exercises which allows decision makers to explore various  threat events in safe environment, and assess the scale and  necessary reactions to the event.

Title: Service discovery in DEAPspace
Abstract: The DEAPspace group at IBM Research, Zurich Lab is developing a  system in which services can be shared between proximate devices.   The target environment is single-hop short-range wireless systems,  and the solution must offer prompt responsiveness for transient  devices.  In this article, the service discovery algorithm is  presented.  Through this new algorithm, a computing device can detect the presence of neighboring devices, share configuration and service information with those devices, and also notice when devices become  unavailable.  Targeted for wireless ad hoc single-hop networks, this  solution improves the responsiveness of devices to changes in their  environments.  The effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated  through comparison with others that achieve similar goals,  considering the responsiveness to changes in the local environment,  power consumption, and bandwidth requirement of devices.  11 Refs.

Title: PiNet: Wireless connectivity for organizational information access  using lightweight handheld devices
Abstract: In order to support connectivity requirements for today's pervasive  devices, a new type of wireless network is needed.  Pervasive  Information Network (PiNet) is a new wireless connectivity  architecture designed to support access to organizational  information using lightweight handheld devices.  PiNet's main  objective is to support a mass-market-type application, where  thousands of users can simultaneously have interactive access to a  variety of organizational information sources while maintaining a  short response time and using a simple, low-cost, power-limited  pervasive device.  This article summarizes the necessary  characteristics of PiNet and presents a survey of the existing main  technologies, explaining how they fall short of providing a total  solution for pervasive wireless networks.  In conclusion, this  document indicates the direction that must be taken in order to  design a solution that will provide a large number of users with a  practical means of obtaining information in a timely manner.  7 Refs.

Title: Automatic 3D city construction system using omni camera
Abstract: Video analysis and mixed reality (MR) systems, which integrate the  virtual world and the real world, are important topics of multimedia research.  In this paper, we propose an efficient 3D city  construction system from omni video data as a practical application  of MR systems.  To develop this system, two main methods are proposed for analyzing omni video data.  The first one is omniEPI analysis,  which makes it possible to obtain 3D information from omni video  data robustly and efficiently.  The second method is omniPVI  analysis, which makes it possible to obtain not only front images of the buildings but also side images of them.  To demonstrate the  effectiveness of these methods, we present some experimental results and the prototype systems using outdoor environment omni video data.  7 Refs.

Title: Towards a multimodal meeting record
Abstract: Face-to-face meetings usually encompass several modalities including  speech, gesture, handwriting, and person identification.  Recognition and integration of each of these modalities is important to create  an accurate record of a meeting.  However, each of these modalities  presents recognition difficulties.  Speech recognition must be  speaker and domain independent, have low word error rates, and be  close to real time to be useful.  Gesture and handwriting recognition must be writer independent and support a wide variety of writing  styles.  Person identification has difficulty with segmentation in a  crowded room.  Furthermore, in order to produce the record  automatically, we have to solve the assignment problem (who is  saying what), which involves people identification and speech  recognition.  This paper will examine a multimodal meeting room  system under development at Carnegie Mellon University that enables  us to track, capture and integrate the important aspects of a  meeting from people identification to meeting transcription.  Once a  multimedia meeting record is created, it can be archived for later  retrieval.  15 Refs.

Title: Toward a retrieval of HTML documents using a semantic approach
Abstract: The growth of the Internet produces a lot of advantages together with the opportunity to provide different people with access to a large  warehouse of information.  However, this phenomenon produces some  difficulties in the activities of searching and retrieving.  A large  amount of information is, sometimes, useless if it does not offer  tools to respond to the information needs of the user.  The goal of  this paper is to introduce an approach devoted to facilitating the  information access and retrieval using Web syntactic structures and  semantic organization.  We consider the HTML language syntactic  structure, the organization of information in a general Web  document, and we define some rules that people use for structuring  Web information.  These rules can be used for managing and retrieving Web information and its semantic.  A Web document is treated as a  complex informative object formed by images, tables, animations,  videos, and text organized into chapters, paragraphs, titles, and so on, connected according to semantic links.  Knowledge associated with the information structure helps in retrieving relevant information.   10 Refs.

Title: Video segmentation using spatial and temporal statistical analysis  method
Abstract: Video segmentation is a critical component for video shot detection,  video data analysis and information retrieval.  In this paper, a new  statistical method for video segmentation based on the spatial and  temporal analysis of the video data is proposed.  A statistical  hypothesis testing framework is described for video shot detection  and video sequence segmentation.  The proposed approach is based on  the salient statistical features utilizing both local and global  spatial and temporal informations in the video image sequence.  The  statistical hypothesis testing framework in our approach provides a  flexible way of handling the variabilities of the video data, and it avoids the pitfalls of heuristic methods of pre-defined threshold in traditional frame-difference and histogram based approaches.  This  algorithm is applied to real-time broadcasting news video and movie  video clips.  Experimental results indicate that the proposed  algorithm is more robust than previous approaches.  Significant  performance improvements are observed and the efficacy of the  algorithm is verified on the real unconstrained video sequence.  6  Refs.

Title: Benchmarking access structures for the similarity retrieval of  high-dimensional multimedia data
Abstract: In multimedia databases it is usual to map objects into feature  vectors in high-dimensional spaces.  In order to speed query  processing access structures, or indices, are required.  Classical  spatial access structures such as the R*-tree are bound to fail when the space dimensional is not low.  Fortunately, several access  structures for high dimensional spaces, e.g., the SS-tree, SR-tree  and M-tree have been proposed.  However, each of those structures  have been benchmarked in a rather ad-hoc manner.  This paper  benchmarks and compares all above structures using a real dataset of 40,000 high-dimensional objects.  All structures have been  implemented on top of the GiST infrastructure to minimize the risk  of implementation bias.  Even though no structure can be claimed to  be the undisputed winner, we have found that the SR-tree presents  the best overall results.  12 Refs.

Title: Information access using speech, speaker and face recognition
Abstract: We describe a scheme to combine the results of audio and face  identification for multimedia indexing and retrieval.  Audio analysis consists of speech and speaker recognition derived from broadcast  news video clip.  The video component is analyzed to identify the  persons in the same video clip using face recognition.  When applied  individually both speaker and face recognition schemes have  limitations on conditions under which they perform reasonably well.   By integrating the match-score results of both audio and video  analysis, we find that the two techniques can complement each other.  We discuss the system architecture for such a combined system, and  discuss how decision fusion is applied to disparate match-scoring  systems to yield the final speaker identity.  5 Refs.

Title: A probabilistic framework for semantic indexing and retrieval in  video
Abstract: This paper proposes a probabilistic framework for semantic indexing  and retrieval in digital video.  The components of the framework are  multijects and multinets.  Multijects are probabilistic multimedia  objects representing semantic features or concepts.  A multinet is a  probabilistic network of multijects which accounts for the  interaction between concepts.  The main contribution of this paper is a Bayesian multinet which enhances the detection probability of  individual multijects, provide a unified framework for integrating  multiple modalities and supports inference of unobservable concepts  based on their relation with observable concepts.  We develop  multijects for detecting sites (locations) in video and integrate  the multijects using a multinet in the form of a Bayesian network.   Experiments reveal significant performance improvement using the  multinet.  14 Refs.

Title: Perceptual color on internet browser
Abstract: In order to find desired pictures by color keywords on the Internet,  it is necessary to extract color information from picture database  considering perceptual color.  However, there are different viewing  conditions such as monitor difference, different viewing distance  and so on.  This means that a color extraction robot or a retrieval  engine must have the allowance of color ambiguity considering  perceptual color under different viewing conditions, when they are  realized.  For the purpose of clearing the relationship between  perceptual colors under different viewing conditions and controlled  conditions, we modify the collaborative picture evaluation system.   Experiments was opened to the students in our university through the Internet, and continued for 2 weeks to get 16 voluntary testers.   According to experimental result using 50 fruits or vegetable  pictures and 40 color representations, it is found that three  objective colors (red, orange, brown) disagree with the perceptual  colors.  4 Refs.

Title: Plenary talk: Hidden in Greek manuscripts
Abstract: We present two different examples of hidden information in Ancient  Greek and Byzantine manuscripts.  The first is concerned with  Byzantine palimpsests, which are reused parchments.  The under script of such palimpsests is often much more important than the upper  script.  We present three new methods of reading, identifying, and  studying such under scripts (texts), which are sometimes unknown.   The second is concerned with watermarks in Ancient Green and  Byzantine manuscripts.  In this context, watermarks are not used for  the protection of media, but as the medieval paper makers' means of  indicating the manufacturer and the quality of a specific paper.  The design of these watermarks draws from reflections of daily life and  symbols of religious life.  Watermarks often permit today's  codicological scholars to date paper manuscripts with a precision of half a decade.

Title: A PCA approach for fast retrieval of structural patterns in  attributed graphs
Abstract: Attributed graph (AG) is a useful data structure for representing  complex patterns in a wide range of applications such as computer  vision, image database retrieval, and other knowledge representation tasks where similar or exact corresponding structural patterns must  be found.  Existing methods for attributed graph matching (AGM) often suffer from the combinatorial problem whereby the execution cost for finding an exact or similar match is exponentially related to the  number of nodes the AG contains.  In this paper, the square matching  error of two AGs subject to permutations is approximately relaxed to a square matching error of two AGs subject to orthogonal  transformations.  Hence, the principal component analysis (PCA)  algorithm can be used for the fast computation of the approximate  matching error, with a considerably reduced execution complexity.   Experiments demonstrate that this method works well and is robust  against noise and other simple types of transformations.  14 Refs.

Title: Cross-Language Information Retrieval via dictionary-based and  statistics-based methods
Abstract: As Internet resources become accessible to more and more countries,  there is a need to develop methods for Cross Language Information  Retrieval for different languages.  In this paper, we focus on  dictionary-based approach by using a bilingual dictionary, with a  combination to statistics-based methods to avoid the problem of  ambiguity.  Interactive feedback loops are integrated, in the task of query expansion before and after the disambiguation of the  translated candidates.  In this study, we propose three sorts of  query expansions to improve the effectiveness of information  retrieval and to dramatically reduce the errors such an approach  normally makes: an Interactive Relevance Feedback, a Domain Feedback and a Similarity Thesaurus.  We applied these methods to an  English-French Cross-Language Information Retrieval.  In terms of  average precision, a 91.95% and 99.13% of the monolingual  counterpart was achieved for different combinations.  5 Refs.

Title: LIFT: An index structure for high dimensional data
Abstract: A new method for indexing large amounts of points in high-dimensional space is proposed.  The basic principle is as follows: uniformly  partitioning the data space by lattice vector quantization, storing  the lattice points by inverted file, organizing the inverted file by Trie tree, and fast accessing the inverted file by Trie parallel  search algorithm.  We call this index structure LIFT.  Compared with  the traditional index methods, the LIFT can build the index  structure with low complexity, support very high dimensionality, and take advantage of sparsity of data points in high-dimensional space, etc. The experiments show that for high-dimensional data, the LIFT  outperforms the well-known R-tree.

Title: Web-based electronic product cataloging
Abstract: Web-based electronic product cataloging (EPC/Web) refers to the use  of information technology (IT) such as database, multimedia and  Internet in compiling and providing product catalogs by  manufacturers and using and selecting products by customers.  The  resulting electronic product catalogs can be accessed through web  browsers on the Internet/intranet.  Paper-based product catalogs are  used manually and have limitations such as being difficult to update and tedious to search.  When they are replaced electronically, these  shortcomings are overcome and extra features are also provided to  aid the process of archiving and selecting product information.  This paper reports on an effort made to prototype an easy-to-use  web-based EPC system with sufficient cataloging functionally.  The  method of experience gained and lesson learn in developing this  prototype system are discussed.  17 Refs.

Abstract: This paper presents a scaleable and extendable architecture  consisting of the essential building blocks for multimedia  information services.  It provides building blocks for multimedia  transport, storage, retrieval, filtering, and presentation, together with their interdependencies.  After presenting the overall  architecture, we focus in more detail on the 3-level modeling and  querying of multimedia data.  Emphasis is placed on the support for a wide variety of modeling and querying techniques in the context of a coherent architecture.  The description of the architecture is  followed by a description of a possible implementation of the  architecture focussing on specific modeling and querying techniques.  Finally, the use of the architectural components in a number of  example multimedia information retrieval services is shown.  26 Refs.

Title: Server-based smoothing of variable bit-rate streams
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that uses buffer space available at the  server for smoothing disk transfer of variable bit-rate streams.   Previous smoothing techniques prefetched stream data into the clinet buffer space, instead.  However, emergence of personal computing  devices with widely different hardware configurations means that we  should not always assume abundance of resources at the client side.   The new algorithm is shown to have optimal smoothing effect under  the specified constraints.  We incorporate it into a prototype  server, and demonstrate significant increase in the number of  streams concurrently supported at different system scales.  We also  extend our algorithm for striping variable bit-rate streams on  heterogeneous disks.  High bandwidth utilization is achieved across  all the different disks, which leads to server throughput improved  by several factors at high loads.  32 Refs.

Title: A study of smoothing methods for language models applied to ad hoc  information retrieval
Abstract: Language modelling approaches to information retrieval are attractive and promising because they connect the problem of retrieval with  that of language model estimation, which has been studied  extensively in other application areas such as speech recognition.   The basic idea of these approaches is to estimate a language model  for each document, and then rank documents by the likelihood of the  query according to the estimated language model.  A core problem in  language model estimation is smoothing, which adjusts the maximum  likelihood estimator so as to correct the inaccuracy due to data  sparseness.  In this paper, we study the problem of language model  smoothing and its influence on retrieval performance.  We examine the sensitivity of retrieval performance to the smoothing parameters and compare several popular smoothing methods on different test  collections.  22 Refs.

Title: Sensor scheduling in continuous time
Abstract: Let N be the number of available sensor sources.  Noisy observations  of an underlying state process are available for these N sources.  We consider the continuous time sensor scheduling problem in which N//1 of these N sources are to be chosen to collect data at each time  point.  This sensor scheduling problem (with switching costs and  switching constraints) is formulated as a constrained optimal  control problem.  In this framework, the controls represent the  sensors that are chosen at a particular time.  Thus, the control  variables are constrained to take values in a discrete set, and  switchings between sensors can occur in continuous time.  By  incorporating recent results on discrete valued optimal control, we  show that this problem can be transformed into an equivalent  continuous optimal control problem.  In this way, we obtain the  sensor scheduling policy as well as the associated switching times.   copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  8 Refs.

Title: Searcher performance in question answering
Abstract: There are many tasks that require information finding.  Some can be  largely automated, and others greatly benefit from successful  interaction between system and searcher.  We are interested in the  task of answering questions where some synthesis of information is  required-the answer would not generally be given from a single  passage of a single document.  We investigate whether variation in  the way a list of documents is delivered affected searcher  performance in the question answering task.  We will show that there  is a significant difference in performance using a list customized  to the task type, compared with a standard web-engine list.  This  indicates that paying attention to the task and the searcher  interaction may provide substantial improvement in task performance.  19 Refs.

Title: Finding topic words for hierarchical summarization
Abstract: Hierarchies have long been used for organization, summarization, and  access to information.  In this paper we define summarization in  terms of a probabilistic language model and use the definition to  explore a new technique for automatically generating topic  hierarchies by applying a graph-theoretic algorithm, which is an  approximation of the Dominating Set Problem.  The algorithm  efficiently chooses terms according to a language model.  We compare  the new technique to previous methods proposed for constructing  topic hierarchies including subsumption and lexical hierarchies, as  well as the top TF.IDF terms.  Our results show that the new  technique consistently performs as well as or better than these  other techniques.  They also show the usefulness of hierarchies  compared with a list of terms.  19 Refs.

Title: Models for metasearch
Abstract: Given the ranked lists of documents returned by multiple search  engines in response to a given query, the problem of metasearch is  to combine these lists in a way which optimizes the performance of  the combination.  This paper makes three contributions to the problem of metasearch: (1) We describe and investigate a metasearch model  based on an optimal democratic voting procedure, the Borda Count;  (2) we describe and investigate a metasearch model based on Bayesian inference; and (3) we describe and investigate a model for obtaining upper bounds on the performance of metasearch algorithms.  Our  experimental results show that metasearch algorithms based on the  Borda and Bayesian models usually outperform the best input system  and are competitive with, and often outperform, existing metasearch  strategies.  Finally, our initial upper bounds demonstrate that there is much to learn about the limits of the performance of metasearch.   33 Refs.

Title: Automatic generation of concise summaries of spoken dialogues in  unrestricted domains
Abstract: Automatic summarization of open domain spoken dialogues is a new  research area.  This paper introduces the task, the challenges  involved, and presents an approach to obtain automatic extract  summaries for multi-party dialogues of four different genres,  without any restriction on domain.  We address the following issues  which are intrinsic to spoken dialogue summarization and typically  can be ignored when summarizing written text such as newswire data:  (i) detection and removal of speech disfluencies; (ii) detection and insertion of sentence boundaries; (iii) detection and linking of  cross-speaker information units (question-answer pairs).  A global  system evaluation using a corpus of 23 relevance annotated dialogues containing 80 topical segments shows that for the two more informal  genres, our summarization system using dialogue specific components  significantly out-performs a baseline using TFIDF term weighting  with maximum marginal relevance ranking (MMR).  34 Refs.

Title: Generic summaries for indexing in information retrieval
Abstract: This paper examines the use of generic summaries for indexing in  information retrieval.  Our main observations are that: (1) With or  without pseudo-relevance feedback, a summary index may be as  effective as the corresponding fulltext index for precision-oriented search of highly relevant documents.  But a reasonably sophisticated  summarizer, using a compression ratio of 10-30%, is desirable for  this purpose.  (2) In pseudo-relevance feedback, using a summary  index at initial search and a fulltext index at final search is  possibly effective for precision-oriented search, regardless of  relevance levels.  This strategy is significantly more effective than the one using the summary index only and probably more effective  than using summaries as mere term selection filters.  For this  strategy, the summary quality is probably not a critical factor, and a compression ratio of 5-10% appears best.  28 Refs.

Title: Relevance-based language models
Abstract: We explore the relation between classical probabilistic models of  information retrieval and the emerging language modelling  approaches.  It has long been recognized that the primary obstacle to effective performance of classical models is the need to estimate a  relevance model: probabilities of words in the relevant class.  We  propose a novel technique for estimating these probabilities using  the query alone.  We demonstrate that our technique can produce  highly accurate relevance models, addressing important notions of  synonymy and polysemy.  Our experiments show relevance models  outperforming baseline language modelling systems on TREC retrieval  and TDT tracking tasks.  The main contribution of this work is an  effective formal method for estimating a relevance model with no  training data.  26 Refs.

Title: Improving query translation for cross-language information retrieval  using statistical models
Abstract: Dictionaries have often been used for query translation in  cross-language information retrieval (CLIR).  However, we are faced  with the problem of translation ambiguity, i.e. multiple  translations are stored in a dictionary for a word.  In addition, a  word-by-word query translation is not precise enough.  In this paper, we explore several methods to improve the previous dictionary-based  query translation.  First, as many as possible, noun phrases are  recognized and translated as a whole by using statistical models and phrase translation patterns.  Second, the best word translations are  selected based on the cohesion of the translation words.  Our  experimental results on TREC English-Chinese CLIR collection show  that these techniques result in significant improvements over the  simple dictionary approaches, and achieve even better performance  than a high-quality machine translation system.  22 Refs.

Title: Improving cross language information retrieval with triangulated  translation
Abstract: Most approaches to cross language information retrieval assume that  resources providing a direct translation between the query and  document languages exist.  This paper presents research examining the situation where such an assumption is false.  Here, an intermediate  (or pivot) language provides a means of transitive translation of  the query language to that of the document via the pivot, at the  cost, however, of introducing much error.  The paper reports the  novel approach of translating in parallel across multiple  intermediate languages and fusing the results.  Such a technique  removes the error, raising the effectiveness of the tested retrieval system, up to and possibly above the level expected, had a direct  translation route existed.  Across a number of retrieval situations  and combinations of languages, the approach proves to be highly  effective.  20 Refs.

Title: Meta-scoring: Automatically evaluating term weighting schemes in IR  without precision-recall
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method that can automatically evaluate  performance of different term weighting schemes in information  retrieval without resorting to precision-recall based on human  relevance judgments.  Specifically, the problem is: given two  document-term matrixes generated from two different term weighting  schemes, can we tell which term weighting scheme will performance  better than the other? We propose a meta-scoring function, which  takes as input the document-term matrix generated by some term  weighting scheme and computes a "goodness" score from the  document-term matrix.  In our experiments, we found out that this  score is highly correlated with the precision-recall measurement for all the collections and term weighting schema we tried.  Thus, we  conclude that our meta-scoring function can be a substitute for the  precision-recall measurement that needs relevance judgments of human subject.  Furthermore, this meta-scoring function is not limited only to text information retrieval can be applied to fields such as image and DNA retrieval.  11 Refs.

Title: A new approach to unsupervised text summarization
Abstract: The paper presents a novel approach to unsupervised text  summarization.  The novelty lies in exploiting the diversity of  concepts in text for summarization, which has not received much  attention in the summarization literature.  A diversity-based  approach here is a principled generalization of Maximal Marginal  Relevance criterion by Carbonell and Goldstein.  We propose, in  addition, an information-centric approach to evaluation, where the  quality of summaries is judged not in terms of how well they match  human-created summaries but in terms of how well they represent  their source documents in IR tasks such document retrieval and text  categorization.  To find the effectiveness of our approach under the  proposed evaluation scheme, we set out to examine how a system with  the diversity functionality performs against one without, using the  BMIR-J2 corpus, a test data developed by a Japanese research  consortium.  The results demonstrate a clear superiority of a  diversity based approach to a non-diversity based approach.  23 Refs.

Title: A method for selection of appropriate band combinations (centre  wavelength and band width) in thermal infrared region for sea  surface temperature SST retrievals
Abstract: A method for selection of appropriate band (centre wavelength and  bandwidth) combinations for improvement of Sea Surface Temperature  (SST) estimation accuracy is proposed.  It is found that the proposed method for selection of appropriate band combinations for maximizing SST estimation accuracy using the radiative transfer code, MODTRAN  3.7 in this case, is useful to investigate the most appropriate SST  retrieval algorithm as well as choosing an additional band to the  existing band combinations.  In a comparison between the band  combination of the existing NOAA/AVHRR and the results from this  study, it is found that 7 to 11% of improvement on SST estimation  accuracy can be achieved for the proposed band combinations.  Also it is found that 12 [mum] band would be better to shift to the longer wavelength.  Meanwhile, the centre wavelength  of 3.7 [mum] band would be better to shift  to the longer wavelength.  20 Refs.

Title: Random forests
Abstract: Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each  tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently  and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest.  The  generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the  number of trees in the forest becomes large.  The generalization  error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them.   Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y.  Freund & R. Schapire,  Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International  conference, * * *, 148-156), but are more robust with respect to  noise.  Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation  and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of  features used in the splitting.  Internal estimates are also used to  measure variable importance.  These ideas are also applicable to  regression.  17 Refs.

Title: A tradeoff between search and update in dictionaries
Abstract: Borodin, Fich, Meyer auf der Heide, Upfal and Wigderson [ Theoret.  Comput.  Sci.  58 (1998) 57-68] showed lower  bounds for search time in implicit dictionaries with bounded update  time.  In particular, their result implies a lower bound of  Omega(n**epsilon) for search time in an implicit dictionary whenever the update time is bounded by a constant.  They ask whether a similar result is true for dictionaries with explicit pointers.  We answer  their question in the affirmative by observing that stronger results follow easily from an earlier result of Borodin, Guibas, Lynch and  Yao [Inform.  Process.  Lett.  12 (1981) 71-75 right  bracket .  In particular, a lower bound of Omega(n) for search time  holds whenever the update time is bounded by a constant.  Our results hold even if the dictionary uses randomization and the update time  is amortized. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  9 Refs.

Title: Building virtual web views
Abstract: We are so used to the ubiquitous World-Wide Web (WWW) that we take it for granted.  There is no need to emphasize how dynamic, large, rich, and unstructured, yet important the web is.  From researchers and  engineers to children and retired elderly, everyone uses the WWW for a variety of needs.  A multitude of tools and search engines were  developed to find and retrieve resources from the web.  However,  everyone knows how frustrating the experience with search engines  can be.  It is very difficult to find, if ever found, relevant  information or patterns from within resources on the Internet.  The  idea presented in this paper is to "warehouse" the web in a  structure that would allow efficient information retrieval and  knowledge discovery from the Internet.  Warehousing the web in this  context consists of creating different virtual web views with  layered databases of descriptors organized hierarchicly.  Using a  declarative adhoc mining language, one can find and pinpoint  explicit as well as implicit knowledge from the web warehouse. copy  2001 Elsevier science B.V.  All rights reserved.  42 Refs.

Title: A novel scheme using the information of departure processes for delay guarantees of distributed VBR traffic
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of providing delay guarantees  in a distributed environment, e.g., a wireless network or a cable  network.  In a distributed environment, the information of the  arrival process is, in general, not available to the network.  Due to the lack of such information, traffic regulators and scheduling  policies discussed in the literature cannot be directly applied.  To  cope with the problem, we propose a distributed traffic regulator  (DTR) that uses the information of the departure process.  Based on  such DTRs, we propose the distributed earliest deadline first (DEDF) scheduling policy.  For the DEDF scheme, we derive an  admission-control criterion and show that the maximum delay can be  guaranteed if the criterion is satisfied.  25 Refs.

Title: A trial for data retrieval using conceptual fuzzy sets
Abstract: We describe trial applications of fuzzy sets to data retrieval.  The  objectives are to test their ability to achieve conceptual matching  between retrieved objects and the user's intention and to connect  real data with symbolic notations.  The proposed algorithm retrieves  data that conceptually fit the meanings of the entered keyword.  An  algorithm is described that uses fuzzy sets to handle word ambiguity (the main cause of vagueness in the meaning of a word).  It is based  on conceptual fuzzy sets (CFSs), which represent the meaning of  words by chaining other related words.  Two trial applications of  this algorithm to data retrieval are described.  First, an  application to image retrieval shows variation of data retrieval  with conceptual matching and transformation of numeric values into  symbols.  Second, an application to the agent recommending a TV  program shows the method that lets CFSs fit to the sense of a user  by Hebbian learning.  17 Refs.

Title: Web-based procedure to speed-up reaction to in-line inspection alarms
Abstract: An important point in the in-line yield improvement strategy is to be able to react as soon as possible to the alarms detected, and stop  the excursions quickly in order to reduce the impact in yield loss  and reliability.  Therefore, to improve these requirements, we have  developed a procedure, using web-based tools, which we detail in  this paper.  This exchange of information system permits the  operators to easily access the engineer's documents.  The engineering expertise about the usual problems is concentrated in these  documents, which clearly explains the procedures to follow.  Using a  web interface, operators can complete all necessary data to continue with the investigation through different shifts.  This database is  easily accessible by engineers and other operators and the  information is structured and organized in a uniform and correct  way.  In this paper we will show the benefits that we have found  during the last six months working in production with this  procedure.  7 Refs.

Title: SD3: A trust management system with certified evaluation
Abstract: We introduce SD3, a trust management system consisting of a  high-level policy language, a local policy evaluator, and a  certificate retrieval system.  A unique feature of SD3 is its  certified evaluator: as the evaluator computes the answer to a  query, it also computes a proof that the answer follows from the  security policy.  Before the answer is returned, the proof is passed  through a simple checker, and incorrect proofs are reported as  errors.  The certified evaluator reduces the trusted computing base  and greatly increases our confidence that the answers produced by  the evaluator follow from the specification, despite complex  optimizations.  To illustrate SD3's capabilities, we show how to  implement a secure name service, similar to DNSSEC, entirely in SD3.  25 Refs.

Title: Timed mobile agent planning for distributed information retrieval
Abstract: The most significant performance factors in Mobile Agent Planning  (MAP) are; (a) the number of mobile agents, (b) the total routing  time consumed by the participated agents, and (c) the time  constraints, (such as information ready time and deadline triggered  unto each nodes to be visited).  We propose the Timed Mobile Agent  Planning (TMAP), a time constrained mobile agent planning method for finding the minimal number of agents and the best scheduled agents'  itineraries for information retrieval from a distributed computing  environment processed under the time-constraints while keeping the  completion and the total routing time minimal.  Experimental results  show that this method is required and highly applicable directly to  the time-constrained distributed information retrieval environment  which has a time window which consists of a "ready-line"  (information ready time) and a "deadline" (the end of the  information's lifetime).  7 Refs.

Title: Suitable domains for using ordered attribute trees to impute missing  values
Abstract: Using decision trees to fill the missing values in data has been  shown experimentally to be useful in some domains.  However, this is  not the general case.  In other domains, using decision trees for  imputing missing attribute values does not outperform other methods.  Trying to identify the reasons behind the success or failure of the  various methods for filling missing values on different domains can  be useful for deciding the technique to be used when learning  concepts from a new domain with missing values.  This paper presents  a technique by which to approach to previous goal and presents the  results of applying the technique on predicting the success or  failure of a method that uses decision trees to fill the missing  values in an ordered manner.  Results are encouraging because the  obtained decision tree is simple and it can even provide hints for  further improvement on the use of decision trees to impute missing  attribute values.

Title: Scene-centric identification and retrieval of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) video segments
Abstract: With the acceptance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as a primary  platform within the Department of Defense (DOD) for gathering  intelligence data, the amount of video information being recorded,  analyzed, and archived continues to grow.  Mechanisms for quickly  locating and retrieving video segments of interest amongst the many  hours of recorded video are required to accommodate the rapid  turnaround expected in today's wartime planning environments.  This  paper demonstrates that attributes extracted or calculated from  existing mission-related data (specifically telemetry and target  data) can be indexed to support random access into archived video  streams.  These indexes allow video segments to be retrieved based on image characteristics and basic content thus supporting the search  for clear, highly detailed images of targets and areas of interest.

Title: Analysis of image queries in the field of art history
Abstract: This study investigates end-users' image queries by comparing the  features of the queries to those identified in previous studies by  Enser and McGregor (1992), Jorgensen (1995), and Fidel (1997).   Twenty-nine college students majoring in art history were recruited.  They were required to finish a term paper including at least 20  images.  The participants' image queries were collected by pre-and  postsearch questionnaires, and three human reviewers mapped these  queries into the previously identified features.  Enser and  McGregor's categories of Unique and Nonunique, and Jorgensen's  classes of Location, Literal Object, Art Historical Information,  People, and People-Related Attributes received high degrees of  matching by three reviewers.  This finding can be applied to add more details to Enser and McGregor's four categories (Unique, Nonunique,  Unique with refiners, and Nonunique with refiners) and to regroup  Jorgensen's 12 classes of image attributes.

Title: Symbolic debugging scheme for optimized hardware and software
Abstract: Symbolic debuggers are system development tools that can accelerate  the validation speed of behavioral specifications by allowing a user to interact with an executing code at the source level.  In response  to a user query, the debugger retrieves the value of a source  variable in a manner consistent with respect to the source statement where execution has halted.  However, when a behavioral specification has been optimized using transformations, values of variables may be inaccessible in the run-time state.  We have developed a set of  techniques that, given a behavioral specification CDFG, enforce  computation of a selected subset V//c//u//t of user variables such  that (i) all other variables v qq CDFG can be computed from  V//c//u//t and (ii) this enforcement has minimal impact on the  optimization potential of the computation.  The implementation of the new debugging approach poses several optimization tasks.  We have  formulated the optimization tasks and developed heuristics to solve  them.  The effectiveness of the approach has been demonstrated on a  set of benchmark designs.  (Author abstract) 13 Refs.

Title: Retrieval of commercials by semantic content: The semiotic  perspective
Abstract: Video information processing and retrieval is a key aspect of future  multimedia technologies and applications.  Commercial videos encode  several planes of expression through a rich and dense use of colors, editing effects, viewpoints and rhythms, which are exploited  together to attract potential purchasers.  Databases of commercials  can be accessed in order to analyze how a commercial has been  developed, retrieve commercials similar to an example, catalog  commercials according to the kind of message conveyed to the user.   In this paper, we present a system allowing the retrieval of  commercial streams based on their salient semantics.  Semantics is  regarded from the semiotics perspective: collections of signs and  semantic features like colors, editing effects, motion, etc. are  used as basic blocks with which the meaning of a commercial is  constructed.  In our system, it is possible to retrieve commercials  according to both the meaning they convey and to their similarity to examples.  (Author abstract) 22 Refs.

Title: Unsupervised learning by probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis
Abstract: This paper presents a novel statistical method for factor analysis of binary and count data which is closely related to a technique known  as Latent Semantic Analysis.  In contrast to the latter method which  stems from linear algebra and performs a Singular Value  Decomposition of co-occurrence tables, the proposed technique uses a generative latent class model to perform a probabilistic mixture  decomposition.  This results in a more principled approach with a  solid foundation in statistical inference.  More precisely, we  propose to make use of a temperature controlled version of the  Expectation Maximization algorithm for model fitting, which has  shown excellent performance in practice.  Probabilistic Latent  Semantic Analysis has many applications, most prominently in  information retrieval, natural language processing, machine learning from text, and in related areas.  The paper presents perplexity  results for different types of text and linguistic data collections  and discusses an application in automated document indexing.  The  experiments indicate substantial and consistent improvements of the  probabilistic method over standard Latent Semantic Analysis.  (Author abstract) 24 Refs.

Title: Data compression through adaptive Huffman coding scheme
Abstract: A number of data compression techniques have been introduced to  reduce the text/data storage and transmission costs.  This paper  describes the development of a data compression system that employs  adaptive Huffman method for generating variable-length codes.   Construction of the tree is discussed for gathering latest  information about the entered message.  The encoder process of the  system encodes frequently occurring characters with shorter bit  codes and infrequently appearing characters with longer bit codes.   Adaptive, sibling, swapping, escape code, and re-scaling mechanisms  of the model are briefly explained as they are extremely useful in  enhancing compression efficiency.  The decoder process expands the  encoded text back to the original text and works very much like the  encoder process.  Experimental results are tabulated which  demonstrate that the developed system is very effective for  compressing database files (provides compression ratio up to 52.51%) in a real-time environment.

Title: Speaker indexing in large audio databases using anchor models
Abstract: This paper introduces the technique of anchor modeling in the  applications of speaker detection and speaker indexing.  The anchor  modeling algorithm is refined by pruning the number of models  needed.  The system is applied to the speaker detection problem where its performance is shown to fall short of the state-of-the-art  Gaussian Mixture Model with Universal Background Model (GMM-UBM)  system.  However, it is further shown that its computational  efficiency lends itself to speaker indexing for searching large  audio databases for desired speakers.  Here, excessive computation  may prohibit the use of the GMM-UBM recognition system.  Finally, the paper presents a method for cascading anchor model and GMM-UBM  detectors for speaker indexing.  This approach benefits from the  efficiency of anchor modeling and high accuracy of GMM-UBM  recognition.  7 Refs.

Title: Automating component integration for web-based data analysis
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a component-based infrastructure for  Web-based data analysis applications that reduces the need for  custom integration programming.  Our vision is that, to construct an  application, scientists will give a specification of three kinds of  components: the desired data source, a data analysis filter, and a  visualization device.  From this specification, our infrastructure  will automatically generate the desired application.  To support this vision, the infrastructure contains an intelligent component  integration system (iCIS) that automates component retrieval,  adaptation, and integration.  Within iCIS, component knowledge is  represented using formal mathematical specifications, to provide a  common framework for reasoning about problem decomposition,  component retrieval and adapter generation.  Our current focus is on  integration of data analysis filters with online data archives  described using XML-based languages.  We also discuss how iCIS is  integrated with a 3-tier client/server application architecture to  support in a heterogeneous and distributed computing environment.  29 Refs.

Title: The iterated Prisoner's Dilemma: Early experiences with learning  classifier system-based simple agents
Abstract: Prior research on artificial agents/agencies involves entities using  specifically tailored operational strategies (e.g., for information  retrieval, purchase negotiation).  In some situations, however, an  agent must interact with others whose strategies are initially  unknown and whose interests may counter its own.  In such  circumstances, pre-defining effective counter-strategies could  become difficult or impractical.  One solution, which may be viable  in certain contexts, is to create agents that self-evolve  increasingly effective strategies from rudimentary beginnings,  during actual deployment.  Using the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma  (IPD) problem as a generic agent-interaction setting, we use the  Learning Classifier System (LCS) paradigm to construct autonomously  adapting "simple" agents.  A simple agent attempts to cope by  maintaining an evolving but potentially perennially incomplete and  imperfect knowledge base.  These agents operate against specifically  tailored (non-adaptive) agents.  We present a preliminary suite of  simulation experiments and results.  The promise evidenced leads us  to articulate several additional areas of interesting investigations that we are pursuing. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights  reserved.  16 Refs.

Title: A GA-based dynamic personalized filtering for Internet search service on multi-serach engine
Abstract: This paper proposed a methodology based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) to  provide a novel way for searching via the Internet with multi-search engine.  The proposed system provides a WWW interface for users to  enter the keyword.  The system connects to the Octopus to get all  links and contents.  According to the user profile, the system  dynamically trains the weights of each keyword by GA, and sorts all  the links to adopt 10 best-fit to the user.  When the user had  browsed the first viewing page and gave the system some feedbacks,  the system than utilizes the user's feedbacks to re-train the  weights of each remaining keywords.  After the training, it uses the  new weight combination for the keywords set to determine the order  of the remaining links to prepare the next viewing page, and so on.   The experiments show that it is suitable for those people that want  to collect the comprehensive information via the Internet.  15 Refs.

Title: Preserving the facts for the future: Principles and practices for the transfer of analog audio documents into the digital domain
Abstract: The world's stock of audio recordings is estimated to be more than 50 Mh (million hours) of materials.  The greater part of these  recordings is analog, and many are unique documents of cultural,  scientific, or artistical value.  None of these recordings are on  permanent carriers; therefore sooner or later a transfer into the  digital domain will be necessary.  The technical, ethical, and  strategic aspects of such a task are described.  Aside of its primary aim of safeguarding a considerable part of our cultural heritage, it is the job-creative aspect that makes the future of sound archives  so challenging.  13 Refs.

Title: Compensation methods to support cooperative applications: A case  study in automated verification of schema requirements for an  advanced transaction model
Abstract: Compensation plays an important role in advanced transaction models,  cooperative work and workflow systems.  A schema designer is  typically required to supply for each transaction T another  transaction T**-**1 to semantically undo the effects of T. Little  attention has been paid to the verification of the desirable  properties of such operations, however.  This paper demonstrates the  use of a higher-order logic theorem prover for verifying that  compensating transactions return a database to its original state.   It is shown how an OODB schema is translated to the language of the  theorem prover so that proofs can be performed on the compensating  transactions.  40 Refs.

Title: A temporal object-oriented model for digital libraries of documents
Abstract: This paper presents a model for the representation and retrieval of  structured documents considering their temporal properties.  The  purpose of this model is to serve as a platform for the development  of digital library applications.  Thus, it consists of both a new  data model and a query language that are specially adapted to the  requirements of these applications.  The main elements of the data  model are a flexible type system for structured documents, and two  temporal dimensions that represent the temporal properties of  documents and the evolution of the database schema.  As for its query language, it allows the retrieval of documents by specifying  conditions on their structure, contents and temporal properties.   This query language has been designed for exploiting the temporal  information stored into a large digital library, making possible to  relate document contents in time, as well as to analyse the  evolution of topics.  The paper also includes some guidelines for the efficient implementation of databases of structured documents by  adopting the proposed data and query models.  31 Refs.

Title: Consistency management in object-oriented databases
Abstract: The paper presents concepts and ideas underlying an approach for  consistency management in object-oriented (OO) databases.  In this  approach constraints are considered as first class citizens and  stored in a meta-database called constraints catalog.  When an object is created constraints of this object are retrieved from the  constraints catalog and relationships between these constraints and  the object are established.  The structure of constraints has several features that enhance consistency management in OO database  management systems which do not exist in conventional approaches in  a satisfactory way.  This includes: monitoring object consistency at  different levels of update granularity, integrity independence, and  efficiency of constraints maintenance; controlling inconsistent  objects; enabling and disabling constraints, globally to all objects or locally to individual objects; and declaring constraints on  individual objects.  All these features are provided by means of  basic notations of OO data models.  59 Refs.

Title: Information retrieval in digital watermarking
Abstract: Digital watermarking, the art of robust information hiding in images, has gained a large interest in both research and industry in the  past few years.  Every watermarking system has two main parts:  watermark embedding and watermark extraction/detection.  Recent  developments in the theoretical analysis of digital watermarking  schemes have shown that there is a direct link between digital  watermarking and communication theory.  These parallels are extremely helpful when it comes to designing efficient and optimal watermark  detectors.  In this article we will focus on this issue and  investigate how to design good watermark detectors taking into  account the basics of communication theory.  Furthermore, we will  talk about different ways to achieve robustness to geometrical  attacks and elaborate on watermark attacks.  5 Refs.

Title: Mapping XML documents to the object-relational form
Abstract: In e-commerce, partners doing business need to exchange many forms of documents as a means of communication between them through the  Internet, such as product catalogs, purchase orders, invoices and so on.  XML, which is a new standard adopted by World Wide Web  Consortium to complement HTML for data exchange on the Web, has been used as a language for describing those documents used in e-commerce such as in xCBL.  For XML to be used effectively in e-commerce, we  need a system to store XML data, retrieve the data if a request is  given, create a required document based on the data, and send the  created document to the partners.  In this paper, we are concerned  with storing XML data.  We will suggest a method to store XML  documents in the object-relational form as an alternative to get  advantages from the two approaches of object-oriented and relational table forms.  We will then implement it on the Oracle 8i database  [5] .  7 Refs.

Title: A media agent for automatically building a personalized semantic  index of Web media objects
Abstract: A novel idea of media agent is briefly presented, which can  automatically build a personalized semantic index of Web media  objects for each particular user.  Because the Web is a rich source  of multimedia data and the text content on the Web pages is usually  semantically related to those media objects on the same pages, the  media agent can automatically collect the URLs and related text, and then build the index of the multimedia data, on behalf of the user  whenever and wherever she accesses these multimedia data or their  container Web pages.  Moreover, the media agent can also use an  off-line crawler to build the index for those multimedia objects  that are relevant to the user's favorites but have not accessed by  the user yet.  When the user wants to find these multimedia data once again, the semantic index facilitates text-based search for her.  5  Refs.

Furthermore, we have developed an exhaustive statistical  analysis of searches, categories visited and documents viewed to  achieve a mathematical pattern of behaviour for each one, and what  it is more important, to establish a relationship between the  variations in the behaviour of each one.  7 Refs.

Title: Implementing KDB-trees to support high-dimensional data
Abstract: The problem of retrieving large volumes of high dimensional data is  an important and timely issue in the area of database management.   The guiding idea of this paper is to develop a general-purpose point access method that attacks the limitations of KDB-trees in  high-dimensional spaces, while preserving their relatively good  performance in low-dimensional situations.  The proposed structure,  called high-dimensional KDB-tree, eliminates downward propagation of splits associated with the original KDB-tree structure, which  results in low storage utilization and rapid deterioration of the  retrieval performance.  Additional improvements in the storage and  retrieval performance are achieved by removing certain redundant  information from the interior nodes.  Experimental results show that, in high-dimensional spaces, the proposed structure outperforms the  original KDB-trees by a significant margin, while incurring no loss  of performance in low-dimensional spaces.  The structure also  outperforms two other variants of KDB-trees investigated in the  paper.  21 Refs.

Title: Evolutionary learning of Web-document structure for information  retrieval
Abstract: Web-documents have a number of tags indicating the structure of  documents.  The tag information can be utilized to improve the  performance of document retrieval systems.  In this paper, we propose an approach to retrieve Web-documents using HTML tags and then uses  a genetic algorithm to adapt the tag weights.  This method uses a  modified similarity measure based on the tag weights.  A genetic  learning method is used to select the tags for retrieval and get the optimal tag weights.  We evaluate our method via experiments on  conference pages and TREC document sets.  The experimental results  show that the tag weights are well trained by the proposed algorithm in accordance with the importance factors for retrieval.  The  proposed method has achieved about 10% improvement in retrieval  accuracy.  26 Refs.

In this paper, we propose  Hierarchical Associative system with selective Information retrieval mechanism considering the above functions.  We applied this system to the area for estimating the purchasing degree from the customer's  tastes, the pattern of commodities and evaluation of a company.  14  Refs.

Title: Effective foreign word extraction for Korean information retrieval
Abstract: In Korean text, foreign words, which are mostly transliterations of  English words, are frequently used.  Foreign words are usually very  important index terms in Korean information retrieval since most of  them are technical terms or names.  So accurate foreign word  extraction is crucial for high performance of information retrieval.  However, accurate foreign word extraction is not easy because it  inevitably accompanies word segmentation and most of the foreign  words are unknown.  In this paper, we present an effective foreign  word recognition and extraction method.  In order to accurately  extract foreign words, we developed an effective method of word  segmentation that involves unknown foreign words.  Our word  segmentation method effectively utilizes both unknown word  information acquired through the automatic dictionary compilation  and foreign word recognition information.  Our HMM-based foreign word recognition method does not require large labeled examples for the  model training unlike the previously propose d method. copy 2001  Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: A survey of alternative designs for a search engine storage structure
Abstract: Three information retrieval storage structures are considered to  determine their suitability for a World Wide Web search engine: The  Wolverhampton Web Library - The Next Generation.  The structures are  an inverted file, signature file and Pat tree.  A number of  implementations are considered for each structure.  For the index of  an inverted file a sorted array, B-tree, B+-tree, trie and hash  table are considered.  For the signature file vertical and horizontal partitioning schemes are considered and for the Pat tree a tree and  array implementation are considered.  A theoretical comparison of the structures is done on seven criteria that include: response time,  support for results ranking, search techniques, file maintenance,  efficient use of disk space (including the use of compression),  scalability and extensibility.  The comparison reveals that an  inverted file is the most suitable structure, unlike the signature  file and Pat tree, which encounter problems with very large corpora. copy 2001 Elsevier Scienc e B.V.

Title: Operational decision making and the alignment of information  requirements
Abstract: When providing information to help people make better decisions it is important to consider both the attributes that give data its meaning and the decision process itself.  All of the attributes of meaningful information are linked to the decision process.  Information is often filtered by heuristic's or rules of thumb during to the decision  process.  If data is seen to be irrelevant due to the inappropriate  specification of its attributes the data may be overlooked or the  wrong problem may be solved.  An information audit process was  developed to bring the five attributes of meaningful information and the six phases of decision making together.  The audit process formed part of an APPI minor thesis and was used to structure the  information generated by a supervisory process control system.   Information that is appropriate for the decision being made was  found to drive the decision process and increase the frequency and  quality of the decisions being made.  7 Refs.

Title: Efficient World-Wide-Web information gathering
Abstract: With the information available through World-Wide-Web becoming  overwhelming, efficient information gathering (IG) tools are  necessary.  Since the network resources are expensive, so IG is a  resource-bounded task.  The main purpose of this paper is to find an  efficient gathering method for specific topic.  This paper presents  methods for predicting page's content without downloading it designs different controlling strategies, and defines several kinds of page  downloading priority measures.  An IG system, TH-gatherer, was built  to test the methods, and different experiments were carried out.   Through experiments, it was found that the content of candidate  pages can be predicted approximately without downloading.  When the  priority based gathering strategy and hybrid measure are used, the  gathering efficiency is four times of that of BFS strategy which is  used by many current IG tools (including crawlers and off-line  browsing tools).  The method presented is suitable for  resource-bounded, specific topic information gathering.  7 Refs.

Title: Adaptive control of pre-fetching
Abstract: Redundant arrays of independent disks (RAID) remain the mass storage  medium of choice for real-time processing and information storage  and retrieval.  This paper proposes new adaptive pre-fetching  algorithms for RAID systems using "life-time function analysis of  programs".  The life-time function approach allows us to derive an  inequality which allows us to determine when pre-fetching can be  effective.  This inequality relates the changes in disk transfer  times to the changes in inter-page fault times with the ratio of  disk transfer time to page fault time.  We then use this inequality  to design and adaptive pre-fetching strategies, and to propose a  practical implementation.  Simulation experiments to evaluate the  effectiveness of the proposed approach are carried out.  The  analytical approach based on a single process execution model is  extended to a multiprogramming environment using a queuing network  model, as well as to a simpler approach using a "parallel  processing" approximation. copy 2001 Elsvier Science B.V.

In practice, however, design reuse is  plagued with difficulties, including those associated with the  indexing, retrieval, understanding and modification of prior design  knowledge.  We propose that such difficulties can be ameliorated by  employing insights deriving from design-rationale research  concerning how best to represent and retrieve design information.  We illustrate these insights by describing the development of a  design-reuse system that maximizes the benefits of rationale capture and information retrieval whilst minimising the costs to the  designer that might arise from disruption to natural design work.   copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Meaningful regions extraction based on image analysis
Abstract: To support semantic-based image retrieval, the meaningful regions in  image need to be first extracted.  This paper proposes a new scheme  for roughly extracting meaningful regions from image based on the  results of image analysis, which uses various and suitable  techniques according to the characteristics of images.  The  particularities of this scheme mainly include nonsupervision and  self-adaptation.  On the basis of analyzing the isolation parameters  and coarseness parameters of image clustering, this scheme makes use of either thresholding technique based on hue histogram or  clustering technique with texture and hue density functions or  clustering technique with brightness and hue density functions.   Experiments on extracting meaningful regions from a number of real  images and on providing the basis for further semantic-based image  retrieval show some satisfactory results and the potential on real  applications.  9 Refs.

Title: A neural network approach to magnitude retrieval
Abstract: This paper presents a neural network (NN) approach for constructing  time-domain signals from phases of their discrete Fourier  transforms, to solve the so-called magnitude retrieval problem.  The  solution of the magnitude retrieval problem is not unique in  general.  In this paper, we impose two constraints (non-negativity  and not having conjugate reciprocal z-transform zeros) to obtain a  unique solution by a neural network.  The neural network structure we propose is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with sigmoid function and  back-propagation learning rule.  Using simulation studies, we  illustrate the capability of this NN structure in solving the  magnitude retrieval problem for discrete signals.  The NN approach  presented in this paper is fast, always generates a specific  solution, i.e., the non-negative solution, and is not sensitive to  the observation noise.  A combination of the NN approach and a  classical approach (alternating projections) can eliminate the  deficiencies of both methods. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All  rights reserved.  12 Refs.

Title: Information visualization for intelligent decision support systems
Abstract: To work efficiently with decision support systems (DSS), most users  benefit from representation conversion, i.e. translating the  specific outcome from the DSS, normally portrayed in a numerical  format, into the universal language of the visual.  In general,  interpretation of data is much more intuitive if the results from  the DSS are translated into charts, maps, and other graphical  displays because visualization exploits our natural ability to  recognize and understand visual patterns.  In this paper we discuss  the concept of visualization user interface (VUI) for DSS.  A  proprietary software system known as AniGraftool is introduced as an example of an information visualization application for DSS.  In  addition, a visualized information retrieval engine based on fuzzy  control is proposed. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights  reserved.  10 Refs.

Title: Information retrieval on an SCI-based PC cluster
Abstract: This article presents an efficient parallel information retrieval  (IR) system which provides fast information service for the Internet users on low-cost high-performance PC-NOW environment.  The IR system is implemented on a PC cluster based on the scalable coherent  interface (SCI), a powerful interconnecting mechanism for both  shared memory models and message-passing models.  In the IR system,  the inverted-index file (IIF) is partitioned into pieces using a  greedy declustering algorithm and distributed to the cluster nodes  to be stored on each node's hard disk.  For each incoming user's  query with multiple terms, terms are sent to the corresponding nodes which contain the relevant pieces of the IIF to be evaluated in  parallel.  The IR system is developed using a distributed-shared  memory (DSM) programming technique based on the SCI.  According to  the experiments, the IR system outperforms an MPI-based IR system  using Fast Ethernet as an interconnect.  Speed-up of up to 5.0 was  obtained with an 8-node cluster in processing each query on a  500,000-document IIF.  15 Refs.

Title: Visual system for automatic car registration
Abstract: In car assembly plants, when the car assembly process has finished,  it is necessary to carry out a registration process which certifies  that all the identification labels placed in specific parts of the  vehicle (motor, chassis, board, windshield, right front post, etc.)  correspond with a particular car unit.  In this paper we propose a  system for capturing and processing car identification labels.  The  system captures the required images for the registration process  using a CCD camera with an appropriate mount.  Images are analyzed  and stored by the system, generating a report, where all the  captured visual information is included.  The information is further  stored in a way, that allows the retrieval of each report.  Results  and discussion about the system are presented.  7 Refs.

Title: Discoverylink: A system for integrated access to life sciences data  sources
Abstract: Vast amounts of life sciences data reside today in specialized data  sources, with specialized query processing capabilities.  Data from  one source often must be combined with data from other sources to  give users the information they desire.  There are database  middleware systems that extract data from multiple sources in  response to a single query.  IBM's DiscoveryLink is one such system,  targeted to applications from the life sciences industry.   DiscoveryLink provides users with a virtual database to which they  can pose arbitrarily complex queries, even though the actual data  needed to answer the query may originate from several different  sources, and none of those sources, by itself, is capable of  answering the query.  We describe the DiscoveryLink offering,  focusing on two key elements, the wrapper architecture and the query optimizer, and illustrate how it can be used to integrate the access to life sciences data from heterogeneous data sources.  59 Refs.

Title: Median measure: An approach to IR systems evaluation
Abstract: In this paper results from three studies examining 1295 relevance  judgments by 36 information retrieval (IR) system end-users is  reported.  Both the region of the relevance judgments, from  non-relevant to highly relevant, and the motivations or levels for  the relevance judgments are examined.  Three major findings are  studied.  First, the frequency distributions of relevance judgments  by IR system end-users tend to take on a bi-modal shape with peaks  at the extremes (non-relevant/relevant) with a flatter middle range.  Second, the different type of scale (interval or ordinal) used in  each study did not alter the shape of the relevance frequency  distributions.  And third, on an interval scale, the median point of  relevance judgment distributions correlates with the point where  relevant and partially relevant items begin to be retrieved.  The  median point of a distribution of relevance judgments may provide a  measure of user/IR system interaction to supplement precision/recall measures.  The implications of investigation for relevance theory and IR systems evaluation are discussed. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.  40 Refs.

Title: Bibliometric cartography of information retrieval research by using  co-word analysis
Abstract: The aim of this study is to map the intellectual structure of the  field of Information Retrieval (IR) during the period of 1987-1997.   Co-word analysis was employed to reveal patterns and trends in the  IR field by measuring the association strengths of terms  representative of relevant publications or other texts produced in  IR field.  Data were collected from Science Citation Index (SCI) and  Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) for the period of 1987-1997.  In addition to the keywords added by the SCI and SSCI databases, other  important keywords were extracted from titles and abstracts  manually.  These keywords were further standardized using vocabulary  control tools.  In order to trace the dynamic changes of the IR  field, the whole 11-year period was further separated into two  consecutive periods: 1987-1991 and 1992-1997.  The results show that  the IR field has some established research themes and it also  changes rapidly to embrace new themes. copy 2001 Elsevier Science  Ltd.  34 Refs.

Title: Information navigation on the web by clustering and summarizing query results
Abstract: We report our experience with a novel approach to interactive  information seeking that is grounded in the idea of summarizing  query results through automated document clustering.  We went through a complete system development and evaluation cycle: designing the  algorithms and interface for our prototype, implementing them and  testing with human users.  Our prototype acted as an intermediate  layer between the user and a commercial Internet search engine (Alta Vista), thus allowing searches of the significant portion of World  Wide Web.  In our final evaluation, we processed data from 36 users  and concluded that our prototype improved search performance over  using the same search engine (AltaVista) directly.  We also analyzed  effects of various related demographic and task related parameters.   copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.  43 Refs.

Title: A comparative analysis of information acquisition mechanisms for  discrete resource allocation
Abstract: Discrete resource allocation problems (RAPs) are concerned with  making decisions that result in an optimal deployment of indivisible scarce resources among a group of agents so as to achieve the  maximum aggregate utility.  One prerequisite for solving the discrete RAP is that the decision maker be cognizant of the individual  utility functions for the agents involved.  When an agent's  preference information is not available, the decision maker needs to gather such information through an inquiry process.  The information  acquisition process entails its own costs such as communication  costs and computation costs.  In this paper, three different  information inference mechanisms-merging, ranking, and entropy-are  proposed and compared for the information acquisition process in the discrete RAP.  It is found that the merging mechanism results in the  least computation costs for the decision maker while the entropy  mechanism incurs the least communication costs.  41 Refs.

Title: Rough set theory: A data mining tool for semiconductor manufacturing
Abstract: The growing volume of information poses interesting challenges and  calls for tools that discover properties of data.  Data mining has  emerged as a discipline that contributes tools for data analysis,  discovery of new knowledge, and autonomous decision-making.  In this  paper, the basic concepts of rough set theory and other aspects of  data mining are introduced.  The rough set theory offers a viable  approach for extraction of decision rules from data sets.  The  extracted rules can be used for making predictions in the  semiconductor industry and other applications.  This contrasts other  approaches such as regression analysis and neural networks where a  single model is built.  One of the goals of data mining is to extract meaningful knowledge.  The power, generality, accuracy, and longevity of decision rules can be increased by the application of concepts  from systems engineering and evolutionary computation introduced in  this paper.  A new rule-structuring algorithm is proposed.  The  concepts presented in the paper are illustrated with examples.  25  Refs.

Title: Preparing for the future: Aging and alternative and augmentative  communication
Abstract: Despite a large body of literature focusing on how the normal aging  process affects quality of life, little is known about how aging  influences the lives of those who use alternative and augmentative  communication (AAC).  This article explores issues relevant to aging  and AAC, examining the responses of 78 augmented communicators aged  30 years and older who participated in a larger national survey of  270 adults with cerebral palsy.  The survey sought information about  health, modes of communication, and access to information.  The  results indicate that those involved in the AAC field must work with individuals who use augmentative communication to ensure that they  maintain their health, well-being, and effective communication as  they age.  60 Refs.

Title: An exploratory study of electronic mail as a rich communication  medium in a global virtual organization
Abstract: This paper explores how intra-organizational communication in a  global virtual organization was impacted as the dominant  communication mode evolved, from postal messages to facsimile to  electronic mail, over a ten year period.  Drawing on theories of  communication media, we have proposed that changes in organizational communication mode will affect the nature and outcomes of  organizational communication in terms of message frequency, message  length, message cycle time, participation rate, idea generation,  information gathering, social orientation, and decision-making  speed.  To test these propositions, we analyzed a dataset containing  907 written documents (187 regular post, 407 fax, and 312 e-mail),  collected from the archives of a global organization between 1989  and 1999.  Results show support for e-mail as a rich communication  medium compared with other written media, particularly in terms of  increased participation rates, idea generation, socially-oriented  communication, and decision-making speed.

Title: Correlation-based document clustering using web logs
Abstract: A problem facing information retrieval on the web is how to  effectively cluster large amounts of web documents.  One approach is  to cluster the documents based on information provided only by users usage logs and not by the content of the documents.  In this paper,  we present a recursive density based clustering algorithm that can  adaptively change its parameters intelligently.  Our clustering  algorithm RDBC is based on DBSCAN, a density based algorithm that  has been proven in its ability in processing very large datasets.   The fact that DBSCAN does not require the pre-determination of the  number of clusters and is linear in time complexity makes it  particularly attractive in web page clustering.  It can be shown that RDBC require the same time complexity as that of the DBSCAN  algorithm.  In addition, we prove both analytically and  experimentally that our method yields clustering results that are  superior to that of DBSCAN.

Title: Can readers understand their profiles? A study of human involvement  in reader profiling
Abstract: The aim in information filtering is to provide users with a  personalised selection of information, based on a description of  their interest profile.  In some domains, users will want access to  such profiles even if they are system generated.  We have performed a study of the effects of combining automatic profiling with explicit  user involvement.  Firstly, we wanted to explore if a machine-learned profile would benefit from being based on an initial explicit user  profile.  Secondly, we tested if profiles that provided better  filtering also were better liked by users.  Finally, we tested if  users could make improvements to machine-learned profiles.  We found  that the initial setup of a personal profile was effective, and  yielded performance improvements even after feedback training.   However, the study showed no correlation between users ratings of  profiles and their filtering performance, and neither did user  modifications to learned profiles improve filtering performance.

Title: Collective memory support in negotiation: A theoretical framework
Abstract: Negotiation analysis is complex.  It may involve multiple issues of  dispute, rules of negotiation, negotiators' strategies,  interventions by third party, negotiators' cognitions, beliefs,  preferences and attitude towards risks.  Negotiators may have limited attention, limited capacity to store and retrieve memory information and limited capacity to process information.  As a result they rely  on heuristics or schemas and fail to generate optimal outcomes in  negotiation.  An approach to overcome cognitive limitation in  negotiation is to provide additional support to store and retrieve  memory information.  This paper reiterates the conceptual framework  of a computer supported negotiation memory support system (NMSS) and proposes a theoretical model of the influence of NMSS on negotiation outcome.

Title: An empirical comparison of visualization tools to assist information  retrieval on the Web
Abstract: Visualizations of subspaces on the World Wide Web can provide users  the ability to identify relevant information from a set of Web  pages, while gaining new insights or understanding of the space.   This study tested three classes of visualization techniques,  distortion, zoom, and expanding outline, to better understand which  classes of visualization techniques may better represent the  underlying structure.  The effects of different visualization  techniques on user performance on information searching tasks and  the effects of different sizes of the Web spaces were studied.   Eighty participants were asked to search information with and  without a visualization tool over the large Web space.  The factors  that may have caused cognitive overloads are further discussed.  23  Refs.

Title: Visualization of term discrimination analysis
Abstract: A visual term discrimination value analysis method is introduced  using a document density space within a distance-angle-based visual  information retrieval environment.  The term discrimination capacity  is analyzed using the comparison of the distance and angle-based  visual representations with and without a specified term, thereby  allowing the user to see the impact of the term on individual  documents within the density space.  Next, the concept of a "term  density space" is introduced for term discrimination analysis.  Using this concept, a term discrimination capacity for distinguishing one  term from others in the space can also be visualized within the  visual space.  Applications of these methods facilitate more  effective assignment of term weights to index terms within documents and may assist searchers in the selection of search terms.  26 Refs.

Title: XML based security for E-commerce applications
Abstract: The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is widely seen as the successor  to HTML.  XML facilitates Internet B2B messaging owing to its  simplicity and flexibility.  The eXtensible Markup Language's  strength for e-commerce applications will be realized only when its  inherent security weaknesses are identified and dislodged.  XML was  initially introduced as a data format for documents.  Some  applications need to block or allow access to entire XML instances,  while others control access at the tag level.  The control residing  at the tag level is particularly important in the view of wider use  of the XLink and XPointer standards, which enable applications to  retrieve portions of documents.  This paper discusses how security  could be provided by XML documents based on authentication and  encryption techniques using Document type Definition (DTDs) and  digital signatures.  11 Refs.

Title: A nested combinatorial-states model of sentence processing
Abstract: Natural languages differ in the directionality of their syntactic  build-up, developing from the phrasal head or matrix clause in  either a left-branching direction or a right-branching direction.   Japanese, for example, is quite consistently left-branching, while  English is generally right-branching.  We argue that the purported  greater complexity of left-branching sentences arises from a  confusion of analytical syntactic structure with sentence processing mechanisms, and we propose a model based upon the Chalmers'  Combinatorial-State Automaton (CSA) which we suggest more nearly  approximates actual neural processes.  Our model, a Nested  Combinatorial-States Automaton (NCA), can be constrained to require  only finite memory resources, and assumes that the greater part of  sentence processing occurs at the lexical level.  28 Refs.

Title: Fuzzy division in fuzzy relational databases: An approach
Abstract: An approach to calculate the relational division in fuzzy databases  is presented, starting with the GEFRED model.  The tuples of the  division are obtained with a possibility degree that indicates the  extent to which they comply with the relational division requisites.  The results obtained are those expected a priori.  Furthermore, in  order to formalize this method of fuzzy relational division, two new operators are defined which may be useful in other operations: the  qualified fuzzy intersection and the generalized fuzzy projection  with group functions.  Some examples are included in order to clarify the method proposed here and the defined operators.  A comparison  with other fuzzy division approaches that appear in the literature  is included too. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  24 Refs.

Title: An image retrieval model based on fuzzy triples
Abstract: This paper proposes an image retrieval model for indexing and  retrieving images with fuzzy triples.  The well-known triple  framework based on two-dimensional (2D) strings is a novel index  mechanism in that it allows us to simply specify the spatial  structure of images, guaranteeing fast retrieval time.  However,  there are two significant drawbacks in this framework; one is that  it cannot accommodate a concept-based image retrieval and the other  is that it does not deal with an inexact match among directions.  The former is crucial when answers turn out to be relevant only when  they are conceptually related with user queries and the latter is  useful especially when the spatial relationship cannot be specified  in terms of eight directions.  Our model supports the concept-based  image retrieval as well as the inexact match with a fuzzy triple  matching performed when evaluating queries.  To demonstrate the  feasibility of the model, we also develop a prototypal system  directly supporting it. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  17 Refs.

Title: A method of highspeed similarity retrieval based on self-organizing  maps
Abstract: Feature-based similarity retrieval become an important research issue in image database systems.  The features of image data are useful to  discrimination of images.  In this paper, we propose the highspeed  k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm based on Self-Organizing Maps.   Self-Organizing Maps(SOM) provides a mapping from high dimensional  feature vectors onto a two-dimensional space.  The mapping preserves  the topology of the feature vectors.  The map is called topological  feature map.  A topological feature map preserves the mutual  relations (similarity) in feature spaces of input data, and clusters mutually similar feature vectors in a neighboring nodes.  Each node  of the topological feature map holds a node vector and similar  images that is the closest to each node vector.  In topological  feature map, there are empty nodes in which no image is classified.   We experiment on the performance of our algorithm using color  feature vectors extracted from images.  Promising results have been  obtained in experiments.  21 Refs.

Title: Mediacaptain - an interface for browsing streaming media
Abstract: The increase of bandwidth and streaming technology has made video on  the Web the current "killer-app" of the dot-com world.  However,  users still face many problems.  Users have to find the right video  and the right segment within the video.  Locally stored files provide easy (but still not very sophisticated) access to individual points  in the video by utilizing a seek slider.  If the video is streamed  over the Internet, this slider loses much of its attraction.  Every  accessed point in the video requires the video player to buffer,  which causes a time lag.  The mediacaptain is a system that addresses this issue by using supplementary material like text and graphics to provide indices.  This time-aligned material is used to help the user make an informed decision on whether they want to watch a video and  if so, what portions.  This web-enabled prototype called mediacaptain emerged from user surveys and is demonstrated on several content  types and represents an advanced experience with video on the Web.  5 Refs.

Title: Supporting program comprehension using semantic and structural  information
Abstract: The paper focuses on investigating the combined use of semantic and  structural information of programs to support the comprehension  tasks involved in the maintenance and reengineering of software  systems.  Here, semantic refers to the domain specific issues (both  problem and development domains) of a software system.  The other  dimension, structural, refers to issues such as the actual syntactic structure of the program along with the control and data flow that  it represents.  An advanced information retrieval method, latent  semantic indexing, is used to define a semantic similarity measure  between software components.  Components within a software system are then clustered together using this similarity measure.  Simple  structural information (i.e., file organization) of the software  system is then used to assess the semantic cohesion of the clusters  and files, with respect to each other.  The measures are formally  defined for general application.  A set of experiments is presented  which demonstrates how these measures can assist in the  understanding of a nontrivial software system, namely a version of  NCSA Mosaic.  49 Refs.

Title: Community search assistant
Abstract: This paper describes a new software agent, the community search  assistant, which recommends related searches to users of search  engines.  The community search assistant enables communities of users to search in a collaborative fashion.  All queries submitted by the  community are stored in the form of a graph.  Links are made between  queries that are found to be related.  Users can peruse the network  of related queries in an ordered way: following a path from a first  cousin, to a second cousin to a third cousin, etc. to a set of  search results.  The first key idea behind the use of query graphs is that the determination of relatedness depends on the documents  returned by the queries, not on the actual terms in the queries  themselves.  The second key idea is that the construction of the  query graph transforms single user usage of information networks  (e.g. search) into collaborative usage: all users can tap into the  knowledge base of queries submitted by others.  13 Refs.

Title: CRUMPET: Creation of user-friendly mobile services personalised for  tourism
Abstract: More and more people combine several purposes with travelling, such  as business, leisure, entertainment, and education.  Such people may  not have time to pre-plan a travel schedule in detail.  They need  location-aware information about the destination domain and expect  individualised information and services.  The EU funded research  project CRUMPET addresses these factors and will provide new  information delivery services for a far more heterogeneous tourist  population.  The services proposed by CRUMPET take advantage of  integrating four key emerging technology domains and applying them  to the tourism domain: location-aware services, personalised user  interaction, seamlessly accessible multi-media mobile communication, and smart component-based middleware or 'smartware' that uses  Multi-Agent Technology.  7 Refs.

Title: Distinctiveness-sensitive nearest-neighbor search for efficient  similarity retrieval of multimedia information
Abstract: Nearest neighbor (NN) search in high dimensional feature space is  widely used for similarity retrieval of multimedia information.   However, recent research results in the database literature reveal  that a curious problem happens in high dimensional space.  Since high dimensional space has high degree of freedom, points could be so  scattered that every, distance between them might yield no  significant difference.  In this case, we can say that the NN is  indistinctive because many points exist at the similar distance.  To  make matters worse, indistinctive NNs require more search cost  because search completes only after choosing the NN from plenty of  strong candidates.  In order to circumvent the harmful effect of  indistinctive NNs, this paper presents a new NN search algorithm  which determines the distinctiveness of the NN during search  operation.  This enables us not only to cut down search cost but also to distinguish distinctive NNs from indistinctive ones.  These  advantages are especially beneficial to interactive retrieval  systems.  13 Refs.

Title: Telcordia LSI engine: Implementation and scalability issues
Abstract: Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), a vector space-based approach to  information retrieval, has been proven to be an effective tool in  correlating and retrieving relevant documents.  While much work has  been published on LSI, most of it addresses the algorithmic or  theoretical basis of the model.  Little, if any, presents  implementation issues in practice.  In this paper, we describe a  production-level implementation of LSI.  The system integrates  components including document collection and preprocessing, singular value decomposition (SVD), multilingual processing, and a tree-based access method for similarity querying.  We discuss implementation  issues encountered during the development of the system.  In  particular, we address scalability issues in the query engine and  various components of the system, and present lessons learned.  12  Refs.

Title: Enabling personalized recommendation on the Web based on user  interests and behaviors
Abstract: The dramatic growth of the Web has brought about the rapid  accumulation of data and the increasing possibility of information  sharing.  As the population on the Web grows, the analysis of user  interests and behaviors will provide hints on how to improve the  quality of service.  In this paper, we define user interests and  behaviors based on the documents read by the user.  A method for  mining such user interests and behaviors is then presented.  In this  way, each user is associated with a set of interests and behaviors,  which is stored in the user profile.  In addition, we define six  types of user profiles and a distance measure to classify users into clusters.  Finally, three kinds of recommendation services using the  clustered results are realized.  For performance evaluation, we  implement these services on the Web to make experiments on real  data/users.  The results show that the average acceptance rates of  these services range from 71.5% to 94.6%.  23 Refs.

Title: Eliminating overflow for large-scale mobility databases in cellular  telephone networks
Abstract: In a cellular phone system, mobility databases called visitor  location registers (VLRs) are used to temporarily hold the  subscription information of the roaming users who visit the service  area of the VLR.  When the users leave the VLR area, the  corresponding records in the VLR are deleted.  Due to user mobility,  the capacity of the VLR may not be large enough to hold information  for all visitors in the VLR area at some time periods.  This issue is called VLR overflow.  This paper describes a record replacement  policy to allow mobile users to receive services in the VLR overflow situation.  We utilize analytic modeling to investigate the  performance of the replacement policy.  The study indicates that our  approach effectively eliminates the VLR overflow problem with  insignificant extra overhead.  13 Refs.

Title: Query processing in TREC-6
Abstract: Recent improvements in commercial information retrieval systems have  focused on query processing as a means to improve the recall and  precision of users' queries.  This paper discusses three facets of  this problem and then describes an attempt to address them so as to  improve the retrieval performance.  Specifically, this paper  considers how techniques for identifying key concepts, selecting  synonyms and related terms, and detecting phrases can be combined to expand queries to increase recall and precision.  A series of  experimental studies are described as performed in the context of  the Sixth Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  Moderate benefits were achieved through query processing, though additional work needs to  be done to fully incorporate phrases, eliminate noise words, and  take advantage of co-occurrence analysis developed in this study.   Most notably, related terms derived from a statistical thesaurus  helped significantly in some queries, while having the opposite  effect in others.  (Author abstract) 11 Refs.

In this paper we describe the  stream architecture', a  method we designed to combine evidence obtained from several  different document representations.  Some of the document  representations used in the experiments described here involved the  use of phrases and proper names computed using Natural Language  Processing techniques.

Title: Using clustering and SuperConcepts within SMART: TREC 6
Abstract: The SMART information retrieval project emphasizes completely  automatic approaches to the understanding and retrieval of large  quantities of text.  We continue our work in TREC 6, performing runs  in the routing, ad hoc, and foreign language environments, including cross-lingual runs.  The major focus for TREC 6 is on trying to  maintain the balance of the query - attempting to ensure the various aspects of the original query are appropriately addressed,  especially while adding expansion terms.  Exactly the same procedure  is used for foreign language environments as for English; our tenet  is that good information retrieval techniques are more powerful than linguistic knowledge.  We also give an interesting cross-lingual run, assuming that French and English are closely enough related so that  a query in one language can be run directly on a collection in the  other language by just  correcting' the spelling of the query words.  This is quite successful for most queries.  (Author abstract) 13  Refs.

Title: Further reflections on TREC
Abstract: The paper reviews the TREC Programme up to TREC-6 (1997), considering the test results, the substantive findings for IR that follow and  the lessons TREC offers for IR evaluation.  The paper focuses on the  ad hoc retrieval task, with discussion of other test tracks as  appropriate.  The paper summarizes the structure of the TREC work and analyses the experimental data in some detail.  The analysis of the  tests is presented through a series of key questions about indexing  models, document and query descriptions, search strategies, etc. The assessment confirms that statistically-based methods perform as well as any, and that the nature and treatment of the user's request is  by far the dominant factor in performance.  One implication is that  TREC should move into a new phase targeted on key comparisons and  task specifications designed to deliver substantive new information, in particular shifting towards situated IR that addresses the user's context and contribution to searching.

Title: Overview of the Sixth Text REtrieval Conference (TREC-6)
Abstract: The Text REtrieval Conference is a workshop series designed to  encourage research on text retrieval for realistic applications by  providing large test collections, uniform scoring procedures and a  forum for organizations interested in comparing results.  TREC  contains two main retrieval tasks plus optional subtasks that allow  participants to focus on particular common subproblems in retrieval.  The emphasis on individual experiments evaluated in a common setting has proven to be very successful.  In the six years since the  beginning of TREC, the state of the art in retrieval effectiveness  has approximately doubled, and technology transfer among research  labs and between research systems and commercial products has  accelerated.  In addition, TREC has sponsored the first large-scale  evaluations of Chinese language retrieval, retrieval of speech and  retrieval across different languages.  (Author abstract) 34 Refs.

Title: Region-based image database system using colour and texture
Abstract: In this paper, a region-based image database system is presented.   When an image is entered into the database it is first clustered  into similar looking regions using the local colour and texture  properties of the image.  The mean colour and texture properties of  these regions along with their location and size are then stored as  an index into that image.  To query the database, the user specifies  an object on which the same texture and colour properties are  calculated.  A neural network is trained on these features and then  used to search through the indices of the database images.  All  similar looking regions in the images are shown as the results to  the query.

Title: MAP: Design and implementation of a mobile agents' platform
Abstract: The recent development of telecommunication networks has contributed to the success of applications such as information retrieval and electronic commerce, as well as all the services that take advantage of communication in distributed systems.  In this area, the emerging technology of mobile agents aroused considerable interest.  Mobile agents are applications that can move through the network for carrying out a given task on behalf of the user.  In this work we present a platform called MAP (Mobile Agents Platform) for the development and the management of mobile agents.  The language used both for developing the platform and for carrying out the agents is Java.  The platform gives the user all the basic tools needed for creating some applications based on the use of agents.  It enables us to create, run, suspend, resume, deactivate, reactivate local agents, to stop their execution, to make them communicate each other and migrate.  (Author abstract) 37 Refs.

Title: FDBSCAN: A fast DBSCAN algorithm
Abstract: Clustering is an important application area for many fields including data mining, statistical data analysis, pattern recognition, image processing, and other business applications, Up to now, many algorithms for clustering have been developed.  Contributed from the database research community, DBSCAN algorithm is an outstanding representative of clustering algorithms for its good performance in clustering spatial data.  Relying on a density-based notion of clusters, DBSCAN is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape.  It requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value of it.  In this paper, a fast DBSCAN algorithm (FDBSCAN) is developed which considerably speeds up the original DBSCAN algorithm.  Unlike DBSCAN, FDBSCAN uses only a small number of representative points in a core point's neighborhood as seeds to expand the cluster such that the execution frequency of region query and consequently the I/O cost are reduced.  Experimental results show that FDBSCAN is effective and efficient in clustering large-scale databases, and it is faster than the original DBSCAN algorithm by several times.

Title: Integrated scheme for automated video abstraction based on unsupervised cluster-validity analysis
Abstract: Key frames and previews are two forms of a video abstract, widely used for various applications in video browsing and retrieval systems.  We propose in this paper a novel method for generating these two abstract forms for an arbitrary video sequence.  The underlying principle of the proposed method is the removal of the visual-content redundancy among video frames.  This is done by first applying multiple partitional clustering to all frames of a video sequence and then selecting the most suitable clustering option(s) using an unsupervised procedure for cluster-validity analysis.  In the last step, key frames are selected as centroids of obtained optimal clusters.  Video shots, to which key frames belong, are concatenated to form the preview sequence.

Title: Integrated approach for content-based video object segmentation and retrieval
Abstract: Object-based video data representations enable unprecedented functionalities of content access and manipulation.  In this paper, we present an integrated approach using region-based analysis for semantic video object segmentation and retrieval.  We first present an active system that combines low-level region segmentation with user inputs for defining and tracking semantic video objects.  The proposed technique is novel in using an integrated feature fusion framework for tracking and segmentation at both region and object levels.  Experimental results and extensive performance evaluation show excellent results compared to existing systems.  Building upon the segmentation framework, we then present a unique region-based query system for semantic video object.  The model facilitates powerful object search, such as spatio-temporal similarity searching at multiple levels.  (Author abstract) 26 Refs.

Title: Organization considerations for retrieval of stored data via key recovery methods
Abstract: The purpose of this document is to identify technical and procedural issues that need to be considered when selecting and deploying key recovery systems to enable emergency recovery of data that is stored or archived in encrypted form.  Emergency recovery of encrypted data is necessary in the event that the decryption keys are unavailable through normal key management mechanisms.  In many cases, the need to support emergency recovery of encrypted data is vital to ongoing operations and jurisdictional policy compliance.  A disaster recovery plan may also give consideration to an ability to recover many data keys by using a single key recovery request.  (Author abstract)

Title: Enhancing CSS-based shape retrieval for objects with shallow concavities
Abstract: Curvature scale space (CSS) image is a multi-scale organization of the inflection points of a closed planar curve as it is smoothed.  It consists of several arch shape contours, each related to a concavity or a convexity of the curve.  The maxima of these contours have already been used as shape descriptors to find similar shapes in large image databases.  In this article, we address the problem of shallow concavities.  These may give rise to large contours in the CSS image.  These contours may then match those corresponding to deep and wide concavities during the matching process.  The phenomenon can be explained by recalling the fact that Gaussian smoothing leads to an approximation of geometric heat equation deformation.  We have introduced a method to enrich the CSS image and create different contours for different types of concavities.  We tested the proposed method on a database of 1100 images of marine creatures.  A significant improvement was observed in the performance of the system on shapes with shallow segments.  (Author abstract) 33 Refs.

Title: Intelligent assistant for design and material engineers in the submarine cable industry
Abstract: This paper describes an industrial application of case-based reasoning in engineering.  The application involves an integration of case-based reasoning (CBR) retrieval techniques with a relational database.  The database is specially designed as a repository of experiential knowledge and with the CBR application in mind such as to include qualitative search indices.  The application is for an intelligent assistant for design and material engineers in the submarine cable industry.  The system consists of three components; a material classifier and a database of experiential knowledge and a CBR system is used to retrieve similar past cases based on component descriptions.  Work has shown that an uncommon retrieval technique, hierarchical searching, well represents several search indices and that this techniques aids the implementation of advanced techniques such as context sensitive weights.  The system is currently undergoing user testing at the Alcatel Submarine Cables site in Greenwich.  Plans are for wider testing and deployment over several sites internationally.

Title: Level search schemes for information filtering and retrieval
Abstract: Latent semantic indexing (LSI) has been demonstrated to outperform lexical matching in information retrieval.  However, the enormous cost associated with the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the large term-by-document matrix becomes a barrier for its application to scalable information retrieval.  This work shows that information filtering using level search techniques can reduce the SVD computation cost for LSI.  For each query, level search extracts a much smaller subset of the original term-by-document matrix, containing on average 27% of the original non-zero entries.  When LSI is applied to such subsets, the average precision can degrade by as much as 23% due to level search filtering.  However, for some document collections an increase in precision has also been observed.  Further enhancement of level search can be based on a pruning scheme which deletes terms connected to only one document from the query-specific submatrix.  Such pruning has achieved a 65% reduction (on average) in the number of non-zeros with a precision loss of 5% for most collections.  (Author abstract) 18 Refs.

Title: Use of an electronic medical record in a department of cardiology
Abstract: A computer - network infrastructure was realized to integrate the different remote cardiovascular diagnostic laboratories with the data derived from CCU and the administrative information.  A variety of heterogeneous data, texts, signals, images is gathered from each peripheral unit, stored into a relational database (ARCA), processed and presented to health-care personnel by network-connected clinical workstations.  From August 1999 to August 2000 the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) of 754 patients hospitalized in a Cardiological department were collected; 7808 procedures were digitally integrated and for each patient was possible to calculate the number of tests performed during hospitalization and the quantity of drugs assumed.  The use of EMR allowed to obtain rapidly a clinical data integration; to access to patient data from any clinical Lab; to collect information to obtain patient cost definition.

Abstract: In this paper it is proposed to construct an automatic control system design environment with engineering knowledge-based management as an integral part.  The control design environment consists of a set of control design modules and a number of control systems models that have to be designed or are to be designed.  The knowledge objects are distributed in multiple heterogeneous data sources.  Multi-agent system approach to the design of resource management components in the heterogeneous environment is discussed.  Cooperative agents communicate through networked environment.  The database structure is determined dynamically by XML tools.  Meta-knowledge is described as RDF-file that makes it possible to intelligent retrieval of information.

Title: Seven degrees of separation in mobile ad hoc networks
Abstract: We present an architecture that enables the sharing of information among mobile, wireless, collaborating hosts that are intermittently connected to the Internet.  Participants in the system obtain data objects from Internet-connected servers, cache them and exchange them with others who are interested in them.  The system exploits the fact that there is a high locality of information access within a geographic area.  It aims to increase the data availability to participants with lost connectivity to the Internet.  We investigate how user mobility and query patterns affect data dissemination in such an environment.  We discuss the main components of the system and possible applications.  Finally, we present simulation results that show that the ad hoc networks can be very effective in distributing popular information.  (Author abstract) 15 Refs.

Abstract: Agent-based computing represents a new and very significant paradigm for building a wide range of software applications.  In this paper, we describe our research project on the development of a software agent-based architecture for Distributed Problem Solving (DPS).  Such agents must be heterogeneous and adaptive in nature to satisfy increasing requests due to cooperation capabilities exhibited by DPS applications (e.g. computer vision applications such as biomedical imaging and image retrieval on the Web, distributed and intelligent information retrieval, and so on).  We give a brief introduction to the overall architecture design and focus our attention on the lowest level agents, called W-bots (Working Software Robots).  We define the nature of such agents and describe their ways of interaction and their adaptive capabilities.  (Author abstract) 17 Refs.

Title: Iris recognition for biometric identification using dyadic wavelet  transform zero-crossing
Abstract: In this work, a new biometric identification approach based on the  human iris pattern is proposed.  The main idea of this technique is  to represent the features of the iris by fine-to-coarse  approximations at different resolution levels based on the discrete  dyadic wavelet transform zero-crossing representation.  The resulting one-dimensional (1-D) signals are compared with model features using different distances.  Before performing the feature extraction, a  pre-processing step is to be made by image processing techniques,  isolating the iris and enhancing the area of study.  The proposed  technique is translation, rotation and scale invariant.  Results will show a classification success above 98% achieving an Equal Error  Rate equal to 0, 21% and the possibility of having null False  Acceptance Rates with low False Rejection Rates.  9 Refs.

Title: Accelerated volume ray-casting using texture mapping
Abstract: Acceleration techniques for volume ray-casting are primarily based on pre-computed data structures that allow one to efficiently traverse  empty or homogeneous regions.  In order to display volume data that  successively undergoes color lookups, however, the data structures  have to be re-built continuously.  In this paper we propose a  technique that circumvents this drawback using hardware accelerated  texture mapping.  In a first rendering pass we employ graphics  hardware to interactively determine for each ray where the material  is hit.  In a second pass ray-casting is performed, but ray traversal starts right in front of the previously determined regions.  The  algorithm enables interactive classification and it considerably  accelerates the view dependent display of selected materials and  surfaces from volume data.  In contrast to other techniques that are  solely based on texture mapping our approach requires less memory  and accurately performs the composition of material contributions  along the ray.  36 Refs.

Title: Utilizing a class labeling feature in an adaptive bayesian classifier
Abstract: In this paper, the Mean-Field Bayesian Data Reduction Algorithm is  developed that adaptively trains on data containing missing values.   In the basic data model for this algorithm each feature vector of a  given class contains a class-labeling feature.  Thus, the methods  developed here are used to demonstrate performance for problems in  which it is desired to adapt the existing training data with data  containing missing values, such as the class-labeling feature.  Given that, the Mean-Field Bayesian Data Reduction Algorithm labels the  adapted data, while simultaneously determining those features that  provide best classification performance.  That is, performance is  improved by reducing the data to mitigate the effects of the curse  of dimensionality.  Further, to demonstrate performance, the  algorithm is compared to the classifier that does not adapt and  bases its decisions on only the prior training data, and also the  optimal clairvoyant classifier.  11 Refs.

Title: Multi-target tracking on intensity-modulated sensor data
Abstract: Tracking energy on an intensity-modulated sensor output typically  requires windowing, thresholding, and/or interpolation to arrive at  "point measurements " to feed the tracking algorithm.  Conventional  trackers are point trackers, and point measurement estimation  procedures pose problems for tracking signal energy that is  distributed across many sensor cells.  Such signals are sometimes  termed "over-resolved." Large arrays provide greater resolution with the potential for improved detection and classification performance, but higher resolution is in direct conflict with tracking  over-resolved signals.  The Histogram-Probabilistic Multi-Hypothesis  Tracker (H-PMHT) algorithm addresses these issues and provides a  means for modeling and tracking signals that are spread across  several contiguous sensor cells.  H-PMHT models the cell responses as a received energy histogram, and the probability density underlying  this histogram is modeled by a mixture density.  Elements of the  H-PMHT signal model, theory, and algorithm are presented for linear  Gauss-Markov targets.  Tracking examples using simulated azimuth beam data are presented.  13 Refs.

Title: Evaluation of a matrix factorization method for data reduction and  the unsupervised clustering of hyperspectral data using second order statistics
Abstract: We investigate a hyperspectral data reduction technique based on a  matrix factorization method using the notion of linear independence  instead of information measure, as an alternative to Principal  Component Analysis (PCA) or the Karhunen-Loeve Transform.  The  technique is applied to a hyperspectral database whose spectral  samples are known.  We proceed to cluster such dimension-reduced  databases with an unsupervised second order statistics clustering  method and we compare those results to those produced by first order statistics.  We illustrate the above methodology by applying it to  several spectral databases.  Since we know the class to which each  sample belongs to in the database, we can effectively assess the  algorithms' clustering/classification accuracy.  In addition to using unsupervised clustering of data for purposes of image segmentation,  we investigate this algorithm as a means for improving the integrity of spectral databases by removing spurious samples.  16 Refs.

Title: Evolving forest fire burn severity classification algorithms for  multi-spectral imagery
Abstract: Between May 6 and May 18, 2000, the Cerro Grande/Los Alamos wildfire  burned approximately 43,000 acres (17,500 ha) and 235 residences in  the town of Los Alamos, NM.  Initial estimates of forest damage  included 17,000 acres (6,900 ha) of 70-100% tree mortality.   Restoration efforts following the fire were complicated by the large scale of the fire, and by the presence of extensive natural and  man-made hazards.  These conditions forced a reliance on remote  sensing techniques for mapping and classifying the bum region.   During and after the fire, remote-sensing data was acquired from a  variety of aircraft-based and satellite-based sensors, including  Landsat 7. We now report on the application of a machine learning  technique, implemented in a software package called GENIE, to the  classification of forest fire burn severity using Landsat 7 ETM+  multispectral imagery.  The details of this automatic classification  are compared to the manually produced burn classification, which was derived from field observations and manual interpretation of  high-resolution aerial color/infrared photography.  24 Refs.

Title: Analytic performance bounds on SAR-image target recognition using  physics-based signatures
Abstract: In recent years, synthetic aperture radars (SARs) have been used to  detect man-made targets and to distinguish them from naturally  occurring background.  This paper continues development of a  fundamental, physics-based approach to assessing the performance of  SAR-based automatic target recognition (ATR) systems.  A major thrust of this effort is to quantify the performance advantages that accrue when the recognition processor exploits the detailed signatures of  the target's component reflectors, e.g., their specularity, their  polarization properties, etc. Its purpose is to assess target  classification performance of a SAR-based ATR, starting from a  foundation of rigorous, physics-based signal models developed from  the electromagnetic scattering theory.  New lower and upper bounds on the probability of correct classification (PCC) are developed for  targets composed of a constellation of geometrically-simple  reflectors.  The performance discrepancy of a conventional  full-resolution processor with respect to an optimal  whitening-filter processor is discussed.  6 Refs.

Title: An information theory for the prediction of SAR target classification performance
Abstract: This paper develops a high level theoretical framework describing  quantitatively the potential ability of a synthetic aperture or  similar imaging radar to classify discrete military targets.   Communications information theory is used to calculate the  information conveyed by the image of a target from the values of  image pixels relative to the non-deterministic fluctuations of those values.  The classification problem being addressed is scoped by  defining a set of target classes and calculating the degree of  deterministic variability present within each class.  The probability of correct classification is determined by setting the information  conveyed by the image against the scope of the classification  problem to be solved.  The theory is validated against simulated  target classification experiments.  It is then shown how the theory  may be applied at a detailed level to a specific target  classification algorithm, and at a high level in  algorithm-independent performance prediction.  1 Refs.

Title: Search algorithms for vector quantization and nearest neighbor  classification
Abstract: The problem of finding the stored template that is closest to a given input pattern is a typical problem in vector quantization (VQ)  encoding and nearest neighbor (NN) pattern classification.  This  paper presents a new Triangle Inequality Nearest Neighbor Search  (TINNS) algorithm that significantly reduces the number of distance  calculations.  This algorithm is appropriate in applications for  which the computational cost of making a distance calculation is  relatively expensive.  Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) is one such application.  This new algorithm achieves improved performance by  guiding the order in which templates are tested, and using  inequality constraints to prune the search space.  We compare TINNS  with another competing approach, as well as exhaustive search, and  show that there is an appropriate application domain for each  algorithm.  Results are given for three applications, VQ for image  compression, NN search over random templates, and target recognition in synthetic aperture radar image data.  16 Refs.

Title: Comparison of some HRR-classification algorithms
Abstract: ATR using HRR-signatures have recently gained lot of attention.  A  number of classification methods have been proposed using different  target descriptions.  The traditionally used classifier utilizing  mean square error between magnitude only range profiles and  templates suffers from problems with interfering scatterers.  Several attempts to improve the MSE classifier both during the template  formation process and in the matching have been made.  We have  recently presented a method that matches complex HRR signatures to  target descriptions that use scattering centers.  This method handle  the unknown phases of the centers and thus overcomes the problem of  interference between scatterers.  In this paper we compare our method with a number of other methods that uses magnitude only range  profiles.  Those includes Mean-templates, Eigen- templates and the  Specular and Diffuse scattering models.  9 Refs.

Title: Conformal mapping-based hand-written words and sentences  representation and recognition
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a technique for handwritten words and  sentences representation and recognition.  The proposed method is  based on complex variables and conformal mapping methodology.  In  particular, in a previous work, through a complex variable  methodology and conformal mapping process, we demonstrated the  ability to (a) recognize shapes, and (b) concisely represent shape  boundaries using a set of polynomial coefficients derived in the  mapping process.  In this work we illustrate how these previous  results can be applied to hand-written words and sentences.  We show  that the words/sentences classification techniques used are adapted  to the feature-coefficients selected and are based on  feature-coefficients similarities in combination with the minimum  distance classifier.  We use as measures the Euclidean distance as  well as well as the covariance matrix eigen-values distance.   Finally, experimental results of handwritten words and sentences are shown to show the power, versatility and robustness of the proposed  technique.  12 Refs.

Title: Image compression using a novel edge-based coding algorithm
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel edge-based coding algorithm for  image compression.  The proposed coding scheme is the predictive  version of the original algorithm, which we presented earlier in  literature.  In the original version, an image is block coded  according to the level of visual activity of individual blocks,  following a novel edge-oriented classification stage.  Each block is  then represented by a set of parameters associated with the pattern  appearing inside the block.  The use of these parameters at the  receiver reduces the cost of reconstruction significantly.  In the  present study, we extend and improve the performance of the existing technique by exploiting the expected spatial redundancy across the  neighboring blocks.  Satisfactory coded images at competitive bit  rate with other block-based coding techniques have been obtained.  7  Refs.

Title: Robust automatic video-conferencing with multiple cameras and  microphones
Abstract: An automatic video-conferencing system is proposed which employs  acoustic source localization, video face tracking and pose  estimation, and multi-channel speech enhancement.  The video portion  of the system tracks talkers by utilizing source motion, contour  geometry, color data, and simple facial features.  Decisions  involving which camera to use are based on an estimate of the head's gazing angle.  This head pose estimation is achieved using a very  general head model which employs hairline features and a learned  network classification procedure.  Finally, a wavelet microphone  array technique is used to create an enhanced speech waveform to  accompany the recorded video signal.  The system presented in this  paper is robust to both visual clutter (e.g. ovals in the scene of  interest which are not faces) and audible noise (e.g. reverberations and background noise).  10 Refs.

Title: TV program classification based on face and text processing
Abstract: In this paper we describe a system to classify TV programs into  predefined categories based on the analysis of their video contents.  This is very useful in intelligent display and storage systems that  can select channels and record or skip contents according to the  consumer's preference.  Distinguishable patterns exist in different  categories of TV programs in terms of human faces and super-imposed  text.  By applying face and text tracking to a number of training  video segments, including commercials, news, sitcoms, and soaps, we  have identified patterns within each category of TV programs in a  predefined feature space that reflects the face and text  characteristics of the video.  A given video segment is projected to  the feature space and compared against the distribution of known  categories of TV programs.  Domain-knowledge is used to help the  classification.  Encouraging results have been achieved so far in our initial experiments.  11 Refs.

Title: Expressive semantics for automatic annotation and retrieval of video  streams
Abstract: For the practical use of video retrieval systems, access must be  provided so as to bridge the semantic gap between the system and  users.  Semiotics, which is concerned with the production of sense  and of the way in which it is received by humans appears as the  formal background for this goal.  According to semiotics, semantics  can be extracted at different levels of signification through a  suitable set of roles which combine visual and auditory signs.  An  intermediate semantic level, which has to do with the combination of low-level signs, like color, motion, shapes and their changes  through time, accounts for the video expressiveness and the emotions provoked.  It can be obtained automatically and is often useful for  retrieval by content and similarity-based classification of video  streams.  Applications to retrieval of commercials based on  expressive semantics are discussed.  10 Refs.

Title: Incorporate discriminant analysis with EM algorithm in image  retrieval
Abstract: One of the difficulties of Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is  the gap between high-level concepts and low-level image features,  e.g., color and texture.  Relevance feedback was proposed to take  into account of the above characteristics in CBIR.  Although  relevance feedback incrementally supplies more information for fine  retrieval, two challenges exist: (1) the labeled images from the  relevance feedback are still very limited compared to the large  unlabeled images in the image database.  (2) relevance feedback does  not offer a specific technique to automatically weight the low-level feature.  In this paper, image retrieval is formulated as a  transductive learning problem by combining unlabeled images in  supervised learning to achieve better classification.  Experimental  results show that the proposed approach has a satisfactory  performance for image retrieval applications.  9 Refs.

Title: Optimal image scaling using pixel classification
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to optimal image scaling called  Resolution Synthesis (RS).  In RS, the pixel being interpolated is  first classified in the context of a window of neighboring pixels;  and then the corresponding high-resolution pixels are obtained by  filtering with coefficients that depend upon the classification.  RS  is based on a stochastic model explicitly reflecting the fact that  pixels falls into different classes such as edges of different  orientation and smooth textures.  We present a simple derivation to  show that RS generates the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE)  estimate of the high-resolution image, given the low-resolution  image.  The parameters that specify the stochastic model must be  estimated beforehand in a training procedure that we have formulated as an instance of the well-known expectation-maximization (EM)  algorithm.  We demonstrate that the model parameters generated during the training may be used to obtain superior results even for input  images that were not used during the training.  16 Refs.

Title: Multistatic passive radar imaging using the Smoothed Pseudo  Wigner-Ville Distribution
Abstract: We investigate passive radar imaging of aircraft using reflected TV  signals.  We apply a Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution  (SPWVD)-based SAR imaging algorithm to two different scenarios.  In  the first simulation, multistatic VHF-band dataset generated by Fast Illinois Solver Code (FISC) is used.  In the second simulation, a  more realistic simulated passive radar dataset is used.  A set of  instantaneous images are produced by our algorithm, which have  higher resolution and show more detail and features of the aircraft  than can be obtained by Direct Fourier Reconstruction (DFR).  The set of images provides visually more information about the target and  helps to estimate its shape and features.  This study suggests that  the SPWVD-based imaging might be useful in passive radar imaging and target classification.  10 Refs.

Title: Category-based image retrieval
Abstract: This work presents a novel approach to content-based image retrieval  in categorical multimedia databases.  The images are indexed using a  combination of text and content descriptors.  The categories are  viewed as semantic clusters of images and are used to confine the  search space.  Keywords are used to identify candidate categories.   Content-based retrieval is performed in these categories using  multiple image features.  Relevance feedback is used to learn the  user's intent-query specification and feature-weighting-with minimal user-interface abstraction.  The method is applied to a large number  of images collected from a popular categorical structure on the  World Wide Web.  Results show that efficient and accurate performance is achievable by exploiting the semantic classification represented  by the categories.  The relevance feedback loop allows the content  descriptor weightings to be determined without exposing the  calculations to the user.  5 Refs.

Title: On the study of lossless compression of computer generated compound  images
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of lossless compression of computer  generated compound images that contain not only photographic images  but also text and graphic images.  We present a simple backward  adaptive classification scheme to separate the image source into  three classes: smooth regions, text regions and image regions.   Different probability models are assigned within each class to  maximize the compression performance.  We also extend our scheme to  exploit the interplane dependency for coding color images.  The  segmentation results of the reference color plane are used as the  contexts for the classification and coding of the current color  plane.  Our new lossless coder significantly outperforms current  state-of-the-art coders such as CALIC and JPEG-LS for compound  images with modest computational complexity.  9 Refs.

Title: Scene break detection and classification using a block-wise  difference method
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to the detection and the classification  of effects in video sequences.  We deal with effects such as cuts,  fades, dissolves, and camera motion.  A global motion compensation  based on block matching and a measure of block mean intensities are  used to detect all the effects.  We compute the dominant motion  vectors to detect the camera motion for each shot and we use the  percentage of blocks with sudden intensity variations or gradual  intensity change to detect change effects between video shots.  The  approach can handle complex motion during gradual effects as well as the precise detection of effect lengths.  Both synthetic and real  evidences are presented to demonstrate how this approach can  efficiently classify effects in video sequences involving  significant motion.  7 Refs.

Title: Integrated multimedia processing for topic segmentation and  classification
Abstract: In this paper we describe integrated multimedia processing for Video  Scout, a system that segments and indexes TV programs according to  their audio, visual and transcript information.  Video Scout  represents a future direction for personal video recorders.  In  addition to using electronic program guide metadata and a user  profile.  Scout allows the users to request specific topics within a  program.  For example, users can request the video clip of the  President speaking from a half-hour news program.  Video Scout has  three modules: (i) Video Pre-Processing, (ii) Segmentation and  Indexing, and (iii) Storage and User Interface.  Segmentation and  Indexing, the core of the system, incorporates a Bayesian framework  that integrates information from the audio, visual, and transcript  (closed captions) domains.  This framework uses three layers to  process low, mid, and high-level multimedia information.  The  high-level layer generates semantic information about TV program  topics.  This paper describes the elements of the system and presents results from running Video Scout on real TV programs.  11 Refs.

Title: Improved ROI and within frame discriminant features for lipreading
Abstract: We study three aspects of designing appearance based visual features  for automatic lipreading: (a) The choice of the video region of  interest (ROI), on which image transform features are obtained; (b)  The extraction of speech discriminant features at each frame; and  (c) The use of temporal information to improve visual speech  modeling.  In particular, with respect to (a), we propose a ROI that  includes the speaker's jaw and cheeks, in addition to the  traditionally used mouth/lip region; with respect to (b) and (c), we propose the use of a two-stage linear discriminant analysis, both  within frame, as well as across a large number of frames.  On a  large-vocabulary, continuous speech audio-visual database, the  proposed visual features result in a 13% absolute reduction in  visual-only word error rate over a baseline visual front end, and in an additional 28% relative improvement in audio-visual over  audio-only phonetic classification accuracy.  19 Refs.

Title: Recognition of anatomically relevant objects with binary partition  trees
Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate the application of a binary partition  tree to the watershed segmentation with graph merging.  An adjacency  graph is used to represent the regions found in a watershed  transform, merging of these regions is required to combine these  regions for further processing.  Each node in the binary partition  tree represents a larger region that results from the merging of two small regions.  Starting from the root node, image areas of child  nodes can successively be investigated whether they belong to a  certain class of objects.  In our application we are e.g. interested  in finding anatomical objects such as skull, lung, or heart in an  x-ray image.  The outlined classification strategy considers only a  few, relevant region combinations and thus permits the introduction  of sophisticated classification rules without compromising overall  computation time.  The use of rules improves the recognition rate  over simpler linear or box-type classifiers.  4 Refs.

Title: MRI ventilation analysis by merging parametric active contours
Abstract: A novel technique that combines MR imaging of hyperpolarized helium  gas and conventional MR imaging facilitates high resolution imaging  of lung functionality for the first time.  In this paper, we put  forth a segmentation method for measuring the total lung air space  and a classification approach to computing the functional air space.  For segmentation, we introduce a parametric active contour that  allows automated merging of multiple contours.  The active contour  technique uses gradient vector flow modified and strengthened by a  boundary condition that inhibits contour crossover.  The active  contour approach is computationally inexpensive and is independent  of initial contour placement.  For classification of the functional  lung air space in the helium images, a fuzzy c-means technique is  applied.  The classification results, in conjunction with the  segmentation, allow the analysis of ventilation.  The resultant  biomedical image analysis tool will be used in determining the  efficacy of certain respiratory treatments.  10 Refs.

Title: An automatic classification system of urine bladder tumors employing  morphological and textural nuclear features
Abstract: In this paper, the performance of three classifiers is evaluated in  an attempt to achieve a more objective grading of urinary bladder  tumors.  95 cases were classified according to WHO grading system by  pathologists in three classes: grade I, grade II, and grade III.   Each case was represented by 36 nuclear features.  The Minimum  Distance, the Least Mean Square, and the Bayes classifier were  implemented in a two stage hierarchical tree.  Classification  accuracy of each hierarchical tree was also tested in relation to  direct tumor grading.  The Bayes classifier provided the best overall system accuracy of 74.5% employing a four-feature vector and the  Leave One Out Method.  Grade I and grade III tumors were recognized  as two distinct entities, whereas tumors of grade II, were poorly  discriminated from tumors of grade I and II.  Nuclear features could  be of value in a more objective grading of urine bladder cancer.  15  Refs.

Title: Detection of lesions in endoscopic video using textural descriptors  on wavelet domain supported by artificial neural network  architectures
Abstract: Video processing for classification purposes in medical imaging is an area with great importance.  In this paper a framework for  classification of suspicious lesions using the video produced during an endoscopic session is presented.  The proposed approach is based  on a feature extraction scheme that uses second order statistical  information of the wavelet transformation.  These features are used  as input to a Multilayer Feedforward Neural Network (MFNN)  architecture, which has been trained using features of normal and  tumor regions.  The system uses a limited number of frames with a  rather small population of training vectors.  The classification  results are promising, since the system has been proven capable to  classify and locate regions, that correspond to lesions with a  success of 94 up to 99%, in a sequence of the video-frames.  The  proposed methodology can be used as a valuable diagnostic tool that  may assist physicians to identify possible tumor regions or  malignant formations.  12 Refs.

Title: A comparison of discrete and continuous output modeling techniques  for a Pseudo-2D Hidden Markov Model face recognition system
Abstract: Face recognition has become an important topic within the field of  pattern recognition and computer vision.  In this field a number of  different approaches to feature extraction, modeling and  classification techniques have been tested.  However, many questions  concerning the optimal modeling techniques for high performance face recognition are still open.  The face recognition system developed by our research group uses a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) combined  with the use of Pseudo 2D Hidden Markov Models (P2DHMM).  In the past our system used continuous probability density functions and was  tested on a smaller database.  This paper addresses the question if  there is a major difference in recognition performance with discrete production probabilities compared to continuous ones.  Therefore the  system is tested using a larger subset of the FERET database.  We  will show that we are able to achieve higher recognition scores and  an improvement concerning the computation speed by using discrete  modeling techniques.  12 Refs.

Title: Hierarchical iterative Bayesian approach to automatic recognition of  biological viruses in electron microscope images
Abstract: The diagnosis of biological viruses appearing in electron microscope  images is currently based on time consuming visual examination by  highly trained and experienced medical specialists.  To reduce the  diagnosis time and to de-skill the diagnosis task by allowing the  use of non-specialist medical staff, an automatic virus recognition  method is presented in this paper.  The method is based on a  hierarchical approach to decompose the multi-category multi-feature  classification problem into a set of two-category classification  sub-problems, with each classification sub-problem solved based on  an iterative Bayesian approach.  Probability of misclassification is  minimised by searching an optimum set of features selected from  virus spectra and projecting them to the first principal component  axis.  The proposed method and the reliability are described and  demonstrated using four different biological viruses.  8 Refs.

Title: Face detection in colour images
Abstract: This paper describes the development and quantitative assessment of  an approach to face detection (FD), with the application of image  classification in mind.  The approach entitled 'Crude Automatic Face  Extraction' (CAFE), is based on skin colour segmentation, multiple  image representations and multi-resolution scanning.  It is a direct  extension of an approach by Huang [Pattern Recognition  1994] .  Assessment is in terms of false acceptance (FA) and false rejection (FR) scores using a large quantity of  unconstrained typical Internet images, some of which contain faces  and some of which do not.  Skin-based colour segmentation is  introduced as a front-end, along with several additional low-level  image representations, the benefits of which can be seen by a  reduction in the FA score from 74% to 17%.  It is also noted that a  skin probability map can improve FD significantly.  18 Refs.

Title: Face recognition using fisherface algorithm and elastic graph  matching
Abstract: This paper proposes a face recognition technique that effectively  combines elastic graph matching (EGM) and Fisherface algorithm.  EGM  as one of dynamic link architecture uses not only face-shape but  also the gray information of image, and Fisherface algorithm as a  class specific method is robust about variations such as lighting  direction and facial expression.  In the proposed face recognition  adopting the above two methods, the linear projection per node of an image graph reduces dimensionality of labeled graph vector and  provides a feature space to be used effectively for the  classification.  In comparison with a conventional method, the  proposed approach could obtain satisfactory results in the  perspectives of recognition rates and speeds.  Especially, we could  get maximum recognition rate of 99.3% by leaving-one-out method for  the experiments with the Yale Face Databases.  8 Refs.

Title: Classification of hyperspectral data using support vector machine
Abstract: Classification is one of the most important tasks for remote sensing  image processing.  Most of the existing supervised classification  methods are based on traditional statistics, which can provide ideal results when sample size is tending to infinity.  However, only  finite samples can be acquired in practice.  In addition, many  methods are constrained by high data dimension of hyperspectral  images.  In this paper, a novel learning method, Support Vector  Machine (SVM), is applied to hyperspectral data classification.  This method does not suffer the limitations of data dimensionality and  limited samples.  The foundations of SVM have been developed by  Vapnik and are gaining popularity in field of machine learning due  to many attractive features and promising empirical performance.  In  our experiment, the support vectors, which are critical for  classification, are obtained by learning from the training samples.   Choosing appropriate kernel function and suitable parameters, better classification results are obtained.  10 Refs.

Title: Multiscale color and texture invariants for image recognition
Abstract: This paper proposes a new representation for color texture using a  set of multiscale illuminant invariant features.  The approach was  specifically developed to investigate the feasibility of using  machine vision to automatically monitor populations of animal  species in the Amazon Forest.  The approach uses a combination of  Finlayson's color angle idea and Gabor multichannel filters.  Using a database of color textures from species of Amazonian monkey, and  also a previously published reference database of color regions, we  show that the approach performs better than methods based on color  angles or Gabor filters alone.  The Monkey database was compiled from texture segments extracted from a video of the Amazon Forest using a spatial-temporal segmentation algorithm.  The approach is evaluated  by applying two classification tests in order to measure the quality of the recognition features: Root Mean Square (RMS) analysis and  Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis.  9 Refs.

Title: Image & graphic reader
Abstract: The Image & Graphic Reader (IGR) is an assisting tool to retrieve  information from business charts and present it to blind computer  users.  Different business charts occurring in newspapers and web  sites are analyzed by standard image processing methods.  Common  segmentation algorithms produce homogeneous areas and contour lines  that characterize specific chart types.  Since the component's  geometric features encode the tabular content of the chart, their  dimensions are measured against a certain scale.  This scale is  either explicity defined in the image, like scales of a previously  identified axis or is intrinsic to the type of the chart (e.g.   angles in pie charts).  After the primal classification the extracted tabular data is analyzed to produce a representation that subdivides a chart into predefined levels which are then verbally described.  A  blind user can thus navigate through the levels by keyboard and the  spoken feedback of a speech synthesizer.  17 Refs.

Title: Unsupervised classification using spatial region growing segmentation and fuzzy training.
Abstract: This study has presented an approach to unsupervisedly estimate the  number of classes and the parameters of defining the classes in  order to train the classifier.  Region growing segmentation and local fuzzy classification have been employed to find the sample classes  that well represent the true image.  The segmentation algorithm makes use of spatial contextual information in a hierarchical clustering  procedure and multi-window operating using a pyramid-like structure  to increase computational efficiency.  The fuzzy classification,  which conducts classification by iteratively identifying expected  maximum likelihood parameters of the class, is applied for the  segmented regions in order to determine the sample classes.  The  maximum likelihood classifier has then used the unlabelled regions  to assign them into one of a finite number of classes.  The algorithm has been evaluated with simulated image data with various class  patterns.  6 Refs.

Title: Classification of compound images based on transform coefficient  likelihood
Abstract: Applications like distance learning and teleconferencing often  require compression of images that contain both text and graphics.   Because text and graphics have different properties, a compression  scheme can benefit by treating the textual and graphical portions of such compound images separately.  In this paper, we propose new  methods, called Transform Coefficient Likelihood (TCL) schemes, for  separating the textual and graphical portions of a compound image.   TCL schemes examine the DCT coefficient values of an 8 multiplied by 8 block.  For each coefficient, they refer to stored histograms that  give the likelihood that a certain value occurs in a text block, or  in a graphics block.  They then examine the differences in these two  likelihoods over all the coefficients in the block to decide whether it contains text or graphics.  Experimental results show that the  best TCL methods significantly outperform previously proposed  techniques.  5 Refs.

Title: Feature selection method using neural network
Abstract: Feature selection is an important part of the most learning  algorithms.  Feature selection is used to select the most relevant  features from the data.  By selecting only the relevant features of  the data, higher predictive accuracy can be achieved and  computational load of the classification system can be reduced.  In  this paper simply method for the feature selection using  feed-forward neural networks is presented.  Method described here  starts using one input neuron and adds one input at time until  wanted classification accuracy has been achieved or all attributes  have been chosen.  The algorithm can also be used with other  classification methods.  Test results are given and they are  promising.  Our algorithm reduces the size of the feature space  significantly and improves classification accuracy.  Tests were  performed on the commonly used databases.  Average classification  accuracy, when using selected features, was between 79 and 100%  depending on the used dataset.  13 Refs.

Abstract: The aim of this work was to develop a system based on modular neural  networks and multi-feature texture analysis that will facilitate the automated interpretation of cloud images.  This will speed up the  interpretation process and provide continuity in the application of  satellite imagery for weather forecasting.  A series of infrared  satellite images from the Geostationary satellite METEOSAT7 were  employed in this research.  Nine different texture feature sets (a  total of 55 features) were extracted from the segmented cloud images using the following algorithms: first order statistics, spatial gray level dependence matrices, gray level difference statistics,  neighborhood gray tone difference matrix, statistical feature  matrix, Laws texture energy measures, fractals, and Fourier power  spectrum The neural network SOFM classifier and the statistical KNN  classifier were used for the classification of the cloud images.   Furthermore, the classification results of the different feature  sets were combined improving the classification yield to 91%.  15  Refs.

Title: Adaptive edge enhancement in SAR images. Training on the data vs.  training on simulated data
Abstract: Edge detection and edge enhancement in SAR images is, due to the  speckle effect, not so easily achieved.  Here we consider edge  enhancement as classification problem, i.e. we segment an image in  several edge classes and a no edge class.  Thus supervised  classification techniques become available.  We proposed an  artificial neural network approach and interpret the output as  'grade of being an edge pixel'.  For training of the network we  applied two training strategies: 1. Selection of training samples  from the data in a supervised way and 2. Artificial creation of  training samples based on speckle statistics using a speckle  simulation algorithm.  Both strategies are applied on a data set  acquired by DLR's E-SAR in L-Band.  The outputs of the edge  enhancement process are compared among each other and with RoA edge  detector.  6 Refs.

Title: Support vector machines and the multiple hypothesis test problem
Abstract: Two enhancements are proposed to the application and theory of  support vector machines.  The first is a method of multicategory  classification based on the binary classification version of the  support vector machine (SVM).  The method, which is called the M-ary  SVM, represents each category in binary format, and to each bit of  that representation is assigned a conventional SVM.  This approach  requires only [log//2(K)] SVMs, where K is  the number of classes.  We give an example of classification on an  octaphase-shift-keying (8-PSK) pattern space to illustrate main  concepts.  The second enhancement is that of adding equality  constraints to the conventional binary classification SVM.  This  allows pinning the classification boundary to points that are known  a priori to lie on the boundary.  Applications of this method often  arise in problems having some type of symmetry.  We present one such  example where the M-ary SVM is used to classify symbols of a  two-user, multiuser detection pattern space.  33 Refs.

Title: Automated detection of subpixel hyperspectral targets with continuous and discrete wavelet transforms
Abstract: A major step toward the use of hyperspectral sensors to detect  subpixel targets is the ability to detect constituent absorption  bands within a pixel's hyperspectral curve.  This paper introduces  the use of multiresolution analysis, specifically wavelet  transforms, for the automated detection of low amplitude and  overlapping constituent bands in hyperspectral curves.  The wavelet  approach is evaluated by incorporating it into an automated  statistical classification system, where wavelet coefficients'  scalar energies are used as features, linear discriminant analysis  is used for feature reduction, and maximum likelihood (ML) decisions are used for classification.  The system is tested using the  leave-one-out procedure on a database of 1000 HYDICE signals where  half contain a subpixel target or additive Gaussian absorption band.  Test results show that the continuous and discrete wavelet  transforms are extremely powerful tools in the detection of  constituent bands, even when the amplitude of the band is only 1% of the amplitude of the background signal.  18 Refs.

Title: A recurrent neural network classifier for improved retrievals of  areal extent of snow cover
Abstract: Accurate detection of areal extent of snow in mountainous regions is  important.  Areal extent of snow is a useful climatic indicator.   Moreover, snow melt is a major source of water supply for many arid  regions (e.g., western United States, Morocco) and affects regional  ecosystems.  Unfortunately, accurate satellite retrievals of areal  extent of snow have been difficult to achieve.  Two approaches to  effectively and accurately detect clear land, cloud, and areal  extent of snow in satellite data are developed.  A feed-forward  neural network (FFNN) is used to classify individual images, and a  recurrent NN is used to classify sequences of images.  The continuous outputs of the NN, combined with a linear mixing model, provide  support for mixed-pixel classification.  Validation with independent  in situ data confirms the classification accuracy (94% for  feed-forward NN, 97% for recurrent NN).  The combination of rapid  temporal sampling (e.g., GOES) and a recurrent NN classifier is  recommended (relative to an isolated scene (e.g., AVHRR) and a  feed-forward NN classifier).  45 Refs.

Title: A novel approach to the classification of the transient phenomena in  power transformers using combined wavelet transform and neural  network
Abstract: The wavelet transform is a powerful tool in the analysis of the power transformer transient phenomena because of its ability to extract  information from the transient signals simultaneously in both the  time and frequency domain.  This paper presents a novel technique for accurate discrimination between an internal fault and a magnetizing  inrush current in the power transformer by combining wavelet  transforms with neural networks.  The wavelet transform is firstly  applied to decompose the differential current signals of the power  transformer into a series of detailed wavelet components.  The  spectral energies of the wavelet components are calculated and then  employed to train a neural network to discriminate an internal fault from the magnetizing inrush current.  The simulated results presented clearly show that the proposed technique can accurately discriminate between an internal fault and a magnetizing inrush current in power  transformer protection.  13 Refs.

Title: A combination fingerprint classifier
Abstract: Fingerprint classification is an important indexing method for any  large scale fingerprint recognition system or database as a method  for reducing the number of fingerprints that need to be searched  when looking for a matching print.  Fingerprints are generally  classified into broad categories based on global characteristics.   This paper describes novel methods of classification using hidden  Markov models (HMMs) and decision trees to recognize the ridge  structure of the print, without needing to detect singular points.   The methods are compared and combined with a standard fingerprint  classification algorithm and results for the combination are  presented using a standard database of fingerprint images.  The paper also describes a method for achieving any level of accuracy required of the system by sacrificing the efficiency of the classifier.  The  accuracy of the combination classifier is shown to be higher than  that of two state-of-the-art systems tested under the same  conditions.  29 Refs.

Title: Three-dimensional object classification using shadow moire and neural network
Abstract: A method of recognizing and classifying 3-D shapes with continuous  surfaces by integrating shadow moire technique and neural network is presented.  Unlike existing methods of 3-D shape recognition that use range images of polyhedral objects or objects of different  geometries such as cones, rods, spheres, etc., the proposed method  classifies continuous surfaces that are geometrically similar.  The  objects selected to test the classification method are eggs of four  different grades.  The shadow moire technique, which has greater  sensitivity compared to structured lighting or laser scanning, is  used to obtain moire patterns on the surface of the eggs.  From the  moire pattern images 14 parameters are extracted and used as input  to a multilayer feedforward neural network.  The results of the  classification using the neural network show that the prediction  accuracy attainable is 60% when classification is performed on all  four grades.  The accuracy increased to 95% when three of the grades  are classified. copy 2001 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation  Engineers.  19 Refs.

Title: Scaled conjugate gradient and Bayesian training of neural networks  for fault identification in cylinders
Abstract: This paper compares Bayesian training of neural networks using hybrid Monte Carlo to scaled conjugate gradient method for fault  identification in cylinders using vibration data.  From the measured  data pseudo-modal energies and modal properties are calculated and  the coordinate pseudo-modal energy assurance criterion (COMEAC) and  the coordinate modal assurance criterion (COMAC) are computed  respectively.  The pseudo-modal energies, modal properties, COMEAC  and COMAC are used to train four neural networks.  On average, the  pseudo-modal-energy-networks are more accurate than the  modal-property-networks.  The weighted averages of the  pseudo-modal-energy- and modal-property-networks form a committee of networks.  The committee method gives lower mean squared errors and  better classification of faults than the individual methods.  The  Bayesian training is found to be more accurate and computationally  expensive than the scaled conjugate gradient method and to give  confidence levels. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: Extension of environmental parameters over the land surface by  improved fuzzy classification of remotely sensed data
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that useful information can be derived from remotely sensed data to extend local environmental measurements over the land surface.  A flexible fuzzy classification approach, in  particular, was demonstrated to be superior to conventional  multivariate regression methods for this purpose.  This new extension methodology is described and discussed in detail.  Next, some  modifications are proposed in order to improve the consideration of  the spectral information and to produce per-pixel estimates of the  error committed.  The performances of the original and modified  methodologies are then evaluated in two case studies representative  of different parameters to extend and satellite data.  The results  show the efficiency of the new strategy and, in particular, some  improvements obtained by the modified method which testify to the  effectiveness of the modifications proposed.  26 Refs.

Title: Establishing snowmelt runoff simulating model using remote sensing  data and GIS in the west of China
Abstract: Supported by Geographical Information Systems (GIS), snowmelt runoff  simulation models have been built for the large-scale basin in the  west of China.  Digital Terrain Factors (DTF) were employed for  dividing the basin.  Using image-processing software, the problems of image correction and match between the satellite image and the  images transformed from vector files have been resolved.  Meanwhile,  the thresholds of snow-pixel in images were achieved by means of a  trial-and-error iterative process.  Supervising classification  techniques were utilized to determine the percentage of snow cover  area in different zones and in the whole basin.  The experimental  watershed of the Qushenan (5286 km**2), in the upper reaches of the  Yellow River was selected as a test basin.  Snowmelt run-off models  were developed for each sub-basin from which three vertical zones  were simulated separately.  The snowmelt runoff was computed by  weighting coefficients.  The results show that this approach is  significant and practical.  9 Refs.

Title: Adsorption of tributyl phosphate on silica gel
Abstract: The adsorption behaviour of tributyl phosphate (TBP) on silica gel  was studied.  It was found that the adsorption isotherm shapes were  complicated, being considered as S- and L-type isotherms according  to the Giles classification.  Adsorption itself was polymolecular and of a physical nature, the first adsorptive layer involving hydrogen  bonding between the protons of surface silanol groups and the  electron-donating oxygen atom of the adsorbate molecule.  Subsequent  adsorption layers were formed via van der Waals interaction.  The  free energy of adsorption of the system lay between -22.1 kJ/mol and -23.8 kJ/mol.  The enthalpy change was negative and very small. i.e.   -6.3 kJ/mol, while the entropy change was positive and in the range  53.9 J/(mol K) to 55.4 J/(mol K).  The increase in entropy was  explained in terms of the mobility of the TBP molecules in the  adsorptive layer arising from their replacement on the silica gel  surface by water molecules derived from the aqueous medium.  11 Refs.

Title: Detection of parasites in cod fillets by using SIMCA classification  in multispectral images in the visible and NIR region
Abstract: The presence of parasitic nematodes in fillets of commercially  important fish species has been a serious quality problem for the  fishing industry for several decades.  Various approaches have been  tried to develop an efficient method to detect the parasites, but so far the only reasonable solution is manual inspection and trimming  of each fish fillet on a candling table.  In this study we have  investigated how multispectral imaging in combination with SIMCA  classification can be used for automatic detection of parasites.  The results indicate that the spectral characteristics of nematodes  differ sufficiently from those of fish flesh to allow one to obtain  fairly good classifications.  The method is able to detect parasites  at depths down to about 6 mm into the fish muscle.  The method shows  promising results, but further studies are required to verify  feasibility for the fish industry.  18 Refs.

Title: Raman spectroscopy and genetic algorithms for the classification of  wood types
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy and pattern recognition techniques are used to  develop a potential method to characterize wood by type.  The test  data consists of 98 Raman spectra of temperature softwoods and  hardwoods, and Brazilian and Honduran tropical woods.  A genetic  algorithm (GA) is used to extract features (i.e., line intensities  at specific wavelengths) characteristic of the Raman profile of each wood-type.  The spectral features identified by the pattern  recognition GA allow the wood samples to cluster by type in a plot  of the two largest principal components of the data.  Because  principal components maximize variance, the bulk of the information  encoded by these spectral features is about differences between wood types.  The predictive ability of the descriptors identified by the  pattern recognition GA and the principal component map associated  with them is validated using an external prediction set consisting  of tropical woods and temperate hard and softwoods.  22 Refs.

The ambiguity function, which is the  2-D inverse Fourier transform of the Wigner time-frequency  distribution of the signal, is utilized to remove the unknown time  and frequency shifts.  An ambiguity domain template is then generated from labeled training data (tens of observations), and  classification is performed using an inner product.  The method is  tested on synthetic transient signals in Gaussian noise and performs as well as or better than another recently proposed time-frequency  based method, and an energy detector, particularly when limited  training data are available. copy 2001 The Franklin Institute.

Title: Artificial intelligence methods for selection of an optimized sensor  array for identification of volatile organic compounds
Abstract: We have investigated two artificial intelligence (AI)-based  approaches for the optimum selection of a sensor array for the  identification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  The array  consists of quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs), each coated with a  different polymeric material.  The first approach uses a decision  tree classification algorithm to determine the minimum number of  features that are required to classify the training data correctly.   The second approach employs the hill-climb search algorithm to  search the feature space for the optimal minimum feature set that  maximizes the performance of a neural network classifier.  We also  examined the value of simple statistical procedures that could be  integrated into the search algorithm in order to reduce computation  time.  The strengths and limitations of each approach are discussed.   copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  46 Refs.

Title: Rule extraction from expert heuristics: A comparative study of rough  sets with neural networks and ID3
Abstract: The rule extraction capability of neural networks is an issue of  interest to many researchers.  Even though neural networks offer high accuracy in classification and prediction, there are criticisms on  the complicated and non-linear transformation performed in the  hidden layers.  It is difficult to explain the relationships between  inputs and outputs and derive simple rules governing the  relationships between them.  As alternatives, some researchers  recommend the use of rough sets or ID3 for rule extraction.  This  paper reviews and compares the rule extraction capabilities of rough sets with neural networks and ID3.  We apply the methods to analyze  expert heuristic judgments.  Strengths and weaknesses of the methods  are compared, and implications for the use of the methods are  suggested. copy 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  69  Refs.

Title: Wet centrifugal classification of calcite fines - Effect of feed size
Abstract: The wet classification of various fine calcite materials ( less than  8, less than 12 and less than 45 mum) by a disk-stack nozzle  centrifuge is presented and the results are discussed with respect  to feed size.  It has been found that the influences of  disk-geometry, G-force and feed rate on the classification  performance are not related to feed size.  However, the selection of  a split suitable for an efficient separation depends on the particle size distribution of the feed material.  Feed size has an impact on  the residence time of particle separation.  The results showed that  an optimum efficiency can be achieved when a calcite material with a particle size below 12 mum is treated.  An excessive amount of fine  or coarse calcite particles in the feed affects the efficiency of  the classification in the centrifuge.  It is also indicated that an  effective classification of calcite fines requires a moderate  G-force and high flow rates through a disk section bound by stud  spacers in the centrifuge.  19 Refs.

Title: Classification of characteristic words of electronic newspaper based  on the directed relation
Abstract: Newspaper articles are gradually opened to Web system.  But the  categories of articles are remained in conventional category types.   So users of these system have to consider the appropriate searching  keywords and categories when they search some articles.  In this  paper, we propose the new classification method for the  characteristic words based on directed relation.  We think this  classification can change categories of articles and accessing  keywords of users.  First, we introduce the word vector and directed  relation degree.  Second, we define the classification method,  reference degree and abstraction method of cluster.  Finally, we  experimented using one month data and can get the following results.  (1)Both directional tightly connected words are suitable base words  of clusters of articles.  (2)Level-0 abstraction method can draw the  rough border of clusters.  (3)One directional tightly connected words represent the main general words or proper words.  2 Refs.

Title: Pattern recognition using elemental composition for analytical  methodology decision making in atomic spectroscopy
Abstract: Three main classification methods, kNN, Bayesian, and C4.5 inductive  learning were investigated for their ability to differentiate types  of either aluminium or steel alloys.  Simulation experiments were  performed with two generated test data sets to evaluate their  potential for classifying samples based on elemental compositions.   The first test Set had normally distributed errors of 25% RSD.  This  data set simulated results of a preliminary scan of  semi-quantitative accuracy to be used for selection of a calibration methodology.  The second test set had 5% RSD and simulated results of a quantitative analysis, where the identity of the sample was to be  determined (identification).  The Bayesian method provided the best  results with prediction accuracy rates of 89.8% for the first goal  (methodology selection) and 100% for the second (identification) in  Al alloys.  Steel alloys were also classified best with the Bayesian  method, with 96.7% and 100% accuracy, respectively.  A detailed flow  chart for sample recognition is proposed, which optimizes both  prediction accuracy and calculation speed.  24 Refs.

Title: Orthogonal subspace projection-based approaches to classification of  MR image sequences
Abstract: Orthogonal subspace projection (OSP) approach has shown success in  hyperspectral image classification.  Recently, the feasibility of  applying OSP to multispectral image classification was also  demonstrated via SPOT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terra) and Landsat (Land Satellite) images.  Since an MR (magnetic resonance)  image sequence is also acquired by multiple spectral channels  (bands), this paper presents a new application of OSP in MR image  classification.  The idea is to model an MR image pixel in the  sequence as a linear mixture of substances (such as white matter,  gray matter, cerebral spinal fluid) of interest from which each of  these substances can be classified by a specific subspace projection operator followed by a desired matched filter.  The experimental  results show that OSP provides a promising alternative to existing  MR image classification techniques. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.   All rights reserved.  34 Refs.

Title: Chemical reaction and Co-60 retardation in unsteady, unsaturated soil water flow: The effect of clay content
Abstract: The ability of the regolith to adsorb and retard radioactive and  other noxious chemicals is important when selecting repository  sites.  Because of its surface charge and great specific surface, the clay in soil contributes significantly to this retardation.  This  paper illustrates a novel analysis of unsteady water and solute flow in unsaturated soil that quantifies these effects.  Analysis and  experiments suggest that the use of a clay-based space-like  coordinate permits us to generalise results to account for variation in clay content and soil structure across many materials.  Results  imply that clay content, mineralogy, and charge permit quantitative  material classification according to their ability to retard  cationic wastes.  The approach appears to offer significant economies in selecting materials where adsorption and retardation of cation  pollutants is desired.  22 Refs.

Title: Pattern recognition by combined invariants
Abstract: A feature-based recognition of objects or patterns independent of  their position, size, orientation and other variations has been the  goal of much recent research.  The existing approaches to invariant  two-dimensional pattern recognition are useless when pattern is  blurred.  In this paper, we present a novel pattern recognition  system which can solve the problem by using combined invariants as  image features.  The classification technique we choose for our  system is weighted normalized cross correlation.  The mean of the  intraclass standard deviations of the kth feature over the total  number of prototypes for each class is used as a weighting factor  during the classification process to improve recognition accuracy.   The feasibility of our pattern recognition system and the invariance of the combined features with respect to translation, scaling,  rotation and blurring are approved by numerical experiments on head  images.  13 Refs.

Title: Classification of materials using temperature response curve fitting  and fuzzy neural network
Abstract: This paper describes a system that can be used to classify an unknown material regardless of the change of ambient temperature using  temperature response curve fitting and fuzzy neural network (FNN).   There are some problems to realize the classification system using  temperature response.  It requires too many memories to store the  vast temperature response data and it has to be filtered to remove  noise which occurs in experiment.  And the temperature response is  influenced by the change of ambient temperature.  So, this paper  proposes a practical method using curve fitting to remove above  problems of memories and noise.  And FNN is proposed to overcome the  problem caused by the change of ambient temperature.  Using the FNN  which is learned by temperature responses on fixed ambient  temperature and known thermal conductivity (TC), the TC of the  material can be inferred on various ambient temperature.  So the  material can be classified by the TC. copy 2001 Elsevier Science  B.V.  All rights reserved.  6 Refs.

Title: Lagerung fester organischer peroxide: Entwicklung eines brandtests in kleinem massstab   Storage of solid organic peroxides - Development of a small scale  burning test
Abstract: Organic peroxides and higher concentrated formulations of them in  most cases higher burning rates than normal hydrocarbon compounds.   For the storage of peroxides the German BGV B4 (Occupational Safety  Rule) lays down safety distances to other stores and factory  buildings in dependence on the burning rate and on the mass of  substances in the peroxide store.  According to the burning rate an  organic peroxide has to be assigned to one of a series of storage  groups.  Until now, the burning rate for solid organic peroxides in  packagings is determined by carrying out large scale burning tests  with amounts of 25 to 250 kg according to the storage guideline for  the classification of dangerously explosive substances SprengLR 011.  Recent investigations with amounts of 2 to 20 kg show that the test  results allow an extrapolation from lower masses to storage amounts.  13 Refs.

Title: A segmentation-free recognition of handwritten touching numeral pairs using modular neural network
Abstract: The conventional approach to the recognition of handwritten touching  numeral pairs uses a process with two steps; splitting the touching  numerals and recognizing individual numerals.  It shows a limitation  mainly due to a large variation in touching styles between two  numerals.  In this paper, we adopt the segmentation-free approach,  which regards a touching numeral pair as an atomic pattern.  Two  important issues are raised, i.e. solving the large-set  classification and constructing a large-size training set.  For the  100-class classification, we use a modular neural network which  consists of 100 separate subnetworks.  We construct the training set  with a balance among 100 classes and using a sufficient amount by  extracting actual samples from a numeral database and synthesizing  samples with a scheme of forcing two numerals to touch.  The  experimental results show a promising performance.  20 Refs.

Title: ECG beat recognition using fuzzy hybrid neural network
Abstract: This paper presents the application of the fuzzy neural network for  electrocardiographic (ECG) beat recognition and classification.  The  new classification algorithm of the ECG beats, applying the fuzzy  hybrid neural network and the features drawn from the higher order  statistics has been proposed in the paper.  The cumulants of the  second, third, and fourth orders have been used for the feature  selection.  The hybrid fuzzy neural network applied in the solution  consists of the fuzzy self-organizing subnetwork connected in  cascade with the multilayer perceptron, working as the final  classifier.  The c-means and Gustafson-Kessel algorithms for the  self-organization of the neural network have been applied.  The  results of experiments of recognition of different types of beats on the basis of the ECG waveforms have confirmed good efficiency of the proposed solution.  The investigations show that the method may find  practical application in the recognition and classification of  different type heart beats.  17 Refs.

Title: Scalable packet classification
Abstract: Packet classification is important for applications such as  firewalls, intrusion detection, and differentiated services.   Existing algorithms for packet classification reported in the  literature scale poorly in either time or space as filter databases  grow in size.  Hardware solutions such as TCAMs do not scale to large classifiers.  However, even for large classifiers (say 100,000  rules), any packet is likely to match a few (say 10) rules.  Our  paper seeks to exploit this observation to produce a scalable packet classification scheme called Aggregated Bit Vector (ABV).  Our paper  takes the bit vector search algorithm (BV) described in [11] (which takes linear time) and adds two new ideas,  recursive aggregation of bit maps and filter rearrangement, to  create ABV (which can take logarithmic time of may databases).  We  show the ABV outperforms BV by an order of magnitude using  simulations on both industrial firewall databases and synthetically  generated databases.  17 Refs.

Title: Temporal updating scheme for probabilistic neural network with  application to satellite cloud classification-further results
Abstract: A novel temporal updating approach for probabilistic neural network  (PNN) classifiers was developed [1] to  account for temporal changes of spectral and temperature features of clouds in the visible and infrared (IR) GOES 8 (Geostationary  Operational Environmental Satellite) imagery data.  In this brief  paper, a new method referred to as moving singular value  decomposition (MSVD) is introduced to improve the classification  rate of the boundary blocks or blocks containing cloud types with  nonuniform texture.  The MSVD method is then incorporated into the  temporal updating scheme and its effectiveness is demonstrated on  several sequences of GOES 8 cloud imagery data.  These results  indicate that the incorporation of the new MSVD improves the overall performance of the temporal updating process by almost 10%.  15 Refs.

Title: Classification of noisy signals using fuzzy ARTMAP neural networks
Abstract: This paper describes an approach to classification of noisy signals  using a technique based on the fuzzy ARTMAP neural network (FAMNN).   The proposed method is a modification of the testing phase of the  fuzzy ARTMAP that exhibits superior generalization performance  compared to the generalization performance of the standard fuzzy  ARTMAP in the presence of noise.  An application to textured  grayscale image segmentation is presented.  The superiority of the  proposed modification over the standard fuzzy ARTMAP is established  by a number of experiments using various texture sets, feature  vectors and noise types.  The texture sets include various aerial  photos and also samples obtained from the Brodatz album.   Furthermore, the classification performance of the standard and the  modified fuzzy ARTMAP is compared for different network sizes.   Classification results that illustrate the performance of the  modified algorithm and the FAMNN are presented.  27 Refs.

Title: Methodology development for wetland restoration planning based on  topography and soil hydrology
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for the identification of  suitable wetland restoration sites at a regional scale, using  readily available soil and topographic data.  The study focuses on  Rhos pasture, a floristically diverse wet grassland community, which has been under threat from agricultural improvement in the past and  more recently from neglect.  The HOST classification was used to  describe soil hydrological properties and topography was expressed  using the In(a/tanbeta) topographic index.  Distributions of soil  hydrology and the topographic index under Rhos pasture sites were  compared to the distributions of the total area and significance of  the differences was assessed with chi-squared tests.  Results were  integrated into a decision support system, which predicted 72% of  the existing sites.  The method provides a useful tool for  restoration planning at the decision-making scale.  12 Refs.

Title: Pattern classification using multiple hierarchical overlapped  self-organising maps
Abstract: In this paper, we describe techniques for designing high-performance  pattern classification systems using multiple hierarchical  overlapped self-organising maps (HOSOM) (Suganthan, Proceedings of  the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, WCCI'98,  Alaska, 1998).  The HOSOM model has one first level SOM and several  partially overlapping second-level SOMs.  With this overlap, every  training and test sample is classified by multiple second-level  SOMs.  Hence, the final classification decision can be made by  combining these multiple classification decisions to obtain a better performance.  In this paper, we use multiple HOSOMs and each HOSOM is trained on a distinct input feature set extracted from the same data set.  Since one HOSOM yields multiple classifications, these multiple HOSOMs generate a large number of classification decisions.  To  combine the individual classifications, we make use of the global  winner as well as a winner for every class.  Our experiments yielded  a high recognition rate of 99.25% on NIST 19 numeral database. copy  2001 Pattern Recognition Society.  Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  16 Refs.

Title: Application of fuzzy logic to vehicle classification algorithm in  loop/piezo-sensor fusion systems
Abstract: Individual vehicle information, especially, vehicle classification  data plays a key role in an advanced traffic management and  information systems (ATMIS).  In inductive loop and piezo-sensor  fusion systems, traffic data such as the vehicle length and the  distance between axles are used for vehicle classification.  However, classification errors often occur in distinguishing passenger cars  from small trucks and in distinguishing medium-sized trucks from  small trucks.  It is mainly attributed to the fact that they are  similar in lengths and have similar inter-axle distances.  To improve the performance in vehicle classification, a new algorithm is  developed using a fuzzy logic.  Vehicle weight and speed are used as  the inputs to the fuzzy logic block.  The output of the fuzzy logic  block is a weighting factor to modify the calculated vehicle length.  Experimental results show that the developed algorithm significantly improves the classification performance.  (Edited abstract) 17 Refs.

Title: Writing a user requirement specification
Abstract: The URS is the foundation of an automation project and must support  the design, testing, installation and operation of a control and  automation system throughout its life cycle.  However, an ambiguous  URS is worse than an incomplete URS and quite often it is left to  the supplier to resolve uncertain or missing issues that can result  in additional costs and/or functionality that is not required or  intended.  It is the responsibility of the user to define what is  required of an automation system, but this must address att possible operating scenarios, desirable and undesirable.  There is no reason  why, with appropriate resources, the user cannot develop a document  that clearly, concisely and consistently specifies the operational  requirements of an automation system and ensure that configuration,  testing and commissioning are right first time and achieved within  timescale and budget.  2 Refs.

Title: Neural fuzzy analysis of delaminated composites from shearography  imaging
Abstract: The use of shearography for impact damage detection and  characterization is often difficult to achieve in laminated  composites due to lack of a formation of clear fringe patterns as in the case of delaminations.  Furthermore, existing techniques for  interpreting shearograms are often inadequate for impact damage  assessment in composite materials.  In this paper, a technique is  reported that combines conventional image analysis with neural  networks (NNs) classification and fuzzy logic inference to  characterize shearograms.  The objective is to train an automated  system for recognition of pertinent characteristics and features  from shearograms of composites damaged by impact.  The results  demonstrate the potential of the NN-based shearography technique in  characterizing damage in laminated composites.  Its applicability to  structural health monitoring is also discussed. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  6 Refs.

Title: Personalizing video recorders using multimedia processing and  integration
Abstract: Current personal Video recorders make it very easy for consumers to  record whole TV programs.  Our research however, focuses on  personalizing TV at a sub-program level.  We use a traditional  Content-Based Information Retrieval system architecture consisting  of archiving and retrieval modules.  The archiving module employs a  three-layered, multimodal integration framework to segment, analyze, characterize, and classify segments.  The retrieval module relies on  users' personal preferences to deliver both full programs and video  segments of interest.  We tested retrieval concepts with real users  and discovered that they see more value in segmenting non-narrative  programs (e.g. news) than narrative programs (e.g. movies).  We  benchmarked individual algorithms and segment classification for  celebrity and financial segments as instances of non-narrative  content.  For celebrity segments we obtained a total precision of  94.1% and recall of 85.7%, and for financial segments a total  precision of 81.1% and a recall of 86.9%.  7 Refs.

Title: On clustering and retrieval of video shots
Abstract: Clustering of video data is an important issue in video abstraction,  browsing and retrieval.  In this paper, we propose a two-level  hierarchical clustering approach by aggregating shots with similar  motion and color features.  Motion features are computed directly  from 2D tensor histograms, while color features are represented by  3D color histograms.  Cluster validity analysis is further applied to automatically determine the number of clusters at each level.  Video  retrieval can then be done directly based on the result of  clustering.  The proposed approach is found to be useful particularly for sports games, where motion and color are important visual cues  when searching and browsing the desired video shots.  Since most  games involve two teams, classification and retrieval of teams  becomes an interesting topic.  To achieve these goals, nevertheless,  an initial as well as critical step is to isolate team players from  background regions.  Thus, we also introduce approach to segment  foreground objects (players) prior to classification and retrieval.   8 Refs.

Title: Symbolic structural synthesis and a description method for planar  kinematic chains in robotics
Abstract: A new method for structural synthesis of planar link chains in  robotics is presented.  It is based on the notion of logical  equations associating Modular Structural Groups (MSGs) and closed  chains.  After a brief reminder of the theory MSGs, and of  connectivity and mobility laws, various levels of abstraction are  studied concerning the structural number.  This permits the synthesis of planar chains with various degrees of complexity.  The logical  equation notion is introduced.  It permits the association of MSG of  type A and closed chains of type G. A method for the description of  chains by contours and molecules is also proposed.  It permits the  classification of topological robot structures taking into account  their complexity expressed by the number of closed loops in their  molecules.  This method is applied for the description of chains thus obtained, and for the description of the main structure of  industrial robots with closed planar chains.  40 Refs.

Abstract: Kleinberg's HITS algorithm, a method of link analysis, uses the link  structure of a network of webpages to assign authority and hub  weights to each page.  These weights are used to rank sources on a  particular topic.  We have found that certain tree-like web  structures can lead the HITS algorithm to return either arbitrary or non-intuitive results.  We give a characterization of these web  structures.  We present two modifications to the adjacency matrix  input to the HITS algorithm.  Exponentiated Input, our first  modification, includes information not only on direct links but also on longer paths between pages.  It resolves both limitations  mentioned above.  Usage Weighted Input, our second modification,  weights links according to how often they were followed by users in  a given time period; it incorporates user feedback without requiring direct user querying.  4 Refs.

Title: Multiscale image segmentation using wavelet-domain hidden Markov  models
Abstract: We introduce a new image texture segmentation algorithm, HMTseg,  based on wavelets and the hidden Markov tree (HMT) model.  The HMT is a tree-structured probabilistic graph that captures the statistical  properties of the coefficients of the wavelet transform.  Since the  HMT is particularly well suited to images containing singularities  (edges and ridges), it provides a good classifier for distinguishing between textures.  Utilizing the inherent tree structure of the  wavelet HMT and its fast training and likelihood computation  algorithms, we perform texture classification at a range of  different scales.  We then fuse these multiscale classifications  using a Bayesian probabilistic graph to obtain reliable final  segmentations.  Since HMTseg works on the wavelet transform of the  image, it can directly segment wavelet-compressed images without the need for decompression into the space domain.  We demonstrate the  performance of HMTseg with synthetic, aerial photo, and document  image segmentations.  37 Refs.

Title: A spatial density analysis technique for the automatic classification of 4pi detector data
Abstract: In nuclear physics at intermediate energies, the use of multidetector arrays consisting of thousands of detectors is customary.  This paper presents a novel approach to the automatic classification of data  collected by the 4pi detector CHIMERA, constituted by 1192  telescopes of a thin silicon transparent detector coupled to a thick CsI(Tl) scintillator.  The method is based on spatial density data  processing and produces frequency distributions of the most  significant physical parameters.  These one-dimensional spectra can  be more easily analyzed than the standard two-dimensional scatter  plots.  With respect to manual or semiautomatic procedures, presently used for data analysis, our method offers the advantages of drastic  time reduction and unbiased criteria for cluster identification.  The proposed method can be successfully used in both off-line data  analysis and multidetector stability control.  15 Refs.

Title: An improved automatic isotropic color edge detection technique
Abstract: In many image processing applications, edge detection is a useful  method for obtaining a simplified image that preserves the domain  geometric structures and spatial relationships among variant image  components.  For providing automatic edge detection, two problems  should be solved: one is feature extraction for calculating the edge strength, another is feature classification for automatic edge  detection.  For solving these two problems, we propose an improved  automatic edge detection technique.  Three color components of a  color image and more potential edge patterns are integrated for  solving the feature extraction problem.  A fast entropic thresholding technique is also developed for solving the feature classification  problem.  Experimental results have confirmed that this proposed edge detector can provide more reasonable results as compared with the  traditional isotropic edge operators, and its calculation cost has  been reduced as compared with the complex edge detectors.  Good  balance between the calculation cost and the edge detection accuracy is achieved. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  38 Refs.

Title: SVM-based detection of moving vehicles for automatic traffic  monitoring
Abstract: A traffic surveillant system must be capable of working in all kinds  of weather and illumination conditions, such as shadows in a sunny  day, vehicle reflections in a rainy day and vehicle headlights in  the evening.  In this paper we propose a robust algorithm to detect  real moving vehicles and eliminate the influence of shadows and  vehicle headlights by using a pattern classification method.  On  account of its simple but efficient representation, the histogram of a difference image is used as the features for classification.  The  classifier is designed based on support vector machine (SVM) due to  its high generalization performance.  The final experiment shows that the real traffic monitoring system based on our algorithm can detect moving vehicles and separate shadows and headlights robustly and  effectively in different weather and illumination conditions.  6  Refs.

Title: Mobile detection of traffic infrastructure
Abstract: This work presents a mobile mapping system that aims at automatic  detection of traffic infrastructure from image sequences.  The visual information will be georeferenced with GPS/INS information to  represent a most realistic model of the environment in a GIS  database.  The integration of innovative methods such as vertical  structure segmentation and probabilistic object matching provides a  qualified framework for the detection of arbitrary traffic  infrastructure.  The detection of infrastructure starts with a  segmentation of the video frame into regions of interest by  exploiting track localization and a-priori knowledge about the  visual scene.  A further step concerns the extraction of 3D structure and the segmentation of its associated distance map w.r.t.   vertically accentuated objects.  Color information derived from  learned classification filters contributes to a characterization of  class-specific support regions for further processing.  Eventually,  traffic signs and lights are robustly identified by probabilistic  matching using a RBF neural network that was trained from real  imagery of traffic infrastructure.  16 Refs.

Title: Edge classification of color images based on psychophysical codebook  construction
Abstract: Edges are of fundamental importance in the analysis of images, and of course in the field of image quality.  To incorporate the edge  information as coded by the Human Visual System (HVS) in a vector  quantization scheme, we have developed a classification strategy to  separate edge vectors from non-edge vectors.  This strategy allows  the generation of different sets of codewords of different size for  each kind of vectors.  For each one of the "edge" sets, the final  size is perceptually tuned.  Finally, when an image is encoded, its  associated edge map is generated.  Then the selection of the  appropriate "edge" set is made in respect with the edge amount  present in the image.  Then the second set of non-edge vectors is  performed in order to respect the required compression rate.   Statistical measure and psychophysical experiments have been  performed to judge the quality of reconstructed images.  9 Refs.

Title: Analysis of the westland data set
Abstract: The "Westland" set of empirical accelerometer helicopter data with  seeded and labeled faults is analyzed with the aim of condition  monitoring.  The autoregressive (AR) coefficients from a simple  linear model encapsulate a great deal of information in a relatively few measurements; and it has also been found that augmentation of  these by harmonic and other parameters can improve classification  significantly.  Several techniques have been explored, among these  restricted Coulomb energy (RCE) networks, learning vector  quantization (LVQ), Gaussian mixture classifiers and decision trees.  A problem with these approaches, and in common with many  classification paradigms, is that augmentation of the feature  dimension can degrade classification ability.  Thus, we also  introduce the Bayesian data reduction algorithm (BDRA), which  imposes a Dirichlet prior on training data and is thus able to  quantify probability of error in an exact manner, such that features may be discarded or coarsened appropriately.  13 Refs.

Title: Development of a neuro-fuzzy expert system for predictive maintenance
Abstract: In this paper, a method for automatic constructing a fuzzy expert  system from numerical data using the ILFN network and the Genetic  Algorithm is presented.  The Incremental Learning Fuzzy Neural (ILFN) network was developed for pattern classification applications.  The  ILFN network, employed fuzzy sets and neural network theory, is a  fast, one-pass, on-line, and incremental learning algorithm.  After  trained, the ILFN network stored numerical knowledge in hidden  units, which can then be directly mapped into if-then rule bases.  A  knowledge base for fuzzy expert systems can then be extracted from  the hidden units of the ILFN classifier.  A genetic algorithm is then invoked, in an iterative manner, to reduce number of roles and  select only important features of input patterns needed to provide  to a fuzzy rule-based system.  Three computer simulations using the  Wisconsin breast cancer data set were performed.  Using 400 patterns  for training and 299 patterns for testing, the derived fuzzy expert  system achieved 99.5% and 98.33% correct classification on the  training set and the test set, respectively.  26 Refs.

Title: Incomplete information tables and rough classification
Abstract: The rough set theory, based on the original definition of the  indiscernibility relation, is not useful for analysing incomplete  information tables where some values of attributes are unknown.  In  this paper we distinguish two different semantics for incomplete  information: the "missing value" semantics and the "absent value"  semantics.  The already known approaches, e.g. based on the tolerance relations, deal with the missing value case.  We introduce two  generalisations of the rough sets theory to handle these situations.  The first generalisation introduces the use of a non symmetric  similarity relation in order to formalise the idea of absent value  semantics.  The second proposal is based on the use of valued  tolerance relations.  A logical analysis and the computational  experiments show that for the valued tolerance approach it is  possible to obtain more informative approximations and decision  rules than using the approach based on the simple tolerance  relation.  27 Refs.

Title: Rule quality measures for rule induction systems: Description and  evaluation
Abstract: A rule quality measure is important to a rule induction system for  determining when to stop generalization or specialization.  Such  measures are also important to a rule-based classification procedure for resolving conflicts among rules.  We describe a number of  statistical and empirical rule quality formulas and present an  experimental comparison of these formulas on a number of standard  machine learning datasets.  We also present a meta-learning method  for generating a set of formula-behaviour rules from the  experimental results which show the relationships between a  formula's performance and the characteristics of a dataset.  These  formula-behaviour rules are combined into formula-selection rules  that can be used in a rule induction system to select a rule quality formula before rule induction.  We will report the experimental  results showing the effects of formula-selection on the predictive  performance of a rule induction system.  20 Refs.

Title: Interpretation of forest harvest conditions in New Brunswick using  Landsat TM enhanced wetness difference imagery (EWDI)
Abstract: Clearcut, partial harvest, and silvicultural forest stand conditions  in New Brunswick over a one-year period (1997-1998) are described  with the visual interpretation of differences in Tasseled Cap  transformation of two Landsat Thematic Mapper images.  An enhanced  wetness difference image (EWDI) display was used to create examples  of changes that were related to known change conditions on the  ground; we interpreted distinctive patterns in the normal colour  composites and the EWDI associated with clearcutting, shelterwood  and seed tree harvesting, strip cutting and group selection cuts,  precommercial and commercial thinning.  Our interpretation suggests  that these forest stand treatments and the resulting spectral  patterns could be the basis for development of a classification  method or potentially an automated detection/monitoring system.  14  Refs.

Title: Robust speech recognition method based on discriminative environment  feature extraction
Abstract: It is an effective approach to learn the influence of environmental  parameters, such as additive noise and channel distortions, from  training data for robust speech recognition.  Most of the previous  methods are based on maximum likelihood estimation criterion.   However, these methods do not lead to a minimum error rate result.   In this paper, a novel discriminative learning method of  environmental parameters, which is based on Minimum Classification  Error (MCE) criterion, is proposed.  In the method, a simple  classifier and the Generalized Probabilistic Descent (GPD) algorithm are adopted to iteratively learn the environmental parameters.   Consequently, the clean speech features are estimated from the noisy speech features with the estimated environmental parameters, and  then the estimations of clean speech features are utilized in the  back-end HMM classifier.  Experiments show that the best error rate  reduction of 32.1% is obtained, tested on a task of 18 isolated  confusion Korean words, relative to a conventional HMM system.  12  Refs.

Title: Detecting multiple objects under partial occlusion by integrating  classification and tracking approaches
Abstract: A visual-based framework for detecting in real time multiple objects  in real outdoor scenes is presented.  The main novelty of the system  is its capability to reduce the problems of partial occlusions  and/or overlaps that occur very commonly in real scenes containing  multiple moving objects.  Overlaps and occlusions are dealt with by  integrating classification and tracking procedures into a  data-fusion distributed sensory network.  Neural tree-based networks  are applied to distinguish among isolated objects and groups of  objects on the image plane.  Extended Kalman filters are applied to  estimate the number of objects in the scene, their position, and the related motion parameters.  Experimental results on complex outdoor  scenes with multiple moving objects are presented. copy 2001 John  Wiley & Sons, Inc.  Int J Imaging Syst Technol.  27 Refs.

Title: Exploratory analysis of spatial data using interactive maps and data  mining
Abstract: We present new methods for analyzing geo-referenced statistical data.  These methods combine visualization and direct manipulation  techniques of exploratory data analysis and algorithms for data  mining.  The methods have been implemented by integrating two  hitherto separate software tools: Descartes for interactive thematic mapping, and the data mining toolbox Kepler.  In using these tools,  data analysis may proceed as a steady interaction between visual  inspiration and insights gained from mathematical-statistical  calculations.  After introducing the various components of the  methods and tools, the paper guides the reader through in-depth  examples of using the tools in the context of analysis of urban  demographic data.  In particular, it is shown how geography-based  classifications of urban districts can be related to available  thematic characteristics by applying the data mining algorithms  classification tree derivation, attribute weighting, and subgroup  discovery.  28 Refs.

Title: Hydrological modelling study with digital image processing of  multi-sensor satellite data over a small high mountainous catchment
Abstract: The integration of visible and infrared satellite remote sensing  information is made with ground meteorological and hydrological data to study the application of a semi-distributed temperature index  model over a small high mountainous catchment in the Italian Alps.   Nine sets of digital Landsat MSS and TM images covering a  hydrological year were processed.  Digital elevation model, slope,  aspect and shaded relief maps coinciding with the satellite passes  were generated using locally developed software known as Territorial Image Synthesis System (TISS).  The areal extent of snow cover over  the catchment for each scene has been estimated using  parallele-piped, nearest neighbour and maximum likelihood  methodologies of supervised classification.  Daily snow depletion  curves were developed and incorporated as input to the Snowmelt  Runoff Model (SRM), along with pre-determined catchment  morphological parameters.  The model performance evaluation has  indicated excellent results when compared to those obtained on other catchments of similar areal extent in different parts of the world.   9 Refs.

Title: The cluster-indexing method for case-based reasoning using  self-organizing maps and learning vector quantization for bond  rating cases
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid data mining model for the prediction of  corporate bond rating.  This model uses a new case-indexing method of case-based reasoning (CBR), which utilizes the cluster information  of financial data in order to improve classification accuracy.  This  method uses not only case-specific knowledge of past problems like  conventional CBR, but also uses additional knowledge derived from  the clusters of cases.  The cluster-indexing method assumes that  there are some distinct subgroups (clusters) in each rated group.   Competitive artificial neural networks are used to generate the  centroid values of clusters because these techniques produce better  adaptive clusters than statistical clustering algorithms.  The  experiments using corporate bond rating cases show that the  cluster-indexing CBR is superior to conventional CBR and inductive  learning-indexing CBR - a rival case indexing method. copy 2001  Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.  29 Refs.

Title: Correlation between electronic nose signals and fruit quality  indicators on shelf-life measurements with pinklady apples
Abstract: In this work, an electronic nose is used to assess the ripeness state of pinklady apples through their shelf-life.  In order to evaluate  the electronic nose performance, fruit quality indicators are also  obtained to compare results from both techniques.  Pinklady apples  were harvested at their optimal date so that electronic nose  measurements and fruit quality measurements could be performed on  the fruit samples during their ripening process.  A PCA analysis, a  well-known linear classification technique, does not show any  clustering behaviour that might be attributed to ripening.  On the  other hand, Fuzzy art, an unsupervised neural network classification algorithm, shows a tendency to classify measurements regarding to  their shelf-life period.  Finally, electronic nose signals are  correlated with classical fruit quality parameters such as firmness, starch index and acidity.  Good correlation coefficients are  obtained, a clear indication that electronic nose signals are  related to the ripening process of apples. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science B.V.

Title: Vision-based terrain characterization and traversability assessment
Abstract: This article presents novel techniques for real-time terrain  characterization and assessment of terrain traversability for a  field mobile robot using a vision system and artificial neural  networks.  The key terrain traversability characteristics are  identified as roughness, slope, discontinuity, and hardness.  These  characteristics are extracted from imagery data obtained from  cameras mounted on the robot and are represented in a fuzzy logic  framework using perceptual, linguistic fuzzy sets.  The approach  adopted is highly robust and tolerant to imprecision and uncertainty inherent in sensing and perception of natural environments.  The four traversability characteristics are combined to form a single Fuzzy  Traversability Index, which quantifies the ease-of-traversal of the  terrain by the mobile robot.  Experimental results are presented to  demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach for  classification of different terrain segments based on their  traversability.  12 Refs.

Title: Mineral identification using artificial neural networks and the  rotating polarizer stage
Abstract: An artificial neural network is used for the classification of  minerals.  Optical data using the rotating polarizing microscope  stage, which extracts a basic set of seven primary images during  each sampling.  A selected set of parameters based on hue,  saturation, intensity and texture measurements are extracted from  the segmented minerals within each data set.  Parameters such as  pleochroism, plane light hue, and gradient homogeneity were a few  that proved to yield class-discriminating properties.  Texture  parameters are shown to have the ability to classify colourless  minerals.  The neural network is trained on manually classified  mineral samples.  The most successful artificial network to date is a three-layer feed forward network using generalized delta error  correction.  The network uses 27 distinct input parameters to  classify 10 different minerals.  Testing the network on previously  unseen mineral samples yielded successful results as high as 93%.   copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  17 Refs.

Title: In-line reaction based on predictive yield-loss analysis
Abstract: In-line reaction to defect excursions is becoming critical to the  semiconductor fabs to achieve competitive advantages by maintaining  good learning curves.  Traditional reaction techniques are based on  the SPC methodology applied to process variables and data provided  by the inspection tools, like defect counts by layer or classified  defects (either manually or by ADC).  But all these techniques lack  from a fundamental information: the killing potential of the  variables under control.  Many times, "out of control" processes mean no yield loss, whereas small deviations in "in-control" processes  can cause severe damage.  We present a methodology to achieve in-line reaction based on combining predictive yield loss calculation for  the lots currently being processed and SPC methodology.  This  analysis method opens a new perspective for the in-line reaction  tools and provides a way to reduce dramatically the amount of yield  excursions.  4 Refs.

Title: The complexity of poor man's logic
Abstract: Motivated by description logics, we investigate what happens to the  complexity of modal satisfiability problems if we only allow  formulas built from literals, logical AND , diamond , and square  open .  Previously, the only known result was that the complexity of  the satisfiability problem for K drops from PSPACE-complete to  coNP-complete.  In this paper we show that not all modal logics  behave like K. In particular, we show that the complexity of the  satisfiability problem with respect to frames in which each world  has at least one successor drops from PSPACE-complete to P, but that in contrast the satisfiability problem with respect to the class of  frames in which each world has at most two successors remains  PSPACE-complete.  As a corollary of the latter result, we also solve  the open problem from the complexity classification of description  logics.  In the last section, we classify the complexity of the  satisfiability problem for K for all other restrictions on the set  of operators.  10 Refs.

Title: A new crossover operator and its application to artificial neural  networks evolution
Abstract: The design of artificial neural networks (ANNs) through simulated  evolution has been investigated for many years.  The use of genetic  algorithms (GAs) for such evolution suffers a prominent problem  known as the permutation problem or the competing convention  problem.  This paper proposes a new crossover operator, which we call the selected node crossover (SNX), to overcome the permutation  problem of GAs for evolving ANNs.  A GA-based evolutionary system  (GANet) using the SNX for evolving three layered feedforward ANNs  architecture with weight learning is described.  GANet uses one  crossover and one mutation operators sequentially.  If the first  operator is successful then the second operator is not applied.   GANet is less dependent on user-defined control parameters than the  conventional evolutionary methods.  GANet is applied to a variety of  benchmarks including large (26 class) to small (2 class)  classification problems.  The results show that GANet can produce  compact ANN architectures with small classification errors.  27 Refs.

Title: Multiple mixture segmental HMM and its applications
Abstract: In this paper a multiple mixture segmental hidden Markov model  (MMSHMM) is presented.  This model is extended from the linear  probabilistic-trajectory segmental HMM [1]  . Each segment is characterized by linear trajectory with slope and  mid-point parameters, and also the residual error covariances around the trajectory, so that both extra-segmental and intra-segmental  variation are represented.  Instead of modeling single distribution  for each model parameter as earlier work, we use multiple mixture  components for model parameters to represent the variability due to  the variation within each speaker and also the differences between  speakers.  This model is evaluated on two applications.  One is a  phonetic classification task with TIMIT corpus, which shows that  MMSHMM has advantages over conventional HMM.  Another one is a  speaker-independent keyword spotting task with the Road Rally  database.  By rescoring putative events hypothesized by a primary HMM keyword spotter, the experiments show that the performance is  improved through distinguishing true hits from false alarms.  12  Refs.

Title: Indicator variable dependent output probability modelling via  continuous posterior functions
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of inserting an additional hidden variable into a standard HMM.  It is shown that this can be done by  introducing a continuous feature which is used to calculate the  probability of observing the different states of the hidden  variable.  The posteriors are modelled by softmax functions with  polynomial exponents and an efficient method is developed for  reestimating their parameters.  After analysing a two dimensional  reestimation example on artificial data, the proposed HMM is  evaluated on the 1997 Broadcast News task with a particular focus on spontaneous speech.  To derive a good indicator variable for this  purpose, classification experiments are carried out on fast and slow classes of phones on the 1997 Broadcast News training data.  Finally, recognition experiments on the test set of this task show that the  proposed model gives an improvement over a standard HMM with a  comparable number of parameters.  5 Refs.

Title: Learning statistically efficient features for speaker recognition
Abstract: We apply independent component analysis (ICA) for extracting an  optimal basis to the problem of finding efficient features for a  speaker.  The basis functions learned by the algorithm are oriented  and localized in both space and frequency, bearing a resemblance to  Gabor functions.  The speech segments are assumed to be generated by  a linear combination of the basis functions, thus the distribution  of speech segments of a speaker is modeled by a basis, which is  calculated so that each component should be independent upon others  on the given training data.  The speaker distribution is modeled by  the basis functions.  To asses the efficiency of the basis functions, we performed speaker classification experiments and compared our  results with the conventional Fourier-basis.  Our results show that  the proposed method is more efficient than the conventional  Fourier-based features, in that they can obtain a higher  classification rate.  10 Refs.

Title: A support vector machines-based rejection technique for speech  recognition
Abstract: Support Vector Machines represent a new approach to pattern  classification developed from the theory of Structural Risk  Minimization [1] .  In this paper, we  present an investigation into the application of Support Vector  Machines' to the confidence measurement problem in speech  recognition.  Specifically, based on the results from an initial  decoding of an utterance during speech recognition, we derive a  feature vector consisting of parameters such as word score density,  N-best word score density differences, relative word score and  relative word duration as input to the confidence measurement  process in which hypothetically correct utterances are accepted and  utterances determined to be incorrect are rejected.  We propose a new approach to training Support Vector Machines.  In this paper, we have trained and tested a Support Vector Machines classifier and compared the results with other statistical classification methods.  6 Refs.

Title: Robust classification of stop consonants using auditory-based speech  processing
Abstract: In this work, a feature-based system for the automatic classification of stop consonants, in speaker independent continuous speech, is  reported.  The system uses a new auditory-based speech processing  front-end that is based on the biologically rooted property of  average localized synchrony detection (ALSD).  It incorporates new  algorithms for the extraction and manipulation of the  acoustic-phonetic features that proved, statistically, to be rich in their information content.  The experiments are performed on stop  consonants extracted from the TIMIT database with additive white  Gaussian noise at various signal-to-noise ratios.  The obtained  classification accuracy compares favorably with previous work.  The  results also showed a consistent improvement of 3% in the place  detection over the Generalized Synchrony Detector (GSD) system under identical circumstances on clean and noisy speech.  This illustrates  the superior ability of the ALSD to suppress the spurious peaks and  produce a consistent and robust format (peak) representation.  15  Refs.

Title: Classification by probabilistic clustering
Abstract: This paper describes an approach to classification based on a  probabilistic clustering method.  Most current classifiers perform  classification by modeling class conditional densities directly or  by modeling class-dependent discriminant functions.  The approach  described in this paper uses class-independent multi-layer  perceptrons (MLPs) to estimate the probability that two given  feature vectors are in the same class.  These probability estimates  are used to partition the input into separate classes in a  probabilistic clustering.  Classification by probabilistic clustering potentially offers greater robustness to different compositions of  training and test sets than existing classification methods.   Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the method  are given for an optical character recognition (OCR) problem.  The  relationship of the current approach to mixture density estimation,  mixture discriminant analysis, and other OCR and handwriting  recognition techniques is discussed.  8 Refs.

Title: Optimization in companion search spaces: The case of cross-entropy  and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm
Abstract: We present a new learning algorithm for the supervised training of  multilayer perceptions for classification that is significantly  faster than any previously known method.  Like existing methods, the  algorithm assumes a multilayer perceptron with a normalized  exponential (softmax) output trained under a cross-entropy  criterion.  However, this output-criteria pairing turns out to have  poor properties for existing optimization methods (backpropagation  and its second order extensions) because second-order expansion of  the network weights about the optimal solution is not a good  approximation.  The proposed algorithm overcomes this limitation by  defining a new search space for which a second-order expansion is  valid and such that the optimal solution in the new space coincides  with the original criterion.  This allows the application of the  Levenberg-Marquardt search procedure to the cross-entropy criterion, which was previously thought applicable only to a mean square error  criteria.  6 Refs.

Title: Dual nu-support vector machine with error rate and training size  biasing
Abstract: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have been successfully applied to  classification problems.  The difficulty in selecting the most  effective error penalty has been partly resolved with nu-SVM.   However, the use of uneven training class sizes, which occurs  frequently with target detection problems, results in machines with  biases towards the class with the larger training set.  We propose an extended nu-SVM to counter the effects of the unbalanced training  class sizes.  The resulting Dual nu-SVM provides the facility to  counter these effects, as well as to adjust the error penalties of  each class separately.  The parameter nu of each class provides a  lower bound to the fraction of support vector of that class, and the upper bound to the fraction of bounded support vector of that class.  These bounds allow the control on the error rates allowed for each  class, and enable the training of machines with specific error rate  requirements.  6 Refs.

Title: A new algorithm for EEG feature selection using mutual information
Abstract: An EEG feature selection technique for the purpose of classification  is developed.  The technique selects those features that have maximum mutual information with the specified classes of interest (two  classes in this case).  Obviously, the simplest way is to consider  all possible feature subsets (M out of N).  However, even with a  small number of features, this procedure is computationally  impossible and can not be used in practice.  Given the fact that most features used to represent EEG signal are sets of features (such as  AR parameters), our technique considers a trade off between  computational cost and chosen feature combination.  This contrasts  other techniques which select features individually.  The  classification accuracy of features obtained by applying our  technique outperforms those obtained by applying individual feature  selection methods when applied to EEG signals.  5 Refs.

Title: A hybrid coder based on a new phase model for synchronization between harmonic and waveform coded segments
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid coder with a new phase model to  synchronize harmonic and waveform coded segments, with a target bit  rate of 4 kbps.  The coder also employs a new technique based on  analysis by synthesis to distinguish between stationary and  transitional segments.  Harmonic excitation is synchronized with the  LPC residual by transmitting the location of the pitch pulse closest to the frame boundary and a phase value that represents the shape of the corresponding pitch pulse.  The performance of this phase model  and the classification technique is evaluated using a hybrid coder.   The coder has three modes: scaled white noise excitation colored by  LPC for unvoiced, ACELP for transitions, and harmonic excitation for stationary segments.  Subjective listening tests show that the coder  produces good quality speech and the switching between the modes is  transparent.  9 Refs.

Title: Content-based retrieval of video shot using the improved nearest  feature line method
Abstract: The shot based classification and retrieval is very important for  video database organization and access.  In this paper we present a  new approach 'Nearest Feature Line - NFL' used in shot retrieval.  We look key-frames in shot as feature points to represent the shot in  feature space.  Lines connecting the feature points are further used  to approximate the variations in the whole shot.  The similarity  between the query image and the shots in video database are measured by calculating the distance between the query image and the feature  lines in feature space.  To make it more suitable to video data, we  improved the original NFL method by adding constraints on the  feature lines.  Experimental results show that our improved NFL  method is better than the traditional classification methods such as Nearest Neighbor (NN) and Nearest Center (NC).  9 Refs.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the general problem of technical document  interpretation, applied to the documents of the French Telephonic  Operator, France Telecom.  More precisely, we focus the content of  this paper on the computation and the use of a new set of features  allowing the classification of multi-oriented and multi-scaled  patterns, as well as the rotation and scale parameters estimation.   This set of invariants is based on the Fourier-Mellin transform  (FMT).  This transformation has two interesting properties in the  context of our study.  The first relies on the excellent  classification rate which is obtained with this method.  Secondly, it provides a robust estimator of orientation and scale of the  processed patterns through the use of the shift theorem of the  Fourier transform.  A comparison with parameter estimation issued  from the Zernike moments is also given.  13 Refs.

Title: Recognition of face profiles from the MUGSHOT database using a hybrid connectionist/HMM approach
Abstract: Biometrical systems have been the focus of concentrated research  efforts in recent years.  These systems can be used to identify a  person or to grant a person access to something, e.g. a room.  Face  recognition technology has reached a level of performance at which  frontal-view recognition of faces with slightly different facial  expressions, view angles or head poses can be considered nearly  solved.  In this paper we present a novel hybrid ANN/HMM approach to  recognize a person from that person's profile view (90 degree )  although the recognition system is trained with only one single  frontal view of the person.  Such a system can be useful for mugshot  identification where a victim or witness has seen the criminal from  the side only.  Our approach uses neural methods in order to  synthesize a profile out of the frontal view using no additional  knowledge about the 3D shape and structure of a human head.  The  classification of the generated images is accomplished using a  statistical HMM-approach.  13 Refs.

Title: Acoustic emission classification using signal subspace projections
Abstract: In using acoustic emissions (AE) for mechanical diagnostics, one  major problem is the differentiation of events due to crack growth  in a component from noise of various origins.  This work presents two algorithms for automatic clustering and separation of AE events  based on multiple features extracted from experimental data.  The  first algorithm consists of two steps.  In the first step, the noise  is separated from the events of interest and subsequently removed  using a combination of covariance analysis, principal component  analysis (PCA), and differential time delay estimates.  The second  step processes the remaining data using a self-organizing map (SOM), which outputs the noise and AE signals into separate neurons.  The  algorithm is verified with two sets of data, and a correct  classification ratio of over 95% is achieved.  The second algorithm  characterizes the AE signal subspace based on the principal  eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of an ensemble of the AE  signals.  The latter algorithm has a correct classification ratio  over 90%.  9 Refs.

Title: Geometric linear discriminant analysis
Abstract: When it becomes necessary to reduce the complexity of a classifier,  dimensionality reduction can be an effective way to address  classifier complexity.  Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is one  approach to dimensionality reduction that makes use of a linear  transformation matrix.  The widely used Fisher's LDA is "sub-optimal" when the sample class covariance matrices are unequal, meaning that  another linear transformation exists that produces lower loss in  discrimination power.  In this paper, we introduce a geometric  approach to Linear Discriminant Analysis (GLDA) that can reduce the  number of dimensions from n to m for any number of classes.  GLDA is  able to compute a better linear transformation matrix than Fisher's  LDA for unequal sample class covariance matrices and is equivalent  to Fisher's LDA when those matrices are equal or proportional.  The  classification problems we present in this paper demonstrate and  strongly suggest that geometric LDA can generate the "optimal"  classifier in a lower dimension.  4 Refs.

Title: Class-based identification of underwater targets using hidden Markov  models
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that hidden Markov models (HMMs) provide an  effective architecture for classification of distinct targets from  multiple target-sensor orientations.  In this paper, we present a  methodology for designing class-based HMMs that are well suited to  the identification of targets with common physical attributes.  This  approach provides a means to form associations between existing  target classes and data from targets never observed in training.   After performing a wavefront-resonance matching-pursuits feature  extraction, we present an information theoretic tree-based  state-parsing algorithm to define the HMM state structure for each  target class.  In training, class association is determined by  minimizing the statistical divergence between the target under  consideration and each existing class, with a new class defined when the target is poorly matched to each existing class.  The class-based HMMs are trained with data from the members of its corresponding  class, and tested on previously unobserved data.  Results are  presented for simulated acoustic scattering data.  5 Refs.

Title: Estimation of source location based on 2-D MUSIC and its application  to speech recognition in cars
Abstract: This paper proposes a speech recognition and an enhancement system  for noisy car environments based on a microphone array.  In the  system, multiple microphones are arranged in 2-dimensional space,  surrounding the interior of a car, and the speaker's location is  first estimated by our proposed HE (Harmonic Enhanced) 2-D MUSIC  (MUltiple SIgnal Classification).  Then, 2-D Delay and Sum (DS) is  applied to enhance the target speech.  Such pre-processing makes  robust speech recognition in noisy car environments possible.  In the proposed system, not only a driver, but also a fellow passenger can  control car electronics by their voices no matter where they are.   This is an advantage of the system as well.  The results of the  simulation and the preliminary experiment in a real car environment  are presented to confirm the validity of our proposed system.  9  Refs.

Title: Markov modeling of transient scattering and its application in  multi-aspect target classification
Abstract: Transient scattered fields from a general target are composed of  wavefronts, resonances and time delays, with these constituents  linked to the target geometry.  A classifier applied transient  scattering data requires a statistical model for such fundamental  constituents.  A Markov model is employed to characterized the  transient scattered fields - for a set of target-sensor orientation  over which the transient scattering is stationary - utilizing a  wavefront, resonance, time-delay "alphabet".  The Markov model is  utilized in a classifier developed for multi-aspect transient  scattering data, with a hidden Markov model (HMM) employed to  address the generally non-stationary nature of the multi-aspect  waveforms.  Each state of the HMM is characteristic of a set of  target-sensor orientations for which the scattering statistics are  stationary, the statistics of which are characterized via the  aforementioned Markov model.  The wavefront, resonance and time-delay features are extracted via a modified matching-pursuits algorithm.  6 Refs.

Title: Dynamic airborne sensor resource management for ground moving target  tracking and classification
Abstract: In this paper we describe an algorithm for dynamic Sensor Resource  Management (SRM) of a multimode sensor for tracking and  classification of ground moving targets.  The sensor is an airborne  mechanically steered radar that operates in Ground Moving Target  Indicator (GMTI) and High Range Resolution (HRR) modes.  The SRM  problem is cast into an optimization framework with a  multi-objective criteria, namely, minimize tracking kinematic and  target classification uncertainties where Markov models and decision trees are utilized, respectively, to dynamically capture (at the  frame revisit rate) the tracking and classification information  state.  The SRM algorithm derives a sensor collection schedule on a  frame by frame basis utilizing tracking updates from a GMTI Multiple Hypothesis Tracker (MHT) and classification updates from an HRR 1-D  Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) algorithm.  Preliminary results  based on a simulated ground target scenario are presented  demonstrating the inherent trade-offs between the two radar modes  and the multi-objective SRM criteria.  4 Refs.

Title: Signal processing and fault detection with application to CH-46  helicopter data
Abstract: Central to Qualtech Systems' mission is its testability and  maintenance software (TEAMS) and derivatives.  Many systems comprise  components equipped with self-testing capability; but, if the system is complex (and involves feedback and if the self-testing itself may occasionally be faulty) tracing faults to a single or multiple  causes is difficult.  However, even for systems involving many  thousands of components the PC-based TEAMS provides essentially  real-time system-state diagnosis.  Until recently TEAMS operation was passive: its diagnoses were based on whatever data sensors could  provide.  Now, however, a signal-processing (SP) "front-end" matched  to inference needs is available.  Many standard signal processing  primitives, such as filtering, spectrum analysis and  multi-resolution decomposition are available; the SP toolbox is also equipped with a (supervised) classification capability based on a  number of decision-making paradigms.  This paper is about the SP  toolbox.  We show its capabilities, and demonstrate its performance  on the CH-46 "Westland" data set.  8 Refs.

Title: Construction of an omnidirectional mobile robot platform based on active dual-wheel caster mechanisms and development of a control simulator
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a new type of holonomic and omnidirectional mobile robot using two driving assemblies, one of which consists of two independent driving wheel mechanisms, just like an active dual-wheel caster with an offset steered axis.  Kinematic models of the wheel mechanism and a mobile robot with two driving assemblies are derived, and these models are applied to construct a feedback control system based on a resolved velocity control system for the robot.  The effectiveness of the presented method is illustrated by some computer simulations.  The prototype of a mobile robot platform using two driving assemblies, which can be controlled by a personal computer or a 3D joystick manipulated by human, is constructed.

Title: Design and test of a board for CNN-based stereo vision
Abstract: One of the most essential requirements in robotic autonomous navigation is the extraction of three-dimensional information about the environment in order to avoid collisions with moving or fixed obstacles.  Among the others, one of the most promising approaches for this task is represented by the techniques of artificial vision.  Several implementations of different approaches have been proposed in many papers in literature.  In particular, the authors presented an implementation of the Stereo Vision Algorithm using the Cellular Neural Networks.  In this paper, the design of an electronic board with dedicated CNN analogue chips able to implement the algorithm will be presented.  (Author abstract) 10 Refs.

Title: Snake-like motions of multibody systems over a rough plane
Abstract: Motions of multibody systems over a rough horizontal plane are investigated.  The system under consideration is a linkage consisting of several rigid bodies connected by revolute joints with vertical axes.  Control torques are created by actuators installed at the joints.  Dry friction forces between the linkage and the plane act upon the system.  It is shown that the multibody system can move in an arbitrary direction: lengthwise, sideways, and rotate.  Different modes of motion of two-link, three-link, and multilink systems are investigated.  The control laws for periodic and wave-like motions are proposed.  The displacements and speed of motions are estimated, and optimal parameters are obtained which maximize the average speed.  The results of computer simulation are presented.  The obtained results are discussed with respect to motions of snakes and other animals, as well as to possible applications to mobile robots.  (Author abstract) 6 Refs.

Title: Robust stabilization via iterative state steering with an application to chained-form systems
Abstract: An approach is presented for the robust stabilization of non-linear systems.  The proposed strategy can be adopted whenever it is possible to compute a control law that steers the state in finite time from any initial condition to a point closer to the desired equilibrium.  Under suitable assumptions, such control law can be applied in an iterative fashion, obtaining uniform asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point, with exponential rate of convergence.  Small non-persistent perturbations are rejected, while persistent perturbations induce limited errors.  In order to show the usefulness of the presented theoretical developments, the approach is applied to chained-form systems and, for illustration, simulations results are given for the robust stabilization of a unicycle.

Title: Coupled oscillator control of autonomous mobile robots
Abstract: This paper introduces a nonlinear oscillator scheme to control autonomous mobile robots.  The method is based on observations of a successful control mechanism used in nature, the Central Pattern Generator.  Simulations were used to assess the performance of oscillator controller when used to implement several behaviors in an autonomous robot operating in a closed arena.  A sequence of basic behaviors (random wandering, obstacle avoidance and light following) was coordinated in the robot to produce the higher behavior of foraging for light.  The controller is explored in simulations and tests on physical robots.  It is shown that the oscillator - based controller outperforms a reactive controller in the tasks of exploring an arena with irregular walls and in searching for light.  (Author abstract) 34 Refs.

Title: Outdoor visual position estimation for planetary rovers
Abstract: This paper describes (1) a novel, effective algorithm for outdoor visual position estimation; (2) the implementation of this algorithm in the Viper system; and (3) the extensive tests that have demonstrated the superior accuracy and speed of the algorithm.  The Viper system (Visual Position Estimator for Rovers) is geared towards robotic space missions, and the central purpose of the system is to increase the situational awareness of a rover operator by presenting accurate position estimates.  The system has been extensively tested with terrestrial and lunar imagery, in terrains ranging from moderate- the rounded hills of Pittsburgh and the high deserts of Chile- to rugged - the dramatic relief of the Apollo 17 landing site- to extreme - the jagged peaks of the Rockies.  Results have consistently demonstrated that the visual estimation algorithm estimates position with an accuracy and reliability that greatly surpass previous work.  (Author abstract) 55 Refs.

Title: Absolute location by landmark extraction
Abstract: To limit cumulative errors due to the odometer, we propose an absolute location method based on the extraction and the use of geometrical landmarks.  This method also avoids the need of prior knowledge of the robot environment (no training steps) and its specified fitting (no beacons).  If different measurements of the environment around the robot taken by an ultrasonic telemeter are merged, geometrical primitives appear.  They are then discriminated and rebuilt.  Those primitives are the landmarks used by the locating system.  Hence a set of definitions and laws have been established to conjointly use few landmarks, in order to obtain the mobile robot absolute location by triangulation.  (Author abstract) 8 Refs.

Title: GPS latency identification by Kalman filtering
Abstract: For outdoor mobile robots localization, GPS has obvious advantages: position data are directly given in an absolute frame, and the required infrastructure is reduced to a sole fixed station in the case of differential systems.  Yet, the use of this solution raises a number of issues, such as the satellite maskings, or the existence of the so-called GPS latency which delays the output of the localization data.  This paper deals with the latter problem, and proposes a method to identify this parameter without using other exteroceptive sensors.  Experimental results are presented based on trials carried out at the Centre d'Experimentations Routieres (CER) in Rouen, in collaboration with the Laboratoire Central des Ponts et Chaussees (LCPC).

Title: General learning co-evolution method to generalize autonomous robot navigation behavior
Abstract: In this paper a new coevolutive method, called Uniform Coevolution, is introduced, to learn weights of a neural network controller in autonomous robots.  An evolutionary strategy is used to learn high-performance reactive behavior for navigation and collisions avoidance.  The coevolutive method allows evolving the environment, to learn a general behavior able to solve the problem in different environments.  Using a traditional evolutionary strategy method, without coevolution, the learning process obtains a specialized behavior.  All the behaviors obtained, with/without coevolution have been tested in a set of environments and the capability of generalization is shown for each learned behavior.  A simulator based on mini-robot Khepera has been used to learn each behavior.  The results show that Uniform Coevolution obtains better generalized solutions to examples-based problems.

Title: Evolutionary programming-based fuzzy logic path planner and follower for mobile robots
Abstract: A fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for mobile robots is designed in hierarchial structure.  The designed FLC consists of two levels: the planner level and the motion control level.  The planner level generates a path to the destination with obstacle avoidance.  The singleton outputs of the planner are obtained using line and arc methods.  The lower motion control level calculates the robot's wheel velocity so as to follow the path generated by the planner as to the current robot posture.  The fuzzy singleton outputs are obtained by heuristic and tuned by evolutionary programming.  The applicability of the controller is demonstrated using robot soccer system.

Title: Online map building evolutionary algorithm for multi-agent mobile robots with odometric uncertainty
Abstract: An online map building evolutionary algorithm is proposed using multi-agent mobile robots with odometric uncertainty.  The control algorithm for map building in each robot is identical and trained by online evolutionary algorithm (EA).  Each robot has configuration uncertainty which increases as it moves, and it perceives the surrounding environment information by the limited range sensors.  It communicates with other robots and shares the information.  The elementary behaviors are defined and they are used to build a map.  EA is applied to the defined behavior set for optimizing the robot actions.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, computer simulations are conducted for various environments.

Title: Umbilical positioning using ultrasonic sensors
Abstract: The work presented in this paper describes the development of an autonomous umbilical positioning system.  The umbilical positioning system shall provide electrical power and fiber optic data cable connections between two simulated vehicles 100 meter apart.  The Omnibot is used to provide the mobile base for the system.  The mate-in umbilical plate is mounted on a three axis Cartesian manipulator, which is installed on the Omnibot mobile base.  The Omnibot is controlled in a teleoperated mode.  The operator using the vision system will guide the mobile base to get close to the mate-to plate.  The information received from ultrasonic sensors is used to identify the position of mate-to plate and mate the umbilical plates autonomously.  A successful experimentation verifies the approach.

Title: Centering behavior with a mobile robot using monocular foveated vision
Abstract: A system for corridor following based on properties of the human visual system is presented.  The robot extracts image features using an interest operator to compute sparse optical flow induced by the translatory motion of the robot.  The available status information from the robot is used to compensate for the known rotatory movement of the image.  Control of the robot is done by transforming the optical flow to ego-motion complex log space.  The difference between the median flow extracted from the left and right peripheral visual areas is used to control the heading of the robot.  Forward velocity is controlled by trying to keep the perceived optical flow constant.  (Author abstract) 44 Refs.

Title: Reduction of dimensionality for perceptual clustering
Abstract: Multidimensionality is one of the problems to be solved for a robust methodology in order to be capable of resolving simple and realistic problems.  This work establishes a complete methodology based on self-organized maps (SOM) and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that finds an abstract probability function, which is a mix of local experts.  An application of this methodology is presented as a case study, where the problem is robot navigation in noisy environments.  Readings from seven robot sonars were taken as input for the system, mapped into a two dimension space and grouped into abstract observations, in order to make recognition of navigation space environment dependant and accurate.  The goal is to build the capability of predicting observations and of recognizing abstractions that were defined over the data itself.  (Author abstract) 12 Refs.

Title: Improving hallway navigation in mobile robots with sensor habituation
Abstract: Habituation is a form of non-associative learning observed in a variety of species of animals.  Arguably, it is the simplest form of learning.  Nonetheless, the ability to habituate to certain stimuli implies plastic neural systems and adaptive behaviors.  This article describes how computational models of habituation can be applied to real robots.  In particular, we discuss the problem of the oscillatory movements observed when a Khepera robot navigates through narrow hallways.  Results show that habituation to the proximity of the walls can lead to smoother navigation.  Habituation to sensory stimulation to the sides of the robot does not interfere with the robot's ability to turn at dead ends and to avoid obstacles outside the hallway.  This work shows that simple biological mechanisms of learning can be adapted to achieve better performance in real mobile robots.  (Author abstract) 15 Refs.

Title: Time series segmentation using an adaptive resource allocating vector quantization network based on change detection
Abstract: We present a novel architecture for unsupervised time series segmentation which is based on change detection rather than traditional error minimization.  The architecture, which consists of a simple vector quantizer which dynamically allocates model vectors when needed, is able to split a multi-dimensional noisy time series generated from the sensors of a mobile robot into relevant segments using just a single presentation of the data.  We compare the architecture with an existing system created by Nolfi and Tani (1999), which is based on traditional overall error minimization, and note that our system is able to detect stable and distinct signal regions which are not detected by their system.

Title: Multi-objective behavior coordinate for a mobile robot with fuzzy neural networks
Abstract: This paper deals with a multi-objective behavior coordinate for a mobile robot using fuzzy control and neural network.  A task given to a mobile robot includes various objectives such as collision avoiding, target tracing, and wall following.  We apply fuzzy control for describing each behavior of the robot.  However, a behavior might share some fuzzy rules with other behaviors.  Therefore, this paper proposes a reconfiguring method for a set of fuzzy rules.  The combination of fuzzy rules is updated dynamically by a neural network according to the perceptual information.  Furthermore, this paper describes a learn method of the neural network and fuzzy rules based on error functions.  Simulation results show that the robot can take multi-objective behavior by the proposed method.  (Author abstract) 12 Refs.

Title: Applying synaptic delays for virtual sensing and actuation in mobile robots
Abstract: In this article we describe the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with synaptic time delays between the nodes as a means to increase the capabilities of the usual control modules used in behavior based robotics.  This inclusion allows the controllers to manage explicit temporal information in different levels.  In the sensing level it permits the use of virtual sensors that improve the precision of the information provided by sensors through a temporal correlation of their values.  In the actuation level we use the network with an infrasensorized robot in a problem that requires active sensing, where the control and actuation mechanisms are coordinated in order to obtain a better sensorial image of the environment by means of a spatio-temporal representation of a perception sequence.  The decision of the appropriate delays is automated through learning and evolution.  (Author abstract) 9 Refs.

Title: Inverse kinematics of passive redundancy space robots
Abstract: The coupling of passive joints and actuated joints in passive redundancy space robots are analyzed, and formulated a measure about the coupling which can be considered as a performance index in planing robot motion.  The kinematics singularity of passive redundancy robots and the difference about the singularity between the passive and the non-passive redundancy robots also are analyzed.  A passive redundancy robot manipulability index which also can be used in planing robot motion, is defined.  The concept of  proximate self-motion' for the passive redundancy robot, is presented the  proximate self-motion' can optimum the motion when robot completes a end-effector mission.  In the simulation faction, a planar 3 - DOF space station robot exhibits the ability of the  proximate self-motion' in avoiding the kinematics singularity.  (Author abstract) 10 Refs.

Abstract: Independent joint control for robots is enhanced to suppress the dynamic couplings by incorporating an acceleration feedback loop that is designed in terms of its stability and ability in resisting the dynamic coupling disturbances.  The sensing and modeling of joint acceleration via linear accelerometers is dealt from the viewpoint of practical implementation.  Extensive experiments are conducted on a three-link direct drive robot, to mainly investigate the ability of the independent joint controller with the acceleration loop in resisting the coupling torque, and demonstrating the enhanced trajectory tracking performance.  Results are given against the ones obtained by conventional independent joint control without the acceleration feedback control.  (Author abstract) 19 Refs.

Title: Real-time kinematics on the translational crawl motion of a quadruped robot
Abstract: It is known that the kinematics of a quadruped robot is complex due to its topology and the redundant actuation in the robot.  However, it is fundamental to compute the inverse and direct kinematics for the sophisticated control of the robot in real-time.  In this paper, the translational crawl gait of a quadruped robot is introduced and the approach to find the solution of the kinematics for such a crawl motion is proposed.  Since the resulting kinematics is simplified, the formulation can be used for the real-time control of the robot.  The results of simulation and experiment shows that the present method is feasible and efficient.  (Author abstract) 29 Refs.

Title: Gait optimization of biped robot using genetic algorithm
Abstract: A 24 DOF humanoid robot (JFHR) was chosen for gait optimization.  The dynamic model of JFHR was established as a seven-link biped.  Motion of the hip and feet during a regular step was then modeled by the 3rd order polynomials, and the energy consumption was obtained to form the robot dynamic equation.  Therefore, the energy optimal gait, which is represented by the coefficients of polynomials, may be expressed as a multi-variable minimization problem, and genetic algorithm was applied to obtain the optimal solution.  In the genetic algorithm designing, every parameter to be optimized is encoded as 10 bit binary string, the total length of each chromosome is decided by the parameter number.  The population for each generation is 50, the evolvement generation is fixed to 100.  The crossover rate and mutation rate are set to 0.8 and 0.04 respectively.  The simulation of walking on level ground and incline was presented.  (Author abstract) 4 Refs.

Title: Kinematic analysis and optimization of a new three degree-of-freedom spatial parallel manipulator
Abstract: A study of the kinematic characteristics of a three degree-of-freedom (dof) parallel mechanism is presented.  The architecture of the mechanism is comprised of a mobile platform attached to a base through three identical prismatic-revolute-spherical jointed serial linkages.  The prismatic joints are considered to be actuated.  These prismatic actators lie on a common plane and have radial directions of action.  The mechanism's inverse displacement solution is obtained.  Since the mechanism has only 3 dof, constraint equations describing the inter-relationship between the six motion coordinates are derived.  These constraints allow the definition of parasitic motions, i.e., motions in the three unspecified motion coordinates.  Architecture optimization of the device is undertaken demonstrating that specific values of design variables allow minimization of parasitic motion.  (Author abstract) 19 Refs.

Title: Approximately arc-length parametrized C**3 quintic interpolatory splines
Abstract: A quasi-global interpolation method that fits a quintic spline curve to a set of designated data points is described in this paper.  The resultant curve has several important features.  First, the curve is smooth with C**3 continuity and has no unwanted oscillations.  Second, the generated quintic spline is  optimally' parametrized; that is, the curve is parametrized very closely to its arc length.  In addition, with the interpolation method, straight line segments can be preserved to generate a quintic spline of hybrid curve segments.  The properties of C**3 continuity and the  near arc length' parametrization have direct applications to trajectory planning in robotics and the development of new types of machine tool controllers for high speed and precision machining.  The encapsulation of straight line segments enhances the capability for the shape designers to design more complicated shapes, including free form curves and straight line segments in a uniform way.

Abstract: In Carnegie Mellon University's CyberScout project, we are developing mobile and stationary sentries capable of autonomous reconnaissance and surveillance.  In this paper, we describe recent advances in the areas of efficient perception algorithms (detection, classification, and correspondence) and mission planning.  In detection, we have achieved improved rejection of camera jitter and environmental variations (e.g., lighting, moving foliage) through multi-modal filtering, and we have implemented panoramic backgrounding through pseudo-real-time mosaicing.  In classification, we present methods for discriminating between individuals, groups of individuals, and vehicles, and between individuals with and without backpacks.  In correspondence, we describe an accurate multi-hypothesis approach based on both motion and appearance.  Finally, in mission planning, we describe mapbuilding using multiple sensory cues and a computationally efficient decentralized planner for multiple platforms.  (Author abstract) 12 Refs.

Title: Micro-unattended mobility system for grenade launcher deployed sensors (MUMS II)
Abstract: This paper describes the development of a robotic system that will provide limited mobility capability to ballistically deployed sensors for acquisition of intelligence from building interiors.  The future of warfare is expected to shift from large-scale battles to smaller conflicts in increasingly urban environments.  Success in such situations can be improved by providing the war fighter detailed information about the location, activities, and capabilities of the opponents.  A limited mobility capability adds to the usefulness of grenade launcher deployed sensors in two important ways.  First, it relaxes the targeting accuracy requirement allowing a higher probability of successful placement even at greater ranges.  Second, it increases the convertness of the sensor by allowing precise placement in an unobtrusive location.  Underlying technologies required to implement this approach include a method of attaching the sensor package to the wall and shock tolerant electronics.  (Author abstract) 3 Refs.

Title: Human-robot interaction over the internet
Abstract: This paper describes two Java-based Internet control mechanisms, manual control and autonomous navigation, for a mobile robot to allow users to explore the robot's environment.  In the manual control, a user sends control commands to the robot over the Internet to make the robot explore its environment.  In the autonomous navigation mode, the user only needs to specify the target point and the rest of the task is taken care of by the robot.  In both cases, the real time video images, the robot trajectory, and a status report of the robot are sent to the user over the Internet.  In addition, sonar readings are transmitted over the Internet in the manual control to provide more detailed information to the user.  The mobile robot was successfully controlled from several locations in the USA.  (Author abstract) 9 Refs.

Title: Fuzzy integrated robotic behavioral architecture
Abstract: We propose a variant of the fine-grained Subsumption Architecture [4] .  We use active perception layers instead of whole behavior components.  This provides for context sensitive behavior arbitration.  Each behavior is tied to an active perception unit that may implement a behavior selection mechanism.  Further, information passing between layers in terms of fuzzy variables is suggested.  This allows for graceful command arbitration at the action execution layer.  The whole robot control system can be viewed as a multi-stage fuzzy control system.  We also provide a brief discussion of our implementation of the architecture.  The minimal implementation of the scheme has provided encouraging results and further work is on in the analysis of the architecture.  (Author abstract) 4 Refs.

Abstract: To enhance the mobility of the USU T-class of vehicles, the T3 vehicle has been developed that incorporates Z-axis motion of the drive wheel modules.

The omni-directional capability of the vehicle provides the capability to align the vehicle with the slope gradient that maximizes the vehicle stability.  This paper shows that by pitching the vehicle into the slope, that the uphill traction limit of the vehicle can be increased by about 10 degree .

Title: Off-road vehicle locomotion using Bekker's model
Abstract: Bekker's Derived Terramechanics Model (BDTM) is an analytical tool for evaluating vehicle off-road mobility.  BDTM has been developed using Bekker's equations for vehicle soil interactions.  He developed the bevameter technique to measure mechanical strength characteristics for many soil and snow conditions.  BDTM is in a spreadsheet format, and its primary purpose is to compare mobility characteristics for robotic track and wheeled vehicles under different terrain conditions.  Bekker's model is a simple, linear one degree-of-freedom (1-DOF) model, which assumes that in a perfectly cohesive soil (i.e. clay), soil thrust is only a function of contact surface area.  The model also assumes that for a perfectly cohesionless or frictional soil (i.e. dry sand), soil thrust is a function of vehicular weight.  This paper attempts to compare the mobility characteristics of wheeled vs. track vehicles for different size, weight and terrain conditions.  (Author abstract) 5 Refs.

Abstract: In response to ultra-high maneuverability vehicle requirements, Utah State University (USU) has developed an autonomous vehicle with unique mobility and maneuverability capabilities.  This paper describes a study of the mobility of the USU T2 Omni-Directional Vehicle (ODV).  The T2 vehicle is a mid-scale (625 kg), second-generation ODV mobile robot with six independently driven and steered wheel assemblies.  The six wheel, independent steering system is capable of unlimited steering rotation, presenting a unique solution to enhanced vehicle mobility requirements.  This mobility study focuses on energy consumption in three basic experiments, comparing two modes of steering: Ackerman and ODV.  The experiments are all performed on the same vehicle without any physical changes to the vehicle itself, providing a direct comparison of these two steering methodologies.  A computer simulation of the T2 mechanical and control system dynamics is described.  (Author abstract) 4 Refs.

Previously we developed a robot localization system, namely, the Gaussian Mixture of Bayes with Regularized Expectation Maximization (GMB-REM), which introduced the sensor selection technique.  GMB-REM allows a robot's position to be modelled as a probability distribution and uses Bayes' theorem to reduce the uncertainty of its location.  A new sensor selection technique incorporated with sensor fusion is introduced in this paper.  Actually the new technique is realized by incorporating with the sensor fusion scheme.  Empirical results show that the new system outperforms the previous GMB-REM with sensor selection alone.  More specifically, we illustrate that the new technique is able to considerably constrain the error of a robot's position.  (Author abstract) 18 Refs.

Title: Evaluation of influence of target location on robot repeatability
Abstract: This paper evaluates the influence of target location on robot repeatability.  An experiment was set up to analyze the effect of the three-dimensional target location on robot repeatability.  An error-analysis model to determine repeatability based on the robot's kinematic model and known robot parameters was developed.  Experimental results indicated that there was a significant statistical difference between repeatability at different locations in the workspace and that the height of the target point influenced repeatability.  Experimental results tended to those derived from the error-analysis kinematic model.  Hence, to determine the optimal target location, there is no need for extensive experimentation; instead, only a few target points can be sampled and compared to an error-analysis model.

Title: Sensor information space for robust mobile robot path planning
Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to robust path planning for mobile robots entirely based on information from environment perception sensors.  This method avoids the use of odometry which leads to the accumulation of errors resulting from the robot's position computing.  We proceed as follows: we create regions inside which the robot detects the same obstacle segments.  A node graph represents all the regions and their links.  Then a planning algorithm is used to find a path which joins a start to a goal region.  The final stage consists in applying a robust robot motion control as regards the uncertainties of the environment model.  This approach contributes to a control system for indoor robots which is environment referenced.  The sensors we deal with are first a continuous laser or ultrasonic scanning system, then a discrete ultrasonic belt whose limits of use we show.  (Author abstract) 9 Refs.

Title: Local on-line planning in biped robot locomotion amongst unknown obstacles
Abstract: The focus of this work is on sensor-based motion planning for a biped robot operating in a scene with unknown obstacles.  Using on-line sensor information about its surroundings, the robot negotiates obstacles on its way.  Depending on the obstacle's shape size, and location, the decision-making system chooses an appropriate walking pattern.  The robot then negotiates the obstacle and resumes stable motion.  The walking pattern is chosen from a small number of precomputed patterns that together cover a reasonably wide range of possible situations.  The overall control strategy is based on the concept of Zero Moment Point.  Each precomputed pattern guarantees dynamically stable motion; its stability is obtained by adjusting the swing leg center of mass and hip position trajectories.  The approach is fast enough for real-time implementation.  Simulation experiments demonstrate stability of motion when negotiating various obstacles.  (Author abstract) 12 Refs.

Title: Probabilistic approach to collaborative multi-robot localization
Abstract: This paper presents a statistical algorithm for collaborative mobile robot localization.  Our approach uses a sample-based version of Markov localization, capable of localizing mobile robots in an any-time fashion.  When teams of robots localize themselves in the same environment, probabilistic methods are employed to synchronize each robot's belief whenever one robot detects another.   As a result, the robots localize themselves faster, maintain higher accuracy, and high-cost sensors are amortized across multiple robot platforms.  The technique has been implemented and tested using two mobile robots equipped with cameras and laser range-finders for detecting other robots.  The results, obtained with the real robots and in series of simulation runs, illustrate drastic improvements in localization speed and accuracy when compared to conventional single-robot localization.  A further experiment demonstrates that under certain conditions, successful localization is only possible if teams of heterogeneous robots collaborate during localization.

Title: Towards focused plan monitoring: A technique and an application to mobile robots
Abstract: Until recently, techniques for AI plan generation relied on highly restrictive assumptions that were almost always violated in real-world environments; consequently, robot designers adopted reactive architectures and avoided AI planning techniques.  Some recent research efforts have focused on obviating such assumptions by developing techniques that enable the generation and execution of plans in dynamic, uncertain environments.  In this paper, we discuss one such technique, rationale-based monitoring, originally introduced by Veloso, Pollack, and Cox and we describe our use of it in a simple mobile robot environment.  We review the original approach, describe how it can be adapted for a causal-link planner, and provide experimental results demonstrating that it can lead to improved plans without consuming excessive overhead.  We also describe our use of rationale-based monitoring in a mobile robot office-assistant project currently in progress.  (Author abstract) 16 Refs.

Title: Terrain reconstruction for ground and underwater robots
Abstract: We describe a new image-processing algorithm for estimating both the egomotion of an outdoor robotic platform and the structure of the surrounding terrain.  The algorithm is based on correlation, and is embedded in an iterative, multi-resolution framework.  As such, it is suited to outdoor ground-based and underwater scenes.  Both single-camera rigs and multiple-camera rigs can be accommodated.  The use of multiple synchronized cameras results in more rapid convergence of the iterative approach.  We describe how the algorithm operates, and give examples of its application to three robotic domains: (i) Autonomous mobility of ground-based outdoor robots, (ii) Reconnaissance tasks on ground-based vehicles, and (iii) Underwater robotics.

Title: Mobile robot helper
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a mobile robot helper and its motion control algorithm for handling an object in cooperation with a human.  First, we introduce a prototype of the mobile robot helper, 'MR Helper', which consists of two manipulators and an omni-directional mobile base.  We then propose a control algorithm of the MR Helper for handling an object in cooperation with a human.  The control algorithm specifies the apparent dynamics of the manipulated object so that the human could handle the manipulated object together with the robot.  Load sharing by the MR Helper and a human is also realized by introducing a lifting-up/down system.  The control algorithm is experimentally applied to the 'MR Helper', and the experimental results illustrate the validity of the proposed control algorithms.  (Author abstract) 14 Refs.

Title: Real-time replanning in high-dimensional configuration spaces using sets of homotopic paths
Abstract: Real-time replanning is a prerequisite for motion execution in unpredictably changing environments.  This paper presents a framework that allows real-time re-planning in high-dimensional configuration spaces.  Initially, a planning operation generates a path.  The path is augmented by a set of paths homotopic to it.  This set is represented implicitly by a volume of free space in the work space.  Effectively, this corresponds to delaying part of the planning operation for the homotopic paths until motion execution.  During execution reactive control algorithms are used to select a valid path from the set of homotopic paths, using proximity to the environment as a simple and effective heuristic and thereby significantly pruning the search in the configuration space.  Experimental results are presented to validate the real-time performance of this framework in high-dimensional configuration spaces.  (Author abstract) 13 Refs.

Title: Miniature robotic system for reconnaissance and surveillance
Abstract: This paper presents a miniature robotic system ('scout') useful for reconnaissance and surveillance missions.  A large number of scout robots are deployed and controlled by humans and/or larger 'ranger' robots.  The specially designed and constructed scouts are extremely small (roughly 116cc volume) yet are readily deployable (by tossing or launching), have multiple mobility modes, have multiple sensing capabilities, can transmit and receive data and instructions, and have a limited capability for autonomous action.  The rangers are significantly larger vehicles, based on a commercial-off-the-shelf platform, augmented with scout launchers, radios, and additional sensors.  Together, the scouts and rangers form a hierarchical team capable of carrying our complex missions in a wide variety of environments.  (Author abstract) 10 Refs.

Title: Toward biomorphic control using custom a VLSI CPG chips
Abstract: The locomotor controller for walking, running, swimming, and flying animals is based on a Central Pattern Generator (CPG).  Models of CPGs as systems of coupled non-linear oscillators have been proposed and have been used for the control of robots.  In this paper we describe the implementation of an adaptive CPG model in a compact, custom analog VLSI circuit.  We demonstrate the function of the chip by controlling an underactuated, running robotic leg.  This circuit has adaptive properties that allow it to tune its behavior based on sensory feedback.  To our knowledge this is the first instance of an adaptive CPG chip.  This approach supports the construction of extremely inexpensive, low power and compact controllers for walking, flying and swimming machines.  (Author abstract) 17 Refs.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a device for cooperation of multiple autonomous mobile robots.  A device which enables local communication, named 'Intelligent Data Carrier (IDC)', is proposed.  In this paper, we propose an algorithm to improve efficiency of iterative transportation tasks by autonomous mobile robots.  An autonomous mobile robot gives name of its latest visited destination to an IDC which is located on a junction in a work area.  An IDC summarizes the information from robots and tells a direction that it experts best way to a destination which a robot wants to go.  By the proposed algorithm and system, mobile robots construct information and navigation and improve the efficiency of a task automatically.  We verified the effect of the proposed algorithm by simulations and experiments.  (Author abstract) 8 Refs.

Title: Distributed robot helpers handling a single object in cooperation with a human
Abstract: In this paper, we propose distributed robot helpers, referred to as Dr Helpers and a decentralized control algorithm for them to transport a single object in cooperation with a human/humans.  The Dr Helper consists of an omni-directional mobile base, a six-axis body force sensor, a folk lift, and an onboard controller.  Each robot is controlled as if it has a caster-like mechanism.  The adaptive dual caster action is proposed to improve the maneuverability of the system.  Multiple Dr Helpers could transport a single object in cooperation with a human based on the operator's intentional force/moment.  Experiments using multiple Dr Helpers will illustrate the validity of the proposed control system.  (Author abstract) 12 Refs.

Title: Sensor network perception for mobile robotics
Abstract: The dominant architecture for mobile robot perception uses sensors onboard the robot, providing only a first-person perspective on the environment.  This work describes a novel mobile robot system that uses an environment-based sensor network, providing a powerful third-person perspective on the environment.  In previous work we described an algorithm that computes a real-time spatial-temporal occupancy map from the multiple video streams of the sensor network [5] .  We have also described a novel path-planning algorithm based upon this system [7] .  In this work we describe a novel motion control loop that is based upon tracking the mobile robot in the occupancy map.  Tracking in the fused perceptual space of the sensor network provides several advantages over tracking individually in a set of raw sensor spaces.  We demonstrate a prototype system operating in several dynamic scenarios.  (Author abstract) 13 Refs.

Title: Towards programming tools for robots that integrate probabilistic computation and learning
Abstract: This paper describes a programming language extension of C plus plus , called CES, specifically targeted towards mobile robot control.  CES's design is motivated by a recent series of successful probabilistic methods for mobile robot control, with the goal of facilitating the development of such probabilistic software in future robot applications.  CES extends C plus plus by two ideas: Computing with probability distributions, and built-in mechanisms for learning from examples as a new means of programming.  An example program, used to control a mail-delivering robot with gesture commend interface, illustrates that CES may reduce the code development by two orders of magnitude, CES differs from other special-purpose programming languages in the field, which typically emphasize concurrency and real-time/event-driven processing.

Title: Design of steering mechanism and control of nonholonomic trailer systems
Abstract: A wheeled mobile robot with trailers has been studied as a class of nonholonomic systems.  It is proved that a system of a tractor and trailers with an appropriate connecting mechanism can be stabilized to desired positions via nonholonomic motion control.  Trailers, on the other hand, have been developed and widely used in the industry.  The main focus of industrial design is set on reducing tracking error from a reference trajectory.  This paper attempts to bridge over the gap between these two approaches.  We develop a design theory of trailer systems with passive steering.  The designed systems show a good performance in practical path following, and accept the chained form transformation and nonlinear control strategies for nonholonomic systems.

Title: Passive night vision sensor comparison for unmanned ground vehicle stereo vision navigation
Abstract: One goal of the 'Demo III' unmanned ground vehicle program is to enable autonomous nighttime navigation at speeds of up to 10 m.p.h.  To perform obstable detection at night with stereo vision will require night vision cameras that produce adequate image quality for the driving speeds, vehicle dynamics, obstacle sizes, and scene conditions that will be encountered.  This paper analyzes the suitability of four classes of night vision cameras (3-5 mu m cooled FLIR, 8-12 mu m cooled FLIR, 8-12 mu m uncooled FLIR, and intensifiers) for night stereo vision, using criteria based on stereo matching quality, image signal to noise ratio, motion blur, and synchronization capability.  We find that only cooled FLIRs will enable stereo vision performance that meets the goals of the Demo III program for nighttime autonomous mobility.  (Author abstract) 10 Refs.

Title: Social potentials for scalable multi-robot formations
Abstract: Potential function approaches to robot navigation provide an elegant paradigm for expressing multiple constraints and goals in mobile robot navigation problems.  As an example, a simple reactive navigation strategy can be generated by combining repulsion from obstacles with attraction to a goal.  Advantages of this approach can also be extended to multi-robot teams.  In this paper we present a new class of potential functions for multiple robots that enables homogeneous large-scale robot teams to arrange themselves in geometric formations while navigating to a goal location through an obstacle field.  The approach is inspired by the way molecules 'snap' into place as they form crystals; the robots are drawn to particular 'attachment sites' positioned with respect to other robots.  We refer to these potential functions as 'social potentials' because they are constructed with respect to other agents.  Initial results, generated in simulation, illustrate the viability of the approach.  (Author abstract) 18 Refs.

Title: Motion planning for dynamic eel-like robots
Abstract: We investigate basic issues of motion planning for a class of dynamic mobile robots, focusing on eel-like swimming robots.  A primary characteristic of this class of robots is that drift plays a significant role in the generation of motion.  We build on previous work in which we explored generic gait patterns that could be used to drive an eel-like robot.  We make an analogy with kinematic car-like robots to develop a nominal path from an initial state to a good state, and then develop feedback algorithms to perform trajectory tracking around this nominal path.  We also address the central issues that arise when using cyclic gaits as the basis for control strategies.  (Author abstract) 17 Refs.

Title: 3D motion tracking of a mobile robot in a natural environment
Abstract: This paper presents a vision-based tracking system suitable for autonomous robot vehicle guidance.  The system includes a head with three on-board CCD cameras, which can be mounted anywhere on a mobile vehicle.  By processing consecutive trinocular sets of precisely aligned and rectified images, the local 3D trajectory of the vehicle in an unstructured environment can be tracked.  First, a 3D representation of stable features in the image scene is generated using a stereo algorithm.  Second, motion is estimated by tracking matched features over time.  The motion equation with 6-DOF is then solved using an iterative least squares fit algorithm.  Finally, a Kalman filter implementation is used to optimize the world representation of scene features.

Title: Pursuit-evasion using beam detection
Abstract: We present an algorithm for searching a 2D environment for unpredictable moving targets using only beam-based detection.  One or more pursuers move along the environment boundary, and carry a rotating beam that detects evaders.  The beam could correspond in practice to a laser or a camera.  The task is to compute motions for pursuers and their beams that ensure that all evaders will be detected.  For a 2D polygonal environment, we solve a long-standing open problem by presenting a complete O(n**3)-time algorithm that is guaranteed to find a successful motion strategy for a single pursuer and its beam, if a solution exists.  This algorithm is extended to the case of coordinating multiple pursuers, but the number of pursuers used in a solution is not necessarily optimal.  An implementation is presented, and several computed examples are shown.  (Author abstract) 15 Refs.

Title: Landmark selection for terrain matching
Abstract: We describe techniques to optimally select landmarks in order to perform mobile robot localization by matching terrain maps.  The method is based upon a maximum-likelihood robot localization algorithm that efficiently searches the space of possible robot positions.  We use a sensor error model to estimate the probability distribution of the terrain expected to be seen from the current robot position.  The estimated distribution is compared to a previously generated map of the terrain and the optimal landmark is selected by minimizing the predicted uncertainty in the localization.  This approach can be used to generate a sensor uncertainty field for use by the robot's planning component.  Experiments indicate that landmark selection improves not only the localization uncertainty, but also the likelihood of success.  (Author abstract) 14 Refs.

Title: Integration of range and image sensing for photorealistic 3D modeling
Abstract: The automated extraction of photorealistic 3-D models of the world that can be used in applications such as virtual reality, tele-presence, digital cinematography and urban planning, is the focus of this paper.  The combination of range (dense depth estimates) and image sensing (color information) provides data-sets which allow us to create photorealistic models of high quality.  The challenges are the simplification of the 3-D data set, the extraction of meaningful features in both the range and 2-D images and the fusion of those data-sets using the extracted features.  We address all these challenges and provide results on data we gathered in outdoor scenes by a range and image sensor based on a mobile robot.  Our ultimate goal is an autonomous 3-D model creation system which minimizes the amount of human interaction.  (Author abstract) 20 Refs.

The rehabilitation for the patient who have problems on the jaw joint, mastication muscles, and other organs concerning the food chewing have been done primarily based on the doctor's technique.  Conventional mouth opening apparatuses (such as wooden screws, bite blocks and clothespins-type apparatus) only increases mouth opening distance and do not have actuators, sensors, and/or control systems.  Moreover, during therapy, the quantitative force data is unknown in spite of its importance for the standardization of mouth opening and closing training.  Mouth opening and closing training robot WY-5 (Waseda Yamanashi No. 5) consists of mechanical, actuation, sensor, and control systems.  As a result of therapy using WY-5, the mouth opening distance increased.  (Author abstract) 4 Refs.

Title: Localization method based on two omnidirectional perception systems cooperation
Abstract: This paper deals with an absolute localization paradigm based on the cooperation of an omnidirectional vision system and a low cost panoramic range finder system.  These two perception systems used independently by our laboratory provide some complementary data.  This association permits us to build a robust sensorial model which integrates an important number of significant primitives.  The obtained sensorial model allows to realize an absolute localization of the mobile robot in particular configurations where it is not possible to determine the position with the use of one of the two sensors.  In a first part we present our global perception system.  In a second part we deal with our sensorial model building approach, and finally we present an absolute localization method which uses a Dempster-Shafer approach.  We analyze the performance of our global absolute localization system on several robot's elementary moves, in an indoor environment.  (Author abstract) 13 Refs.

For a number of simple motions, it is shown experimentally that the model agrees well with the results.  Methods were developed for planning feasible, minimum time and minimum energy trajectories for the robot.  These methods are illustrated both by mathematical simulation and hardware experiments.

Title: Recent progress in local and global traversability for planetary rovers
Abstract: Autonomous planetary rovers operating in vast unknown environments must operate efficiently because of size, power and computing limitations.  Recently, we have developed a rover capable of efficient obstacle avoidance and path planning.  The rover uses binocular stereo vision to sense potentially cluttered outdoor environments.  Navigation is performed by a combination of several modules that each 'vote' for the next best action for the robot to execute.  The key distinction of our system is that it produces globally intelligent behavior with a small computational resource - all processing and decision making is done on a single processor.  These algorithms have been tested on our prototype rover, Bullwinkle, outdoors and have recently driven the rover 100 m at speeds of 15 cm/sec.  In this paper we report on the extensions on the systems that we have previously developed that were necessary to achieve autonomous navigation in this domain.  (Author abstract) 20 Refs.

Title: On-board real-time state and fault identification for rovers
Abstract: For extended autonomous operation, rovers must identify potential faults to determine whether its execution needs to be halted or not.  At the same time, rovers present particular challenges for state estimation techniques: they are subject to environmental influences that affect sensor readings during normal and anomalous operation, and the sensors fluctuate rapidly both because of noise and because of the dynamics of the rover's interaction with its environment.  This paper presents MAKSI, an on-board method for state estimation and fault diagnosis that is particularly appropriate for rovers.  The method is based on a combination of continuous state estimation, using Kalman filters, and discrete state estimation, using a Markov-model representation.  (Author abstract) 10 Refs.

Title: Using multiple Gaussian hypotheses to represent probability distributions for mobile robot localization
Abstract: A new mobile robot localization technique is presented which uses multiple Gaussian hypotheses to represent the probability distribution of the robots location in the environment.  Sensor data is assumed to be provided in the form of a Gaussian distribution over the space of robot poses.  A tree of hypotheses is built, representing the possible data association histories for the system.  Covariance intersection is used for the fusion of the Gaussians whenever a data association decision is taken.  However, such a tree can grow without bound and so rules are introduced for the elimination of the least likely hypotheses from the tree and for the proper re-distribution of their probabilities.  This technique is applied to a feature-based mobile robot localization scheme and experimental results are given demonstrating the effectiveness of the scheme.  (Author abstract) 10 Refs.

Title: Randomized planning for short inspection paths
Abstract: This paper addresses the following inspection problem: given a known workspace and a robot with vision capabilities compute a short path path for the robot such that each point on boundary of the workspace is visible from some point on the path.  Autonomous inspection, such as by a flying camera, or a virtual reality architectural walkthrough, could be guided by a solution to the above inspection problem.  Visibility constraints on both maximum viewing distance and maximum angle of incidence are considered to better model real sensors.  An algorithm is presented for planar workspaces which operates in two steps: selecting art gallery-style guards and connecting them to form an inspection path.  Experimental results for this algorithm are discussed.  Next, the algorithm is extended to three dimensions and inspection paths are shown.  (Author abstract) 15 Refs.

Title: Fuzzy control of quadrupedal running
Abstract: In this paper, a new fuzzy systems approach to the control of quadrupedal running is presented.  The fuzzy controller is capable of learning the necessary leg touchdown angles and leg thrusts required to track the desired running height and velocity of a bounding quadruped in only one stride.  This is accomplished through an adaptation mechanism which is based on heuristics similar to those used by Raibert to design his controllers.  The performance of the fuzzy controller is compared to that of a modified Raibert controller and shows better tracking characteristics.  The fuzzy controller's ability to respond to significant modeling errors in the quadruped is demonstrated with an example.  (Author abstract) 23 Refs.

Title: Motion analysis and experiments of passive walking robot QUARTET II
Abstract: In this paper, passive walking of the eight-legged robot QUARTET II that has simple straight legs, and is also constrained to have two degrees of freedom for the simplicity of its motion, is described.  The legged robot can continue to walk down a slight slope steadily without any actuation if appropriate initial conditions are given.  Since no control input except for gravitational torque is applied to the robot, more natural gaits compared with those of conventional actuated walking robots are expected.  In walking simulation, trajectory stability and bifurcation that occurs along with the increase of slope angle and finally leads to chaotic gait are discussed.  In walking experiment, some kind of trajectory stability and bifurcation can be observed.  (Author abstract) 6 Refs.

Title: Collective localization: a distributed Kalman filter approach to localization of groups of mobile robots
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to the cooperative localization problem, namely collective localization.  A group of M robots is viewed as a single system composed of robots that carry, in general, different sensors and have different positioning capabilities.  A single Kalman filter is formulated to estimate the position and orientation of all the members of the group.  This centralized schema is capable of fusing information provided by the sensors distributed on the individual robots while accommodating independencies and interdependencies among the collected data.  In order to allow for distributed processing, the equations of the centralized Kalman filter are treated so that this filter can be decomposed in M modified Kalman filters each running on a separate robot.  The collective localization algorithm is applied to a group of 3 robots and the improvement in localization accuracy is presented.  (Author abstract) 23 Refs.

Title: Control of a nonholonomic system with a drift term
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of the 3-state and 2-input affine nonholonomic systems with a drift term.  Firstly, we propose an expanded chained form which is expressed as the summation of the drift term and the chained form, and the controller design method based on it.  Secondly, we propose the coordinate and input transformation algorithm which converts an affine system with a drift term into the time-state control form, and propose the controller design method using the exact linearization.  Finally, an asteroid sample-return robot with nonzero initial angular momentum is considered as an example.  By using the transformation algorithm, we obtain the time-state control form for the robot.  The attitude controller of the robot is designed on the basis of the time-state control form, and simulation has been carried out.  (Author abstract) 8 Refs.

Title: Leaping maneuver for a brachiating robot
Abstract: We report on a control strategy for the 'leap' problem arising from an ape's fast brachiation when the next branch is far out of reach and the task involves a significant component of free flight as well as swing motion.  In the swing phase, good regulation of velocity and angular momentum for lift-off to aim at the target bar is required.  In the flight phase, control of the posture and rotation of the body is important to catch the bar.  We propose a control strategy to achieve such a dynamic maneuver for a two degrees of freedom brachiating robot.  Numerical simulations suggest that the proposed strategy achieves the desired leaping maneuver.  (Author abstract) 14 Refs.

Title: Motion planning and trajectory control of an underactuated three-link robot via dynamic feedback linearization
Abstract: We present a new method for motion planning and feedback control of three-link planar robot arms with a passive rotational third joint.  These underactuated mechanical systems are shown to be fully linearizable and input-output decoupable by means of a nonlinear dynamic feedback, provided a physical singularity is avoided.  The linearizing output is the position of the so-called center of percussion of the third link.  Based on this result, one can plan smooth motions joining in finite time any initial and desired final state of the robot.  Moreover, it is easy to design an exponentially stabilizing feedback along the planned trajectory.  Simulation results are reported for a 3R robot.  (Author abstract) 14 Refs.

Title: Decentralized approach to elementary formation maneuvers
Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized formation control (the coupled dynamics approach) for executing Elementary Formation Maneuvers (EFM) for Hilare-type mobile robots.  The concept of an EFM is presented.  It is then shown that each of these EFMs possesses a common mathematical structure and thus may be executed by the same type of robot control.  We present two EFM controls in this paper.  The first puts feedback on the relative motion and the global motion of each robot.  The second control adds inter-robot damping.   The key advantage of our approach is reduced communication among robots and the formation obtains certain robustness properties not available to other formation controls.  We present simulation and hardware results for each of these controls.  (Author abstract) 13 Refs.

Title: Recursive dimension-growing method for computing robotic manipulability polytope
Abstract: In this paper, the general problem of mapping an n-dimensional polytope Q to an m-dimensional polytope P by P equals AQ with n greater than m is studied.  It is well-known that some vertices of Q are mapped to internal points of P, and it is very time consuming to detect them when their number is large.  A computationally efficient recursive algorithm based on dimension-growing has been developed which is capable of successively removing the internal points of each intermediate polytope when they are first detected, hence eliminating their further growth into additional internal points in subsequent intermediate polytopes.  The method can be applied to compute the robotic manipulability polytope.  It is shown that substantial reduction in computation time can be achieved for higher DOF redundant robot manipulators.  Examples including the 8 DOF ARMII robot have been presented and comparisons to the conventional method have been made.  (Edited author abstract) 10 Refs.

Title: Feature based condensation for mobile robot localization
Abstract: Much attention has been given to Condensation methods for mobile robot localization.  This has resulted in somewhat of a breakthrough in representing uncertainty for mobile robots.  In this paper we use Condensation with planned sampling as a tool for doing feature based global localization in a large and semi-structured environment.  This paper presents a comparison of four different feature types: sonar based triangulation points and point pairs, as well as lines and doors extracted using a laser scanner.  We show experimental results that highlight the information content of the different features, and point to fruitful combinations.  Accuracy, computation time and the ability to narrow down the search space are among the measures used to compare the features.  From the comparison of features, some general guidelines are drawn for determining good feature types.  (Author abstract) 11 Refs.

Title: Improving the accuracy of dynamic localization systems using RTK GPS by identifying the GPS latency
Abstract: For precise localization of outdoor mobile robots, Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK GPS) has obvious advantages: position data are given with centimeter-accuracy, and the required infrastructure is reduced to a sole fixed reference station.  Yet, the use of this solution arises a number of issues, such as satellite maskings, or the existence of the so-called GPS latency which delays the output of the localization data.  This paper deals with the latter problem, and proposes a method to identify this parameter without using other external sensors.  Experimental results carried out with the robot MELODY are presented so as to validate our solution.  (Author abstract) 9 Refs.

Title: Kinematics for redundantly actuated omni-directional mobile robots
Abstract: Omni-directional mobile robots have been popularly employed in several application areas.  However, the kinematics for these systems have not been clearly identified, specially for redundantly actuated case which is common in omni-directional mobile robot such as Nomadic model.  For such mobile robot systems, exploitation of redundant actuation as well as singularity analysis has not been extensively addressed.  In light of this fact, this paper introduces two different kinematic approaches for omni-directional mobile robots and examine singularity configurations of such systems.  Then, a singular-free load distribution scheme for a redundantly actuated three-wheeled omni-directional mobile robot is proposed.  Through simulation, several advantages of redundantly actuated mobile robot in aspect of singularity avoidance and exploiting several subtasks are presented.  (Author abstract) 23 Refs.

Title: Precision-calibration of fiber-optics gyroscopes for mobile robot navigation
Abstract: Fiber-optics gyroscopes ('gyros') are gaining importance as a means for improving dead-reckoning accuracy in mobile robots.  In the past, the relatively high drift rate of moderately priced gyros presented the foremost technical limitation of these devices.  More recently, fiber-optics gyros with very low drift rates have become available and affordable.  Because of their low drift rate attention is warranted to sources of errors that were previously considered as of secondary importance.  In the KVH E-Core RD2100 gyros that were examined at our lab we found that the non-linearity of the scale-factor and temperature dependency caused significant errors.  A calibration method, described in this paper, reduces the resulting errors by one order of magnitude.  (Author abstract) 10 Refs.

Title: Landmark-based safe path planning for car-like robots
Abstract: This paper addresses path planning with uncertainty for a car-like robot subject to configuration uncertainty.  The robot estimates its configuration with odometry and an absolute localization device based on environmental feature matching.  The issue is to compute safe paths that guarantee that the goal will be reached in spite of the uncertainty.  The solution proposed relies upon the automatic construction of a set of landmarks characterized by (1) a region of the configuration space, (2) the 'best' features for localization in this region, and (3) a perception uncertainty field that measures how well a feature is perceived at each configuration in the region.  The landmarks are used within an efficient roodmap-based path planning algorithm that returns a safe motion plan that alternates motion along safe paths and localization operations.

Title: Behavior coordination and its modification on brachiation-type mobile robot
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel adaptation method for a behavior-based locomotion robot.  Utilization of behavior-based controller makes the controller designing process easier and shorter, because the designer can deal with behavior controllers for simple behaviors independently, and after that can coordinate those behavior controllers in order for a robot to achieve the objective complex behavior.  Some problems are still remaining.  One is how to adjust the total behavior when the target task or environment is changed.  We propose the novel method to adjust the behavior coordinator against some changes.  This method adjusts the activation level of each behavior controller for the changes in less number of trials.  It is applied to the real brachiation robot control.  The brachiation robot has a redundant mechanism to locomote from branch to branch like a long-armed ape.  (Author abstract) 9 Refs.

Title: Balancing of an inverted pendulum with a redundant direct-drive robot
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of stabilizing a base-excited inverted pendulum around its upright position with a robot.  The pendulum has two rotational degrees of freedom and its base point is moved in two-dimensional space by a planar direct-drive robot.  The robot has three degrees of freedom and its kinematic redundancy occurring at the inverse kinematics is utilized to optimize the joint acceleration and the manipulability measure.  A decentralized joint acceleration control with a software velocity/acceleration observer, is used to accelerate/decelerate each joint of the robot to balance the pendulum.  Experimental results are described to show the stable and robust responses of the control system.  (Author abstract) 9 Refs.

Title: Approximating a single viewpoint in panoramic imaging devices
Abstract: Panoramic cameras, which image a very large field of view, are useful devices for mobile robots that must move rapidly and securely in their environments.  Recent panoramic cameras present a very wide field of view from a single viewpoint.  A single viewpoint is useful in mobile robotics for a number of reasons, including perspective reprojection and stereo analysis.  However, the requirement of single viewpoint for panoramic cameras restricts the optical and geometrical design of these devices.  In this paper we present a method for approximating a single viewpoint in panoramic devices that allows much greater freedom in design.  We illustrate the method with a compact catadioptric device using a spherical mirror and standard optics, and apply it to perspective reprojection.  The resultant panoramic camera has been integrated as a surveillance device on a small mobile robot.  (Author abstract) 12 Refs.

Title: Fusion of omni-directional sonar and omni-directional vision for environment recognition of mobile robots
Abstract: This paper propose a new method of sensor fusion of an omni-directional ultrasonic sensor and an omni-directional vision sensor.  A new omni-directional sonar, which we developed, can measure accurate distance and direction of reflecting points, and an omni-directional vision can give direction to edges of segment.  We propose a sensor fusion method using both the reflecting points measured by the sonar and the edges of segment measured by the vision, based on the angles.  Those data are different in character, so they compensate each other in the proposed method, and it becomes possible to get better information which are useful for environment recognition of mobile robots.  We describe the proposed method and an experimental result to show its potential.  (Author abstract) 8 Refs.

Title: Learning globally consistent maps by relaxation
Abstract: Mobile robots require the ability to build their own maps to operate in unknown environments.  A fundamental problem is that odometry-based dead reckoning cannot be used to assign accurate global position information to a map because of drift errors caused by wheel slippage.  This paper introduces a fast, on-line method of learning globally consistent maps, using only local metric information.  The approach differs from previous work in that it is computationally cheap, easy to implement and is guaranteed to find a globally optimal solution.  Experiments are presented in which large, complex environments were successfully mapped by a real robot, and quantitative performance measures are used to assess the quality of the maps obtained.

Title: Feature extraction for autonomous navigation using an active sonar head
Abstract: A critical problem in sensory interpretation is the derivation of the right mapping between sensor signals and properties of the world.  In this regard, the method proposed here uses active sensing to acquire environmental features for reliable navigation in indoor environments.  The features utilized are lines, corners, and edges extracted from common indoor room features such as walls, room corners and room edges, respectively.  These features are abundant in indoor environments and allow for closed-form location estimates from time-of-flight sonar information.  Subsequently, a multiple hypothesis testing procedure is utilized to accurately localize and identify those features.  Experiments using a new active sonar system, implemented using a 3 DOF binaural sonar head, shows that the system is able to correctly localize and identify indoor environmental features, and that active sensing strategies based on sensor reconfiguration makes the process of feature extraction more accurate.

Title: Optimal motion planning in the image plane for mobile robots
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to image-based visual servoing by making motion plans directly in the image plane.  By skipping the step of transferring image features back to robot pose, we are able to utilize the image features for a direct and fast motion planning solution.  Standard visual servoing techniques can then be applied to track the given trajectory.  In this paper, we have applied the idea to 2-D and 3-D (kinematic) motion planning and discussed the mechanisms for taking advantage of surplus features and incorporating other image-based constraints, such as that the targets always remain in the field of view.

Title: Mobile robot self-localization using PDAB
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to make a contribution to the mobile robot self-localization problem, when the initial position is unknown.  It is assumed that a simple map of the environment, consisting of a list of 2D-edge coordinates is available.  These are regarded as natural or artificial landmarks.  It is further assumed that the position of edges can be detected by a sensor in the local coordinate frame of the robot.  From every pair of feature measures and map-landmarks, hypotheses of the robot-pose are constructed.  These are regarded as measurement inputs into the PDAB approach.  The presented first results demonstrates that the suggested method in combination with low level features is a promising approach for self-localization in non-structured and sparse modeled environments.

Title: Civil-engineering articulated vehicle localization: solutions to deal with GPS masking phases
Abstract: In order to equip the compactors dedicated to road construction with an operator aiding system, a localization system using Real-Time Kinematic GPS is considered.  This paper presents the solutions we have developed to maintain an acceptable precision of the vehicle positioning even during the satellite masking phases.  By combining a gyro with steering angle and speed measurements, we show that it is possible to obtain satisfying performances in dead reckoning navigation with a low-cost equipment.  A forward-backward Kalman filter is proposed to deal with particularly long maskings, which typically occur when the compactor works under bridges.  Experimental results carried out in the framework of a cooperation with the Laboratoire Central des Ponts et Chaussees (LCPC) and the Centre d'Experimentations Routieres (CER) are presented to validate the proposed solutions.

Title: Practical mobile robot self-localization
Abstract: A mapmaking robot integrates accumulated sensor data into a data structure that can be used for future localization or planning operations.  Localization is the process of determining the robot's location within its environment.  This paper describes experiments in which a robot simultaneously makes a map and localizes to that map.  The map is a collection of tangent vectors constructed from stored sonar readings localized to a series of estimated poses.  The vectors retain sensed surface normal information to improve accuracy.  The localization scheme is a Hough transform into a space described by the robot's current sonar scan.  The Hough transform finds a best fit in the presence of both sporadic sensor noise and discretization error.  (Author abstract) 25 Refs.

Title: Balance control of a biped robot combining off-line pattern with real-time modification
Abstract: Since a biped robot tends to tip over easily, stable and reliable biped walking is a very important achievement.  In this paper, we propose a balance control method based on an off-line planned walking pattern with real-time modification.  First, a method of generating a highly stable, smooth walking pattern is presented.  Then, a method of real-time modification consisting of body posture control, actual ZMP control and landing time control based sensor information is proposed.  By combining the proposed off-line walking pattern with real-time modification, the biped robot can walk smoothly and adapt to unknown environments.  The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by dynamic simulator such as walking on unexpected irregular rough terrain, soft ground and in environments in the presence of disturbances.

Title: BERRA: a research architecture for service robots
Abstract: The architecture for a mobile service robot is discussed.  The paper covers aspects related to overall design and implementation.  The robot architecture is of the hybrid deliberative/reactive behavioral type.  The strategy is selection where planning is viewed as configuration.  The architecture can be divided into three layers, one for deliberation, one for task execution, and one reactive layer.  Scalability and a high degree of flexibility have been primary design goals, making it easy to reconfigure the system.  The system has been built in an object oriented fashion.  An application of the architecture has been tested in a significant number of missions in our lab, where one room has been setup as an ordinary living room.  (Author abstract) 12 Refs.

Title: Responding to affordances: learning and projecting a sensorimotor mapping
Abstract: An important aim of robotics is to design and build machines that can recognize and exploit opportunities afforded by new situations.  Traditionally in artificial intelligence, this task has fallen on abstract representations, but that has left the problem of how to ground the representations in sensorimotor activity.  This paper proposes a computational architecture whereby a mobile robot internalizes representations based on its experience.  Section 2 examines a fast on-line learning algorithm that allows the robot to build up a mapping of how its motor signals transform sensory data.  Section 3 proposes a way of categorizing object affordances according to their internal effects.  Based on these effects, wavelet analysis is applied to sensory data to uncover invariance, thus abstracting a representation of goals.  Section 4 explores heuristics for projecting a learned sensorimotor mapping into the future to attain these goals.  (Author abstract) 22 Refs.

Title: Evolutionary trajectory learning for autonomous robots by means of geometric approximations of polygonal obstacles
Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of flexible geometric approximations of polygonal obstacles for Intelligent Autonomous Robot (IAR) navigation which is the extension of our previous work.  The trajectory learning problem for IAR navigation is formulated as a constrained discrete-time-optimal control problem where the polygonal obstacles are the constraints.  From the visibility and sensor modeling concepts, polygonal obstacles within the environment are approximated as either by circles or by ellipses depending on the shape and size of them.  Furthermore, some practical issues are identified and resolved through these type of approximations.  The effectiveness of these methods is illustrated by some simulations of the robot within a heavily obstacle environment.  (Author abstract) 15 Refs.

Title: Solving credit assignment problem in behavior coordination learning via robot action decomposition
Abstract: In behavior coordination, several primitive behaviors are 'combined' to generate a resultant action to drive the robot.  The weights across the primitive behaviors should be properly determined according to the situations that the robot encounters in order to successfully avoid collisions with obstacles and accomplish the assigned task.  Behavior coordination learning is proposed to learn the mapping between the situations encountered by the robot and the weight combinations on primitive behaviors from observed resultant behavior of the robot.  This paper proposes an action decomposition algorithm to automatically derive the weights across primitive behaviors from an observed resultants behavior with minimum weight variations along time by local optimization scheme.  Several examples on simulated and experimental data are presented to demonstrate the computation in action decomposition.  (Author abstract) 11 Refs.

Title: Design policy of Intelligent Space
Abstract: Intelligent spaces are rooms or areas that are equipped with sensors which enable the spaces to perceive and understand what is happening in them.  Intelligent Spaces are expected to have a broad range of applications such in homes, offices, factories etc. Intelligent Space is a kind of intelligent environments.  The motivation of building intelligent environment is to realize convenient and active environments which have been passive.  Intelligent Space is a space which supports both human and robots.  In this paper, we explain our design policy of Intelligent Space.  Since this system is deeply related with real world, we should be careful on its design.  We discuss how we selected its elements and what we want to realize.  Some applications of Intelligent Space are shown.  (Author abstract) 10 Refs.

Title: Inverse learning-based heterogeneous fuzzy data fusion for hybrid intelligent control
Abstract: In order to make the most use of the Heterogeneous Fuzzy Data (HFD) available for Hybrid Intelligent Controller (HIC) design, we classify the HFD into four categories: direct data (DD), direct rules (DR), indirect data (ID) and indirect rules (IR).  Based on inverse learning, we convert the ID, IR, DD, and DR into a uniform domain, therefore some data fusion theory can be used to integrate HFD with direct and indirect forms.  Some conjunctive (T-norms), disjunctive (T-conorms) and compromise (mean) fusion operators have been selected and compared for above proposed HFD fusion methods.  The validity of the proposed methods is verified through hybrid intelligent control of a biped walking robot.  The simulation results show that the gait can be improved by the proposed inverse learning-based HFD fusion methods.  (Author abstract) 14 Refs.

Title: Adaptive role development in a homogeneous connected robot group
Abstract: A distributed autonomous approach to adaptive system design is investigated through Cooperative Carrying Problem (CCP), in which a homogeneous group of autonomous moving robots have to cooperate in carrying a load.  A robot's action generator is designed using two Reinforcement Learning (RL) units in order to cope with the dynamics in CCP.  The employed strategy is that each robot is learning its behavior as it were in a static environment, by expanding the state space of the main RL unit using the prediction information of the nearest future that is generated by the supplementary RL unit.  Computer simulations with two robots are conducted in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  The cooperative behaviors, which is adaptive role development, through autonomous task decomposition is observed in the achieved stable behavior.  (Author abstract) 13 Refs.

Title: Reduction of the gap between simulated and real environments in evolutionary robotics: a dynamically-rearranging neural network approach
Abstract: Recently, the Evolutionary Robotics approach has been attracting a lot of concern in robotics and artificial life communities.  In this approach, neural networks are widely used to construct controllers for autonomous mobile agents, since they intrinsically have nonlinear mapping, generalization, noise-tolerant abilities and so on.  However, the followings are still open questions: 1) the gap between simulated and real environments, 2) the evolutionary and learning phase are completely separated, and 3) the conflict between stability and evolvability/adaptability.  In this paper, we particularly focus on the gap problem, and try to alleviate this by incorporating the concept of dynamic rearrangement function of biological neural networks with the use of neuromodulators.  Simulation and real experimental results show that the proposed approach is highly promising.  (Author abstract) 12 Refs.

Title: Multi-limbed robot in multi-point contact
Abstract: This paper discusses statics and kinematics of a multi-limbed robot in contact with the ground at multiple points.  Contact at multiple points causes the indeterminacy of the contact force.  The motion of the robot is constrained to maintain contact.  We show that the robot has singular postures at which it has an additional degree of freedom and that the singularity also causes the indeterminacy of the contact force.  The sliding motion of the robot is also constrained when the contact force is indeterminate.  The relationship between the sliding constraint and the singularity is presented.  We developed a quadruped robot which can take various postures, e.g. lying on the ground and standing on the knees.  The motion of the quadruped robot is analyzed as an example of a multi-limbed robot.  (Author abstract) 7 Refs.

Abstract: This paper investigates control strategies for nonholonomic mechanical systems subject to various constraints.  At first, for driftless systems which are transformable to chained forms, we will compare three existing strategies including time-state based controller being proposed by the authors.  They will be mainly examined through an application to a well-known wheeled vehicle system; numerical simulations will help to see their practical advantages and drawbacks.  Secondly, we will describe a ball-and-plane problem which is not transformable to chained form and propose a feedback type strategy for it by modifying time-state-control form based controller.  Thirdly, we will deal with a control problem of flying object with non-zero initial angular momentum, which is modeled as state equation with drift term and no configurations of which are equilibria.  We also-propose a feedback controller via time-varying coordinate transformation by constructing an appropriate problem formulation.  (Author abstract) 18 Refs.

Abstract: This paper deals with a task-assignment method for cooperative transportation by multiple mobile robots in an open and dynamic area.  The problem can be divided into three parts: the dynamic change of tasks, the dynamic change of the robot team composition, and the level of difficulty in finding the optimal solution.  The authors propose the following approach: (1) By inputting sensor information to a 'Task Template' and a 'Task-interaction Template,' tasks will be dynamically generated; (2) The planner consists of two parts, the Task-assignment Planner and the Motion Planner (the latter is made independently for each task); (3) The task-assignment problem is solved by using a linear programming method based on the execution priority described in the 'Task Templates.' The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a cooperative transport simulation.  (Author abstract) 12 Refs.

Title: Sensor fusion of odometry and sonar sensors by the Gaussian Mixture Bayes' technique in mobile robot position estimation
Abstract: Modelling and reducing uncertainty are two essential problems with mobile robot localisation.  Previously we developed a robot localisation system, namely the Gaussian Mixture of Bayes with Regularised Expectation Maximisation (GMB-REM), using sonar sensors.  GMB-REM allows a robot's position to be modelled as a probability distribution, and uses Bayes' theorem to reduce the uncertainty of its location.  In this paper, a new system for performing sensor fusion is introduced, namely an enhanced form of GMB-REM.  Empirical results show the new system outperforms GMB-REM using sonar alone.  More specifically, it is able to constrain the error of robot's positions even when sonar signals are noisy.  (Author abstract) 19 Refs.

Title: Positioning system using the digital mark pattern
Abstract: We proposed a self-positioning system of an autonomous mobile robot using a digital mark pattern and a CCD camera [1] .  The mark pattern is put on the ceiling as a landmark.  The Grey codes are written around this mark pattern.  The CCD camera is put on the mobile robot to read codes on the mark pattern.  In this system, the horizontal distance from the ceiling mark pattern is measured using the tilt angle of the CCD camera.  The problem is leaned camera platform.  To improve this problem, we propose a method of measurement of the horizontal distance using the mark pattern image which is captured by CCD camera.  The length and the width ratio of the mark pattern image depend on horizontal distance.  Thus, the horizontal distance can be calculated by using the ratio between the length and the width of the mark pattern image.  (Author abstract) 3 Refs.

Title: Mobile robot motion planning considering the motion uncertainty of moving obstacles
Abstract: This paper proposes a motion planning method for a mobile robot in the situation where there are both static and moving obstacles.  If the robot cannot communicate with moving obstacles, it has to predict their future movement in order to plan the safe and efficient motion.  Since such a prediction includes uncertainty, the proposed method explicitly considers the uncertainty in motion planning.  We use a probabilistic model of the uncertainty and select the motion which minimizes the expected time of reaching the destination.  We also utilize the knowledge of possible paths of moving obstacles, which is applicable to usual structured environments.  Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the method.

Title: Automatic map generation with mobile robot
Abstract: In this paper, a method is described which a mobile robot acquires an environment map by walking around the given environment for itself.  The mobile robot in this paper is able to translate and rotate and has 3 DOF with respect to the x and y coordinates and the rotational angle around the z axis.  And it is equipped with a laser range sensor, ultrasonic wave sensors, infrared radiation sensors and contact sensors.  Every time it moves, the displacement error is accumulated, so a map generated becomes incorrect with the influence of the error.  The method is proposed in which the displacement error is revised and a correct map is acquired exploiting a laser range sensor.  And the method for the generation of locus and the running control of the mobile robot referring to the map acquired are also proposed.  (Author abstract) 6 Refs.

Title: Application of reinforcement learning to balancing of acrobot
Abstract: The acrobot is a two-link robot, actuated only at the joint between the two links.  It is one of difficult tasks in reinforcement learning (RL) to control the acrobot because it has nonlinear dynamics and continuous state and action spaces.  In this article, we discuss applying the RL to the task of balancing control of the acrobot.  Our RL method has an architecture similar to the actor-critic.  The actor and the critic are approximated by normalized Gaussian networks, which are trained by an on-line EM algorithm.  We also introduce eligibility traces for our actor-critic architecture.  Our computer simulation shows that our method is able to achieve fairly good control with a small number of trials.  (Author abstract) 12 Refs.

Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning method based on memorizing and retrieving episodes of the learner's own experiences.  The results of the computer simulation on a simple but typical non-Markovian environment is shown to clarify the performance.  An instance-based reinforcement learning method previously proposed by an author is also based on the learner's experiences memorized without any modification.  But it is applicable only to Markovian domain where it is enough for the learner to acquire a reactive policy to achieve the optimal behavior.  An episode-based method is not only overcome a perceptual aliasing but also inherit the advantages of instance-based method on flexibility for applicable domain.  (Author abstract) 12 Refs.

Title: Application of orthogonal ultrasonic signals and binaural processing for imaging of the environment
Abstract: Data acquisition rates in ultrasonic imaging systems are limited the finite value of the speed of ultrasonic waves.  In order to improve the imaging speed, it is proposed to perform simultaneous scanning of the environment in different directions.  In order to avoid cross-talk between adjacent channels in different directions, different orthogonal signals are transmitted.  Application of cross-correlation processing and non-linear iterative deconvolution enables the reliable separation of signals transmitted by different sources and reflected by multiple targets.  The spatial positions of the targets are found using the data obtained after the non-linear deconvolution as the initial data for binaural or tri-aural processing.  This approach has been exploited in ultrasonic sonar used for navigation of mobile robots.  (Author abstract) 8 Refs.

Title: Using real-time stereo vision for mobile robot navigation
Abstract: This paper describes a working vision-based mobile robot that navigates and autonomously explores its environment while building occupancy grid maps of the environment.  We present a method for reducing stereo vision disparity images to two-dimensional map information.  Stereo vision has several attributes that set it apart from other sensors more commonly used for occupancy grid mapping.  We discuss these attributes, the errors that some of them create, and how to overcome them.  We reduce errors by segmenting disparity images based on continuous disparity surfaces to reject 'spikes' caused by stereo mismatches.  Stereo vision processing and map updates are done at 5 Hz and the robot moves at speeds of 300 cm/s.  (Author abstract) 21 Refs.
