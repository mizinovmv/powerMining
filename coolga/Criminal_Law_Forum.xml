defence lawyers in the pre-trial criminal Process</title><content>recent years have seen an intermittent debate amongst journalists, policy-makers and academics in adversarial jurisdictions about the nature and quality of the inquisitorial tradition in criminal process. much of the political impact of the debate in britain has stemmed from the view asserted periodically by certain high profile figures that some form of judicial supervision of police investigation &amp;#x2013; as practised for example in france &amp;#x2013; might be introduced in england and wales.1 such views tend to find expression when events call into question not just particular rules but also the underlying structures and assumptions of our adversarial tradition of criminal process. thus in 1991 the public revelation of serious miscarriages of justice led to the appointment of a royal commission on criminal justice in which the adversarial character of the pre-trial process seemed to be a key point of interrogation.2 the police view, demonstrated in a number of key cases, was that once they were clear that a suspect was guilty they had no responsibility to pursue exculpatory lines of investigation. this, combined with the failure of defence lawyers to play the extensive, autonomous investigative role the adversarial system demanded of them, encouraged some to ask whether there might not be advantages in somehow ensuring that the resources and rights of the state were devoted to pursuing exonerating as well as incriminating evidence. given the limited empirical evidence then available on the workings of judicial supervision in practice4 and the sometimes vehement dispute in france itself about the future of its pre-trial process and especially the juge d''instruction(examining magistrate), the proposals were perhaps not surprisingly rejected.5 but since the mid 1990s, british funders have begun to finance a number of empirical studies of french criminal justice.6 this paper reports the principal findings of a empirical study primarily funded by britain''s economic and social research council into the role of defence lawyers in france.7 our focus and primary theme is the developing nature of their dialogue and exchanges with key state actors such as judges, prosecutors and the police on the one hand and with clients on the other. but in so doing we aim to cast light on the broader functioning of the pre-trial process in France.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Kenneth S  Gallant  </authors><title>politics, theory and institutions: three

focuses on the reasons for disaccord between the icc and the more seasoned international criminal tribunals on the issue of allowing substantive preparation of witnesses for testifying in court. the rationales behind the opposing decisions and the ensuing debate on the legitimacy and utility of witness proofing continue to be overshadowed by competition between the &amp;#8249;adversarial&amp;#8217; and the &amp;#8249;inquisitorial&amp;#8217; ideologies unfolding in the guise of policy rhetoric. the ban on witness proofing imposed by both pre-trial chamber i and trial chamber i of the icc is based on a stringent application of article 21 and the evidentiary regime in which the court's discretion to elect the applicable rules of evidence is more circumscribed than under rule 89 (b) of its counterparts. although the icc trial scheme is rather obscure, attempts to read the possibility of witness proofing into it may well reveal that the practice would be an extraneous element in the icc procedural system characterized by a different configuration of the truth-finding mandate that eschews the concept of partisan ownership of witnesses. the antipodal judicial stances on witness preparation stem from the substantial dissimilarities between the two models of international criminal procedure, and each of them may be defended both legally and in policy terms. while there is little chance of attenuating the fragmentation of international criminal practice in this area, the icc&amp;#8217;s dissent may have had positive systemic effects insofar as it emphasizes the independent value of witness familiarization and the need for enhanced judicial control over witness contact. </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Matthias J  Borgers  </authors><title>regulating and combating underground banking </title><content>in combating and regulating underground banking, a choice can be made of roughly two models, the risk model and the assimilation model. the risk model comes down to a complete prohibition of underground banking combined with an active investigation and prosecution policy. in the assimilation model, underground banking is recognised as a form of financial services but at the same time, all rules that generally apply to financial services are declared applicable to underground bankers. an effort is made simultaneously to lower the threshold of the formal banking system. the international recommendations and legislation&amp;#8212;in particular of the financial action task force and the european union&amp;#8212;take the assimilation model as their starting point, albeit that no or hardly any attention is paid to the role of the formal banking system. with that, relatively little account is taken as yet in the international community of the historic and socio-economic backgrounds of informal banking systems, their embedment in different cultures and the advantages of the services offered. </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Alex|er Zahar  </authors><title>legal aid, self-representation, and the crisis at the hague tribunal </title><content>the unfolding of the case of prosecutor v. vojislav &amp;#352;e&amp;#352;elj at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia (icty) has been dramatic and more than a little chaotic. the author argues that it is diagnostic of a broader crisis at the tribunal. as an experiment in international justice, the ad hoc tribunal model has proved to be expensive and slow, but on several points also procedurally arbitrary, intellectually unconvincing, and vulnerable to improper political considerations. these problems have attained a critical mass in &amp;#352;e&amp;#352;elj&amp;#8217;s case, as illustrated here. the accused &amp;#352;e&amp;#352;elj, an ultranationalist politician and former paramilitary leader, has vowed to bring the tribunal to its knees. he is self-represented at trial. this privilege was twice reaffirmed in 2006 by the icty appeals chamber, having been twice revoked by a bench of trial judges. in 2007, the new pre-trial judge in the case (now presiding judge), jean-claude antonetti, declared that a self-represented accused who can prove indigence is entitled to legal aid. he ordered the registrar of the tribunal to pay &amp;#352;e&amp;#352;elj&amp;#8217;s defence expenses from the tribunal&amp;#8217;s legal aid budget if &amp;#352;e&amp;#352;elj could prove his indigence. the author argues that while there is good reason to disburse legal aid funds to an indigent accused who has been granted privileges of self-representation, this entitlement was not convincingly explained by antonetti. moreover, &amp;#352;e&amp;#352;elj&amp;#8217;s destructive aims were improperly set aside by antonetti in reaching his decision on the public financing of his defence. the current situation, which represents the combined effort of the appeals chamber and antonetti, allows &amp;#352;e&amp;#352;elj to bully participants in the proceedings, issue thinly veiled threats to prospective witnesses and the public at large, and bend the trial procedure to the requirements of his political populism. the poor handling of this case by the tribunal as a whole calls into question the ad hoc tribunal model of international criminal justice.

weakness in the decision, therefore, is not that the court adopted the wrong contractual interpretation but rather that it failed frankly to address the real issue. determining the appropriate role of the court in formulating an international order in the post-cold war era is a difficult and complex problem. it raises delicate questions of foreign policy, separation of powers, and institutional competence. there are no easy answers. but the problem is not one that will&amp;#x2014;or should&amp;#x2014;go away. the issue must be debated in the courts, as well as in the political and academic

order.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Yash Vyas </authors><title>alternatives to imprisonment in Kenya</title><content>in spite of the wide variety of sentencing options available in kenya, the courts overwhelmingly choose to sanction by imprisonment. even default on the payment of a fine can lead to a prison term where extramural penal employment would at the very least be more economical and more beneficial to the community. in my view, the main purpose of penal policy is to provide an opportunity for the offender to reintegrate himself or herself into society and to rectify the damage both to the victim and to society caused by the crime. imprisonment frustrates these objectives and should be reserved for habitual serious offenders and for grave offenses that do not readily lend themselves to alternative sanctions. even in such cases, however, compensation can be ordered in addition to a prison term.settlement, restitution, and similar approaches should become routine for all minor offenses. putting primary reliance on alternative sanctions should produce considerable savings in costs and in manpower, alleviating some of the pressure now experienced by an overburdened criminal justice system. to derive the greatest benefit from alternative sanctions, we need also to review and integrate indigenous traditions of community-based dispute resolution into the statutory structure.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Grant Niemann </authors><title>Attempts</title><content>whatever the outcome of any effort to codify

Union</title><content>in light of the historical context in which the visit of the united states delegation took place, the emphasis was on the political abuse of psychiatry. it should be clear, however, that the repression of dissidents is only the most visible manifestation of a system of psychiatric control that has been, and continues to be, profoundly insensitive to human rights. although some tentative steps have been taken to subject coercive psychiatry to the rule of law, these limited initiatives have not yet become operational. implementation of the legal reforms recommended by the delegation would help to reduce the likelihood that the pattern of psychiatric repression will reemerge. but the proposed reforms have a larger purpose&amp;#x2014;to assure that the practice of psychiatry in the soviet union is properly respectful of fundamental human rights, whether or not the patients have engaged in political or religious dissent.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Warren Young </authors><title>community care as a penal sanction</title><content>the community participation model, which rests on the philosophy of reintegration, is an important trend in recent penal policy. the sentence of community care in new zealand is an illustration of that trend. however, there are lessons to be learned from the past four years. clearly, the model has its practical limits. the extent to which the community wishes to participate in the provision of penal services is undoubtedly overstated by its proponents; as a result, community involvement is unlikely to be forthcoming unless the government provides adequate funding to groups and individuals providing such services to offenders. even then, a gap is likely to remain between the rhetoric and the reality of community participation. the majority of the community care programs are bureaucratically organized, professionally staffed, and undertaken within the context of structured thera peutic regimes. they thus fall well short of the ideal of spontaneous, neighborly concern, which is such a strong part of the western ideology of community. while some programs, particularly cultural programs offered by ethnic minority groups, have involved comparatively noninstitutional and informal relationships between sponsor and offender, these are few in number and have made little impact so far on the way in which the criminal justice system deals with offenders from ethnic minority groups. in sum, there is little to distinguish the majority of programs from conventional attempts at rehabilitation. although higher levels of funding and more vigorous community development efforts by probation officers may stimulate community involvement, the new zealand experience suggests that, at least in cultures without established processes of informal care and control, the community participation model will not be the new panacea in penal policy.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Vincent Cheng Yang </authors><title>corporate crime: state-owned enterprises in China</title><content>a decade ago, the chinese leadership frankly acknowledged that the model of a fully planned economy, with its system of state-owned and state-run enterprises, was what lenin had called a bureaucratic dream. 86 today, state-owned enterprises are enjoying far more freedom to operate, and the state is trying to control them with more law and fewer plans. the use of criminal law to confront corporate crime is part of the effort to import advanced management methods from the west. nonetheless, in the context of state ownership and party leadership, the appropriateness of this approach is questionable.the company law is a new instrument to bring about fundamental changes in china's system of business organizations. these changes will help determine the scope and limits of criminal law, as applied to corporate enterprises, in the next decade. in this context, i would suggest replacing the concept ofdanwei crime with the concept of corporate or company (gongsi) crime; distinguishing thosefaren that can independently bear criminal liability from those that cannot; and clearly defining the elements of corporate offenses. corporate criminal liability is a concept applicable when the corporation not only commits the crime but also has the legal capacity to be liable in its own right. individual liability is still the sole principle applicable to a government agency, even if the crime is collectively committed.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Mark D  Cohen |  </authors><title>developments in criminal law and criminal justice</title><content>it follows from what

before trial and conviction is simply too onerous to be justified on the basis of crime control alone. the most persuasive arguments inmonsanto andcaplin &amp;amp; drysdale are those of the dissent, which relied on the centrality to the sixth amendment of the relationship of trust that is fostered in the private attorney-client relationship. the failure to honor the right to counsel of choice results, as the dissent noted, in the possibility of the socialization of criminal defense services and diminution of counsel's independence.these conclusions, of course, are statements of policy, not empirically provable propositions. major human rights instruments, as well as their interpretation by tribunals, express a policy of overwhelming and explicit commitment to the right to a fair trial, to equality of arms, to the presumption of innocence, to protection from undue government interference with chosen counsel, and to the right to counsel of choice itself. it can only be hoped that

hugo considered the death penalty to be the hallmark of barbarity. 104 international human rights law clearly contemplates abolition of the death penalty. to some extent, it has succeeded in promoting universal and imperative norms, as in the case of the prohibitions on torture and slavery. 105 with respect to the death penalty, results have been more gradual and the effort has met with more opposition. although international norms now exist prohibiting the death penalty, 106 they are not yet widely ratified. this is why international organizations dedicated to the promotion of human rights have insisted upon strict limitation of the death penalty, including its total exclusion for certain categories, such as juveniles, pregnant women, the elderly, and the insane.no treaty provision exists to exclude the insane from the death penalty. the conclusion that this prohibition represents a customary norm is an important one, with consequences not only in international law but also in domestic law since many states consider customary international law to be a part of their domestic law. wherever a court concludes that in the absence of any domestic statutory provision to the contrary, customary international human rights law prohibits execution of an insane prisoner, a small step will be taken away from the barbarism lamented by Hugo.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Michael Bohl|er </authors><title>legal advice in criminal proceedings in the federal republic of Germany</title><content>certain

control: jamaica, argentina, and Brazil</title><content>when we consider a variety of indicators concerning the disproportionate use of deadly force by police-the ratio of civilians killed to those wounded, the ratio of civilians killed to police killed, and the ratio of police killings to the total homicide rate-the statistics, both official and unofficial, for jamaica, buenos aires, s&amp;atilde;o paulo, and rio de janeiro all point toward the conclusion that the police are summarily executing suspects in routine, non-partisan cases. directed almost exclusively against anonymous, poor people, this abuse of deadly force appears as an extreme form of coercive social control. when the threat of social unrest seems high--because of increased social mobilization together with increased economic misery--the police may summarily execute a large number of suspects, providing that both elite and lower-class opinion tolerates the executions as legitimate. in all these locations, while opinion is split, the police violence is minimally acceptable; indeed, the prevalence of private vigilantism signals its acceptability with the mass of people.nonetheless, because jamaica, argentina, and brazil are liberal states, it is difficult to view police homicides as legitimate except under the rubric of crime control and under the rule of law. accordingiy, virtually all police killings are justified to the public as acts of self-defense, typically in the context of shoot-outs. this justification appears to be essential for organizing public opinion even though, for at least some people at all socioeconomic levels, summary executions, like vigilantism, are considered the proper punishment for alleged crimes. experience in other countries suggests that it is possible for the authorities to limit and even prevent police violence. this effort will not be made in jamaica, argentina, or brazil, however, so long as police use of deadly force constitutes a

1980s, despite the rise of terrorist attacks worldwide, the international community failed to respond cooperatively. when u.s. citizens were the focus of attacks, even friendly countries had little incentive to risk the safety of their citizens or the tenets of their foreign policy to prosecute terrorists. in response, the united states passed statutes providing for extraterritorial jurisdiction over acts committed abroad against u.s. citizens and then engaged in a series of dramatic seizures to enforce these measures. unfortunately, these abductions were generally not defensible under international law and, in any event, could not be used when a terrorist was located within the territory of a major friendly country. in large part unexpectedly, however, the statutes have rendered such extraordinary measures unnecessary while still remedying what was a visible failure of international criminal cooperation.even without threatening international abductions, the united states can use the hostage taking act and the terrorist prosecution act to demand extradition and to undertake independent investigations of violations of federal laws. these efforts put pressure on governments that have custody over terrorists. the international and the diplomatic consequences of neither extraditing nor prosecuting have proven sufficient to encourage u.s. allies to prosecute terrorists themselves. surprisingly, therefore, the statutes have turned out to be effective because they encourage prosecutions of terrorists abroad, thereby remedying a failure in international cooperation and helping to ensure a consistent, strong, international response to acts of terrorism despite the continued inability of the united states to obtain custody of those attacking its citizens.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Richard W  Harding </authors><title>rational-choice gun use in armed robbery: the likely deterrent effect on gun use of mandatory additional imprisonment</title><content>the western australian findings suggest that a sentencing policy targeted specifically at the use of guns in committing robbery could be effective in discouraging the choice of this weapon. the proposed sentence is a mandatory minimum period of twelve months for the first offense. sentencing for the principal, or focal, offense of robbery would be governed by existing law. a second, or even later, gun-using offense should carry a greater mandatory additional sentence. at the same time, given the social and experiential factors that have brought offenders to the point of choosing a weapon and a modus operandi, any such policy must be applied humanely. rational-choice theory does not deny that there may be unequal opportunities to exercise choice; it does, however, assert that decision making can be influenced by an appropriate sentencing strategy.the implementation of any such policy should be carefully evaluated both in aggregate studies, as has been done in canada, and in individualized, rational-choice research. the evaluation should address not only the efficacy of the broad strategy but also the narrower question of

statutes and monetary sanctions imposed thereunder will be seen merely as tiresome regulations carrying nominal penalties, the payment of which is no more than a legitimate cost of doing business? will the fact that such statutes include, as an ultimate sanction, imprisonment alter this perception? will resort to prosecution under the traditional criminal law of fraud on the public provide a substantial disincentive to environmental offending, where corporate officers can anticipate a criminal conviction and the loss of liberty in the event of detection?if the statement of the court of appeal in walters is a guide, then the trend in new zealand is likely to be imprisonment of offenders convicted of environmental crimes. prosecutions under the crimes act will brand transgressors as

rights standards, many of which have been incorporated into national constitutions, in extradition cases. the emphasis on national courts reflects the particular north american experience, where only limited jurisdiction in these matters exists in the relevant international forum, the un human rights committee. accordingly, resort must be made to domestic constitutional rights.in order to give practical effect to international human rights obligations in canada and the united states, courts can play a useful role, in addition to the role exercised by the executive branch of government. the ambit of this role depends upon the point at which judicial interference is viewed as necessary to protect fundamental rights and override considerations of international cooperation. in canada the point has been located where there is a risk of treatment that is simply unacceptable178 or that would shock the conscience. in the united states, courts have in the past demonstrated a degree of willingness to probe into potential violations that would be expected if extradition were to be granted and that would offend a federal court's sense of decency.180 however, there is dispute about the propriety of this encroachment on the rule of noninquiry. recently, the pendulum has begun to swing toward applying the rule of noninquiry more stringently and, at present, u.s. courts play a very limited role in examining the motives behind an extradition request and the procedures or punishment that likely await an individual upon return to the requesting state.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Neil Cameron </authors><title>the police and crime control: effectiveness, community policing, and legal change</title><content>current research on the level of police resources, patrol and investigation strategies, community policing, and the likely impact of changes in the legal framework confirms the simple truth that the police capacity to influence crime has always been vastly overstated. unfortunately, the preventive police forces that emerged in anglo-american jurisdictions in the wake of sir robert peel's new police were linked directly and for the first time to the crime rate. while there was little that they could actually do about the crime rate per se, questions of police effectiveness, resource allocation, and the adequacy of police powers have tended to be answered on the basis of such data ever since. the need now is to find different ways of measuring and evaluating police work. it may be that the major contribution of community policing is to highlight precisely this issue by shifting the focus of policing away from the crime rate and by forcing police departments, politicians, and academics to confront the real capabilities of the police and to devise methods of evaluating them and promoting them to an increasingly skeptical world.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>William W  Wilkins Jr  |  | Phyllis J  Newton  | John R  Steer </authors><title>the sentencing reform act of 1984: a bold approach to the unwarranted sentencing disparity problem</title><content>in 1984, after years of study and thorough debate, a bipartisan majority of the congress enacted perhaps the most far-reaching reform of the federal criminal justice system in the history of the united states. the sentencing reform act and the federal sentencing guidelines are now beginning to produce data indicating that the objectives of avoiding unwarranted disparity and invidious discrimination are being achieved.after an uncertain beginning, the guidelines are gaining acceptance by courts and criminal justice practitioners. as one appellate court observed in admonishing lower courts that the guidelines must be respected:</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Neil Alan Weiner </authors><title>when death is the sanction&amp;#x2014;united states and worldwide perspectives</title><content>gross and mauro are probably correct in concluding that in the united states mccleskey ... certainly seems to represent a final decision to give up any pretense that the death penalty can be tamed.8 current attempts at judicial oversight in the united states have proved as ineffective in bridling the discretion of capital case decision makers as were prior attempts at legislative and gubernatorial oversight. the historical lesson appears to be unmistakable: the nation must either abolish the death penalty or suffer its improper application and imposition. the worldwide pattern documented by hood reinforces this conclusion; when the death penalty is on a country's statute books, it will be used&amp;#x2014;but, sooner or later, improperly so. no attempts at judicial or other forms of vigilance have proved this prediction to be incorrect&amp;#x2014;no matter how few cases have been permitted to flow through the system and no matter how principled have been the system and its officials.</content></document></documents>
