Title: The Oz Programming Model
Abstract: The Oz Programming Model (OPM) is a concurrent programming modelsubsuming higher- order functional and object-oriented programming asfacets of a general model. This is particularly interesting forconcurrent object-oriented programming, for which no comprehensiveformal model existed until now. The model can be extended so that itcan express encapsulated problem solvers generalizing the problemsolving capabilities of constraint logic programming. OPM has beendeveloped together with a concomitant programming language Oz, whichis designed for applications that require complex symboliccomputations, organization into multiple agents, and soft real-timecontrol. An efficient, robust, and interactive implementation of Ozis freely available.

Title: BDI-agents: from theory to practice
Abstract: The study of computational agents capable of rational behaviour hasreceived a great deal of attention in recent years. Theoreticalformalizations of such agents and their implementations haveproceeded in parallel with little or no connection between them. Thispaper explores a particular type of rational agent, aBelief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent. The primary aim of this paper isto integrate (a) the theoretical foundations of BDI agents from botha quantitative decision-theoretic perspective and a symbolicreasoning perspective; (b) the implementations of BDI agents from anideal theoretical perspective and a more practical perspective; and(c) the building of large-scale applications based on BDI agents. Inparticular, an air-traffic management application will be describedfrom both a theoretical and an implementation perspective. 1Introduction The design of systems that are required to performhigh-level management and control tasks in complex dynamicenvironments is becomi...

Title: The Complexity of Concept Languages
Abstract: The basic feature of Terminological Knowledge Representation Systemsis to representknowledge by means of taxonomies, here called terminologies, and toprovidea specialized reasoning engine to do inferences on these structures.The taxonomy is built through a representation language calledconcept language(or description logic), which is given well-defined set-theoreticsemantics. The efficiencyof reasoning has often been advocated as a primary motivation for theuseof such systems.Deduction methods and computational properties of reasoning problemsin conceptlanguages are the subject of this paper. The main contributions ofthe paperare: (1) a complexity analysis of concept satisfiability andsubsumption for a wideclass of concept languages; (2) the algorithms for these inferencesthat comply withthe worst-case complexity of the reasoning task they perform.Contents1 Introduction 31.1 Concepts as Structured Set Descriptions : : : : : : : : : : : : :: : : : : : 31.2 ...

Title: Kasbah: An agent marketplace for buying and selling goods
Abstract: While there are many Web services which help users find things tobuy, we know of none which actually try to automate the process ofbuying and selling. Kasbah is a virtual marketplace on the Web whereusers create autonomous agents to buy and sell goods on their behalf.Users specify parameters to guide and constrain an agent's overallbehavior. A simple prototype has been built to test the viability ofthis concept. Introduction Kasbah is a Web-based system where userscreate autonomous agents that buy and sell goods on their behalf. Ouroriginal idea was to reinvent the classified ads. We observed thatthere are many sites on the Web that post ads. Some of these sitesallow users to perform keyword searches on the ads (Seattle Times/PI1996). Some have their ads nicely categorized, making it easier tofind ones of interest (ADWorld 1996). Other sites have more advancedsearching capabilities. For example, Stanford's Infomaster(Infomaster 1995) (Geddis et al. 1995) allows users to ...

Title: Markov Games as a Framework for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Abstract: In the Markov decision process (MDP) formalizationof reinforcement learning, a single adaptiveagent interacts with an environment defined by aprobabilistic transition function. In this solipsisticview, secondary agents can only be part of theenvironment and are therefore fixed in their behavior.The framework of Markov games allowsus to widen this view to include multiple adaptiveagents with interacting or competing goals.This paper considers a step in this direction inwhich exactly two agents with diametrically opposedgoals share an environment. It describesa Q-learning-like algorithm for finding optimalpolicies and demonstrates its application to a simpletwo-player game in which the optimal policyis probabilistic.1 INTRODUCTIONNo agent lives in a vacuum; it must interact with other agentsto achieve its goals. Reinforcement learning is a promisingtechnique for creating agents that co-exist [Tan, 1993,Yanco and Stein, 1993] , but the mathematical frameworkthat just...

Title: Collaborative Plans for Complex Group Action
Abstract: The original formulation of SharedPlans (Grosz and Sidner, 1990a) wasdeveloped to providea model of collaborative planning in which it was not necessary forone agent to have intentions-totoward an act of a different agent. Unlike other contemporaneousapproaches (Searle, 1990), thisformulation provided for two agents to coordinate their activitieswithout introducing any notionof irreducible joint intentions. However, it only treated activitiesthat directly decomposed intosingle-agent actions, did not address the need for agents to committo their joint activity, and didnot adequately deal with agents having only partial knowledge of theway in which to performan action. This paper provides a revised and expanded version ofSharedPlans that addressesthese shortcomings. It also reformulates Pollack's definition ofindividual plans (Pollack, 1990)to handle cases in which a single agent has only partial knowledge;this reformulation mesheswith the definition of SharedPlans.

Title: Controlling Cooperative Problem Solving in Industrial Multi-Agent Systems Using Joint Intentions
Abstract: One reason why Distributed AI (DAI) technology has been deployed inrelatively few real-size applicationsis that it lacks a clear and implementable model of cooperativeproblem solving which specifieshow agents should operate and interact in complex, dynamic andunpredictable environments. Asa consequence of the experience gained whilst building a number ofDAI systems for industrial applications,a new principled model of cooperation has been developed. This model,called Joint Responsibility,has the notion of joint intentions at its core. It specifiespre-conditions which must be attainedbefore collaboration can commence and prescribes how individualsshould behave both when jointactivity is progressing satisfactorily and also when it runs intodifficulty. The theoretical model hasbeen used to guide the implementation of a general-purposecooperation framework and the qualitativeand quantitative benefits of this implementation have been assessedthrough a series of comparativ...

Title: Commitments and Conventions: The Foundation of Coordination in Multi-Agent Systems
Abstract: Distributed Artificial Intelligence systems, in which multiple agentsinteract to improve theirindividual performance and to enhance the system's overall utility,are becoming an increasinglypervasive means of conceptualising a diverse range of applications.As the discipline matures,researchers are beginning to strive for the underlying theories andprinciples which guide thecentral processes of coordination and cooperation. Here agentcommunities are modelled using adistributed goal search formalism and it is argued that commitments(pledges to undertake aspecified course of action) and conventions (means of monitoringcommitments in changingcircumstances) are the foundation of coordination in multi-agentsystems. An analysis of existingcoordination models which use concepts akin to commitments andconventions is undertakenbefore a new unifying framework is presented. Finally a number ofprominent coordinationtechniques which do not explicitly involve commitments or convent...

Title: Towards Flexible Teamwork
Abstract: Many AI researchers are today striving to build agent teams forcomplex, dynamicmulti-agent domains, with intended applications in arenas such aseducation, training,entertainment, information integration, and collective robotics.Unfortunately, uncertaintiesin these complex, dynamic domains obstruct coherent teamwork. Inparticular, teammembers often encounter differing, incomplete, and possiblyinconsistent views of their environment.Furthermore, team members can unexpectedly fail in fulfillingresponsibilitiesor discover unexpected opportunities. Highly flexible coordinationand communication iskey in addressing such uncertainties. Simply fitting individualagents with precomputedcoordination plans will not do, for their inflexibility can causesevere failures in teamwork,and their domain-specificity hinders reusability.Our central hypothesis is that the key to such flexibility andreusability is providingagents with general models of teamwork. Agents exploit such models...

Title: Cool: A language for describing coordination in multiagent systems
Abstract: Agent interaction takes place at several levels. Current work in theARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort has addressed the informationcontent level by the KIF language and the intentional level by theKQML language. In this paper we address the coordination level bymeans of our Coordination Language (COOL) that relies on speechact based communication, but integrates it in a structuredconversationframework that captures the coordination mechanisms agentsuse when working together. We are currently using this language (i)to represent coordination mechanisms for the supply chain ofmanufacturingenterprises modeled as intelligent agents and (ii) as anenvironment for designing and validating coordination protocolsfor multi-agent systems. This paper describes the basic elements ofthis language: conversation objects, conversation rules, errorrecoveryrules, continuation rules, conversation nesting.

Title: Communicative Actions for Artificial Agents
Abstract: This paper considers the semantics of the agent communicationlanguage KQML. By using this languagefor communication, agents will be able to requestand provide services. Indeed, numerous projects haveshown how the language can profitably support interoperationamong distributed agents. However, beforebecoming a widely-accepted standard, it would beworthwhile to examine the language in detail, especiallythe semantical issues it raises. This paper identifiesnumerous difficulties with the language, and anattempt is made to point to their resolution. The paperillustrates the kind of semantics we believe to be necessaryto characterize agent communication languages,identifies an important adequacy condition (compositionality)and shows how to compose a question froma request and an inform. Finally, the paper discussespossible impacts to be felt on various KQML decisionsfrom the semantical issues raised here.Keywords: Agent Communication Languages,KQML, speech actsIntroduct...

Title: Software Agents: An Overview
Abstract: Agent software is a rapidly developing area of research. However, theoveruse of the word `agent' has tended to mask the fact that, inreality, there is a truly heterogeneous body of research beingcarried out under this banner. This overview paper presents atypology of agents. Next, it places agents in context, defines themand then goes on, inter alia, to overview critically the rationales,hypotheses, goals, challenges and state-of-the-art demonstrators ofthe various agent types in our typology. Hence, it attempts to makeexplicit much of what is usually implicit in the agents literature.It also proceeds to overview some other general issues which pertainto all the types of agents in the typology. This paper largelyreviews software agents, and it also contains some strong opinionsthat are not necessarily widely accepted by the agent community. 2 1Introduction The main goal of this paper is to overview the rapidlyevolving area of software agents.

Abstract: Many researchers have shown that there is no single best organizationor coordination mechanism for all environments. This paper discussesthe design and implementation of an extendable family of coordinationmechanisms, called Generalized Partial Global Planning (GPGP). Theset of coordination mechanisms described here assists in schedulingactivities for teams of cooperative computational agents. The GPGPapproach has several unique features. First, it is not tied to asingle domain. Each mechanism is defined as a response to certainfeatures in the current task environment. We show that differentcombinations of mechanisms are appropriate for different taskenvironments. Secondly, the approach works in conjunction with anagent's existing local planner/scheduler. Finally, the initial set offive mechanisms presented here generalizes and extends the PartialGlobal Planning (PGP) algorithm. In comparison to PGP, GPGP schedulestasks with deadlines, it allows agent heterogeneity, it ex...

Title: Learning to Coordinate without Sharing Information
Abstract: Researchers in the field of Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI)have been developing efficient mechanisms to coordinate theactivities of multiple autonomous agents. The need for coordinationarises because agents have to share resources and expertise requiredto achieve their goals. Previous work in the area includes usingsophisticated information exchange protocols, investigatingheuristics for negotiation, and developing formal models ofpossibilities of conflict and cooperation among agent interests. Inorder to handle the changing requirements of continuous and dynamicenvironments, we propose learning as a means to provide additionalpossibilities for effective coordination. We use reinforcementlearning techniques on a block pushing problem to show that agentscan learn complimentary policies to follow a desired path without anyknowledge about each other. We theoretically analyze andexperimentally verify the effects of learning rate on systemconvergence, and demonstrat...

Title: Middle-Agents for the Internet
Abstract: Like middle-men in physical commerce, middleagentssupport the flow of information in electroniccommerce, assisting in locating and connecting theultimate information provider with the ultimate informationrequester. Many different types of middleagentswill be useful in realistic, large, distributed,open multi-agent problem solving systems. Theseinclude matchmakers or yellow page agents that processadvertisements, blackboard agents that collect requests,and brokers that process both. The behaviorsof each type of middle-agent have certain performancecharacteristics---privacy, robustness, andadaptiveness qualities---that are related to characteristicsof the external environment and of the agentsthemselves. For example, while brokered systems aremore vulnerable to certain failures, they are also ableto cope more quickly with a rapidly fluctuating agentworkforce and meet certain privacy considerations.This paper identifies a spectrum of middle-agents,characterizes the beha...

Title: Communication in Reactive Multiagent Robotic Systems
Abstract: Multiple cooperating robots are able to complete many tasks morequickly and reliably than one robot alone. Communication between therobots can multiply their capabilities and effectiveness, but to whatextent? In this research, the importance of communication in roboticsocieties is investigated through experiments on both simulated andreal robots. Performance was measured for three different types ofcommunication for three different tasks. The levels of communicationare progressively more complex and potentially more expensive toimplement. For some tasks, communication can significantly improveperformance, but for others inter-agent communication is apparentlyunnecessary. In cases where communication helps, the lowest level ofcommunication is almost as effective as the more complex type. Thebulk of these results are derived from thousands of simulations runwith randomly generated initial conditions. The simulation resultshelp determine appropriate parameters for the reac...

Title: Multiagent Systems: A Survey from a Machine Learning Perspective
Abstract: Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) has existed as a subfieldof AI for less than two decades. DAI is concerned with systems thatconsist of multiple independent entities that interact in a domain.Traditionally, DAI has been divided into two sub-disciplines:Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) focusses on the informationmanagement aspects of systems with several branches working togethertowards a common goal; Multiagent Systems (MAS) deals with behaviormanagement in collections of several independent entities, or agents.This survey of MAS is intended to serve as an introduction to thefield and as an organizational framework. A series of increasinglycomplex general multiagent scenarios are presented. For eachscenario, the issues that arise are described along with a samplingof the techniques that exist to deal with them. The presentedtechniques are not exhaustive, but they highlight how multiagentsystems can be and have been used to build complex systems. Whenoptions exi...

Title: Cooperative Information Gathering: A Distributed Problem Solving Approach
Abstract: We contrast two approaches to the problem of information gatheringthat may be characterized as distributed processing and distributedproblem solving. The former is characteristic of most existinginformation gathering systems, while the latter is central toresearch in multi-agent systems. We examine features of complexinformation carrying environments and the information gathering taskthat demonstrate both the utility of viewing information gathering asdistributed problem solving and difficulties with viewing it asdistributed processing. We propose a new approach to informationgathering based on the distributed problem solving paradigm and itsattendant body of research in multi-agent systems and distributedartificial intelligence. This approach, called CooperativeInformation Gathering, involves concurrent, asynchronous discoveryand composition of information spread across a network of informationservers.

Title: The Open Agent Architecture: a framework for building distributed software systems
Abstract: The Open Agent Architecture (OAA), developed and used for severalyears at SRI International, makes it possible for software servicesto be provided through the cooperative efforts of distributedcollections of autonomous agents. Communication and cooperationbetween agents are brokered by one or more facilitators, which areresponsible for matching requests, from users and agents, withdescriptions of the capabilities of other agents. Thus, it is notgenerally required that a user or agent know the identities,locations, or number of other agents involved in satisfying arequest. OAA is structured so as to minimize the effort involved increating new agents and "wrapping" legacy applications,written in various languages and operating on various platforms; toencourage the reuse of existing agents; and to allow for dynamism andflexibility in the makeup of agent communities. Distinguishingfeatures of OAA as compared with related work include extremeflexibility in using facilitator-b...

For the past few years, I have beenexploring this approach not only as a methodology for solvingparticular distributed control problems, but also as a genericprogramming paradigm for the development of distributed systems basedon these methods. By a programming paradigm, I mean that the exerciseof defining a computational market leads to the specification of aprocedural solution to the underlying allocation problem facing thatmarket.

To this end, thispaper models agent communitiesusing a distributed goal search formalism, and argues thatcommitments (pledges to undertake aspecific course of action) and conventions (means of monitoringcommitments in changingcircumstances) are the foundation of coordination in all DAI systems.1.

The attention to semantic query optimization,however,has been restricted due to its inherent complexity. We take a secondlookat semantic query optimization in object-oriented databases and findthatreasoning techniques for concept languages developed in ArtificialIntelligenceapply to this problem because concept languages have been tailoredfor efficiencyand their semantics is compatible with class and query definitions inobject-oriented databases.

Title: The Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problem: Formalization and Algorithms
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a formalism called a distributed constraintsatisfaction problem (distributed CSP) andalgorithms for solving distributed CSPs. A distributed CSP is aconstraint satisfaction problem in which variables and constraintsaredistributed among multiple agents. Various application problems inDistributed Artificial Intelligence can be formalized as distributedCSPs. We present our newly developed technique called asynchronousbacktracking that allows agents to act asynchronously andconcurrently without any global control, while guaranteeing thecompleteness of the algorithm. Furthermore, we describe how theasynchronous backtracking algorithm can be modified into a moreefficient algorithm called an asynchronous weak-commitmentsearch, which can revise a bad decision without exhaustive search bychanging the priority order of agents dynamically. Theexperimental results on various example problems show that theasynchronous weak-commitment search algorithm ...

Title: Learning to behave socially
Abstract: Our previous work introduced a methodology for synthesizing andanalyzing basic behaviors which served as a substrate for generatinga large repertoire of higher-level group interactions (Mataric 1992,Mataric 1993). In this paper we describe how, given the substrate,agents can learn to behave socially, i.e. to maximize averageindividual benefit by maximizing collective benefit. While this is awell-defined problem for rational agents, it is difficult to learn insituated domains. We describe three sources of reinforcement and showtheir necessity for learning non-greedy social rules. The learningstrategy is demonstrated on a group of physical mobile robotslearning to yield and share information in a foraging task.

Our work extends previous workby Littman on zero-sum stochastic games to a broader framework.

When there existmultiple Nash equilibria in the game, this algorithm should becombined with other learning techniques to find optimal strategies. 1Introduction Reinforcement learning has gained attention andextensive study in recent years [5, 12].

Title: Advantages of a Leveled Commitment Contracting Protocol
Abstract: In automated negotiation systems consisting of self-interestedagents, contracts have traditionally been binding. Such contracts donot allow agents to efficiently accommodate future events. Gametheory has proposed contingency contracts to solve this problem.Among computational agents, contingency contracts are oftenimpractical due to large numbers of interdependent and unanticipatedfuture events to be conditioned on, and because some events are notmutually observable. This paper proposes a leveled commitmentcontracting protocol that allows self-interested agents toefficiently accommodate future events by having the possibility ofunilaterally decommitting from a contract based on local reasoning. Adecommitment penalty is assigned to both agents in a contract: to befreed from the obligations of the contract, an agent only pays thispenalty to the other party. It is shown through formal analysis ofmultiple contracting settings that this leveled commitment feature ina contract...

Title: Foundations of a Logical Approach to Agent Programming
Abstract: This paper describes a novel approach to high-level agent programmingbased on a highly developed logical theory of action. The userprovides a specification of the agents' basic actions (preconditionsand effects) as well as of relevant aspects of the environment, in anextended version of the situation calculus. He can then specifybehaviors for the agents in terms of these actions in a programminglanguage where one can refer to conditions in effect in theenvironment. When an implementation of the basic actions is provided,the programs can be executed in a real environment; otherwise, asimulated execution is still possible. The interpreter automaticallymaintains the world model required to execute programs based on thespecification. The theoretical framework includes a solution to theframe problem, allows agents to have incomplete knowledge of theirenvironment, and handles perceptual actions. The theory can also beused to prove programs correct. A simple meeting scheduling a...

Title: A Social Reasoning Mechanism Based On Dependence Networks
Abstract: . This paper describes the fundamental conceptsof a social reasoning mechanism, designed to be part of anagent's internal model, in a multi-agent systems (MAS) context.It enables an agent to reason about the others using informationabout their goals, actions, resources and plans. Everyagent stores this information in a data structure called externaldescription. We have formally defined and implementedthe concepts of external description, dependence relation, anddependence network. One of the main contributions of thiswork is that an agent can infer his dependence on others usingeither his own plans or those of the others. As a result,we have defined a preliminary taxonomy of dependence situations regarding the goal being analysed (unilateral, mutual orreciprocal) and the sets of plans used in this reasoning mechanism(mutually or locally believed). We have used this modelto build a dependence network simulator, called DEPNET,which is also briefly described in this paper...

Title: Terminological Logics with Modal Operators
Abstract: Terminological knowledge representation formalisms can be used torepresent objective, time-independent facts about an applicationdomain. Notions like belief, intentions, time -- which are essentialfor the representation of multi-agent environments -- can only beexpressed in a very limited way. For such notions, modal logics withpossible worlds semantics provides a formally well-founded andwell-investigated basis. This paper presents a framework forintegrating modal operators into terminological knowledgerepresentation languages. These operators can be used both inside ofconcept expressions and in front of terminological and assertionalaxioms. The main restrictions are that all modal operators areinterpreted in the basic logic K, and that we consider increasingdomains instead of constant domains. We introduce syntax andsemantics of the extended language, and show that satisfiability offinite sets of formulas is decidable.

Abstract: With the recent rapid growth of interest in MultiAgent Systems, bothin artificial intelligence and software engineering, has come anassociated difficulty concerning basic terms and concepts. Inparticular, the terms agency and autonomy are used with increasingfrequency to denote different notions with different connotations. Inthis paper we lay the foundations for a principled theory of agencyand autonomy, and specify the relationship between them.

Given thisframework, we show illuminating results on the interplay betweenbasic adaptive behavior parameters and their effect on systemefficiency.

By colluding (coordinating their actions by solvinga joint optimization problem), the agents can sometimes save costscompared to operating individually. A model of bounded rationality isadopted, where computation resources are costly. It is not worthsolvingthe problems optimally: solution quality is decision-theoreticallytraded off against computation cost. A normative,protocol-independenttheory of coalitions among bounded rational (BR) agents is devised.The optimal coalition structure and its stability are significantlyaffectedby the agents' algorithms' performance profiles (PPs) and theunit cost of computation.

Title: Coalitions Among Computationally Bounded Agents
Abstract: This paper analyzes coalitions among self-interested agents that needto solve combinatorial optimization problems to operate efficientlyin the world. By colluding (coordinating their actions by solving ajoint optimization problem) the agents can sometimes save costscompared to operating individually. A model of bounded rationality isadopted where computation resources are costly. It is not worthwhilesolving the problems optimally: solution quality isdecision-theoretically traded off against computation cost. Anormative, application- and protocol-independent theory of coalitionsamong boundedrational agents is devised. The optimal coalitionstructure and its stability are significantly affected by the agents'algorithms' performance profiles and the cost of computation. Thisrelationship is first analyzed theoretically. Then a domainclassification including rational and bounded-rational agents isintroduced. Experimental results are presented in vehicle routingwith real data f...

Title: Facilitating Open Communication in Agent Systems: The InfoSleuth Infrastructure
Abstract: . This paper addresses issues in developing multiagent systems ---those in which it is easyto expand the functionality by adding new agents with newcapabilities, and those which facilitateinteroperability with other agent systems. In this paper, we arguethat an open multiagent systemshould define the following support elements for agent communication:1. A common set of speech acts to define the types of messages thatan agent might send to anotheragent.2. A common service ontology by which the agents can describe theircapabilities to each other, andreason about which agents have the capabilities needed to executespecific tasks.3. A common set of prescriptive conversation policies to define theacceptable exchanges of messagesbetween agents.In addition to the above, we also discuss the utility of having amatchmaking agent that can reason overagent capabilities --- described using the service ontology --- torecommend agents for specific tasks,whose requirements are als...

Title: A market protocol for decentralized task allocation
Abstract: We present a decentralized market protocol for allocatingtasks among agents that contend for scarce resources.Agents trade tasks and resources at prices determined by anauction protocol. We specify a simple set of bidding policiesthat, along with the auction mechanism, exhibits desirableconvergence properties. The system always reachesquiescence. If the system reaches quiescence below the consumer's reserve price for the high level task, it will be in asolution state. If the system finds a solution it will reachquiescencein a solution state. Experimental evidence supportsour conjecture that the system will converge to a solutionwhen one exists and the consumer bids sufficiently high. Wedescribe the system's application to and implementation inan agent-based digital library.1.

Title: A market protocol for decentralized task allocation
Abstract: I present a decentralized market protocol for allocating andschedulingtasks among agents to form supply chains. The protocol resolvesconstraints arising from hierarchical subtask relationships andresource scarcity. Agents negotiate through auctions according tospecified bidding policies, and the auctions in turn determine theallocationsand prices of the tasks and resources. I describe some equilibrium,convergence, and optimality properties of the system. I proposeto further analyze the convergence properties, analyze adaptivity andagent strategic behavior, and develop a model of task allocation foraconcrete problem domain.1 OverviewIn a multiagent system (MAS), we must often address the problem ofallocatingresources and effort in such a way that the resulting collection ofagents can accomplish some complex tasks.

Title: Interaction and Intelligent Behavior
Abstract: This thesis addresses situated, embodied agents interacting incomplex domains. Itfocuses on two problems: 1) synthesis and analysis of intelligentgroup behavior, and2) learning in complex group environments.Basic behaviors, control laws that cluster constraints to achieveparticular goalsand have the appropriate compositional properties, are proposed aseffective primitivesfor control and learning. The thesis describes the process ofselecting such basicbehaviors, formally specifying them, algorithmically implementingthem, and empiricallyevaluating them. All of the proposed ideas are validated with a groupof up to20 mobile robots using a basic behavior set consisting of:safe--wandering, following,aggregation, dispersion, and homing. The set of basic behaviors actsas a substrate forachieving more complex high--level goals and tasks.

Title: Equilibrium Analysis of the Possibilities of Unenforced Exchange in Multiagent Systems
Abstract: In multiagent systems, interaction protocols areusually enforced by law. Enforcement is problematicamong computational agents, becausethey may operate under incomplete or differentlaws, the laws may not be uniformly enforced,and the agents can vanish easily. This paperpresents an enforcement free method for carryingout exchanges so that both agents aremotivated to abide to their contract. This isachieved by splitting the exchanged goods intopartial exchanges so that at each step, bothagents benefit more from the future of the exchangethan from vanishing with the goods orpayment. The conditions for such exchangeare presented in general, and the maximumdeliveries and payments---for any point in theexchange---are solved for. Similar analysis iscarried out for the case, where the agents'current actions affect their future contracts.Strategic delaying is also discussed. The paperpresents a fast algorithm that will find asequence of independent parti...

Title: The Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problem: Formalization and Algorithms
Abstract: A distributed constraint satisfaction problem can formalizevarious application problems in MAS, and several algorithmsfor solving this problem have been developed. Onelimitation of these algorithms is that they assume each agenthas only one local variable. Although simple modificationsenable these algorithms to handle multiple local variables,obtained algorithms are neither efficient nor scalableto larger problems.We develop a new algorithm that can handle multiple localvariables efficiently, which is based on the asynchronousweak-commitment search algorithm. In this algorithm, abad local solution can be modified without forcing otheragents to exhaustively search local problems. Also, the numberof interactions among agents can be decreased sinceagents communicate only when they find local solutions thatsatisfy all of the local constraints. Experimental evaluationsshow that this algorithm is far more efficient than an algorithmthat uses the prioritization among agents.1

Title: Diagnosis as an Integral Part of Multi-Agent Adaptability TITLE2:
Abstract: Agents working under real world conditions may face an environmentcapable of changing rapidly from one moment to the next, eitherthrough perceived faults, unexpected interactions or adversarialintrusions. To gracefully and efficiently handle such situations, themembers of a multi-agent system must be able to adapt, either byevolving internal structures and behavior or repairing or isolatingthose external influenced believed to be malfunctioning. The firststep in achieving adaptability is diagnosis - being able toaccurately detect and determine the cause of a fault based on itssymptoms. In this paper we examine how domain independent diagnosisplays a role in multi-agent systems, including the informationrequired to support and produce diagnoses. Particular attention ispaid to coordination based diagnosis directed by a causal model.Several examples are described in the context of an Intelligent Homeenvironment, and the issue of diagnostic sensitivity versusefficiency is ad...

Title: Flexible Social Laws
Abstract: Although communication is generally considered to dominate overprocessing cost in distributed systems, the problem of communicationcost in multiagent planning has not been sufficiently addressed. Onemethod for reducing both communication cost and planning time is theuse of social laws. Social laws, however, can be too restrictive,limiting soundness. Flexible social laws can enable multiagentsystems to reap the benefits of reduced communication cost andplanning time (except in the worst case), without limiting soundness(although optimality may be degraded). By analyzing the performance,we show that this model can make multiagent planning exponentiallymore efficient without limiting its applicability. 1 Introduction Asautomation of intelligent tasks increases, the need will arise forheterogeneous agents working in a common environment. As a result,agents will need to plan and coordinate plans in real time. [ Cook,1994 ] has described three methods of handling multiple age...

Title: Towards a formal theory of communication for multi-agent systems
Abstract: Agents in multiagent systems interact to a large extent bycommunicating. Such communication may be fruitfully studied from thepoint of view of speech act theory. In order for multiagent systemsto be formally and rigorously designed and analyzed, a semantics ofspeech acts that gives their objective model-theoretic conditions ofsatisfaction is needed. However, most research into multiagentsystems that deals with communication provides only informaldescriptions of the different message types used. And this problem isnot addressed at all by traditional speech act theory or by AIresearch into discourse understanding. I provide a formal semanticsfor the major kinds of speech acts at a level that has not beenconsidered before. The resulting theory applies uniformly to a widerange of multiagent systems. Some applications of this theory areoutlined, and some of its theorems listed. 1 Introduction Multiagentsystems are ubiquitous in Artificial Intelligence. Even in thesimplest s...

Because of theinherent complexity of MAS, there is much interest in using MachineLearning (ML) techniques to help build multiagent systems. Roboticsoccer is a particularly good domain for studying MAS and MultiagentLearning. Our approach to using ML as a tool for building SoccerServer clients involves layering increasingly complex learnedbehaviors. In this article, we describe two levels of learnedbehaviors. First, the clients learn a low-level individual skill thatallows them to control the ball effectively. Then, using this learnedskill, they learn a higher-level skill that involves multipleplayers. For both skills, we describe the learning method in detailand report on our extensive empirical testing. We also verifyempirically that the learned skills are applicable to gamesituations.

To illustrate the working of this framework, an importantnew class of agent isidentified and then specified. Socially responsible agents retaintheir local autonomy butstill draw from, and provide resources to, the larger community.Through empirical evaluation,it is shown that such agents produce both good system-wideperformance andgood individual performance.1.

In this paper, we make use of two notionsintroduced in ourrecent book to facilitate designing and reasoning about systems interms of knowledge.The first notion is that of a knowledge-based program. Aknowledge-based program is asyntactic object: a program with tests for knowledge. The secondnotion is that of acontext, which captures the setting in which a program is to beexecuted. In a given context,a standard program (one without tests for knowledge) is representedby (i.e., correspondsin a precise sense to) a unique system. A knowledge-based program, onthe other hand,may be represented by no system, one system, or many systems.

The system has much more internal structure, andhence many internal interfaces. The measure of success is much lessclear. The designer usually finds himself floundering in a sea ofpossibilities, unclear about how one choice will limit his freedom tomake other choices, or affect the size and performance of the entiresystem.

It achieves bothlow latency and high bandwidth, isolates applicationsfrom each other's mistakes, and supplies a rich set ofmessage-delivery semantics. It does so by exploitingseveral techniques:.

However, CLP(D) languages, as well asmost other constraint systems, only allow the programmer to specifyconstraints that must hold. In many applications, such as interactivegraphics, page layout, and decision support, one needs to expresspreferences as well as strict requirements. If we wish to make fulluse of the constraint paradigm, we need ways to represent thesedefaults and preferences declaratively, as constraints, rather thanencoding them in the procedural parts of the language. We describe ascheme for extending CLP(D) to include both required and preferentialconstraints, with an arbitrary number of strengths of preference. Wepresent some of the theory of such languages, and an algorithm forexecuting them. To test our ideas, we have implemented an interpreterfor an instance of this language scheme with D equal to the reals. Wedescribe our interpreter, and outline some examples of using thislanguage.

Title: Measured capacity of an Ethernet: myths and reality
Abstract: Ethernet, a 10 Mbit/sec CSMA/CD network, is one of the mostsuccessfulLAN technologies. Considerable confusion exists as to the actualcapacity ofan Ethernet, especially since some theoretical studies have examinedoperatingregimes that are not characteristic of actual networks. Based onmeasurements of an actual implementation, we show that for a wideclass ofapplications, Ethernet is capable of carrying its nominal bandwidthof usefultraffic, and allocates the bandwidth fairly. We discuss howimplementationscan achieve this performance, describe some problems that have ariseninexisting implementations, and suggest ways to avoid future problems.This paper was originally published in Proceedings of the SIGCOMM '88Symposium onCommunications Architectures and Protocols, ACM SIGCOMM, Stanford,California, August1988.Copyright  1988 Association for Computing MachineryPermission to copy without fee all or part of this material isgranted provided that the copiesare not made ...

Title: Three-Dimensional Widgets
Abstract: The 3D components of today's user interfaces are stillunderdeveloped.Direct interaction with 3D objects has been limited thus farto gestural picking, manipulation with linear transformations, andsimple camera motion. Further, there are no toolkits for building3D user interfaces. We present a system which allows experimentationwith 3D widgets, encapsulated 3D geometry and behavior. Ourwidgets are first-class objects in the same 3D environment used todevelop the application. This integration of widgets and applicationobjects provides a higher bandwidth between interface and applicationthan exists in more traditional UI toolkit-based interfaces. Wehope to allow user-interface designers to build highly interactive3D environments more easily than is possible with today's tools.KeywordsUser Interface Design, Widgets, 3D Interaction, Virtual Reality1 IntroductionModern user-interface software is built using widgets, objects withgeometry and behavior used to control the ap...

Abstract: IntroductionOur paper presents a model for supporting group interaction inlarge-scale virtual worlds 1. Themodel provides generic techniques for managing interactions betweenvarious objects in suchenvironments including humans and computer artefacts. Furthermore,the model is intended tobe sufficiently flexible to apply to any system where a spatialmetric can be identified (i.e. away of measuring distance and orientation). Such applications mightrange from the obviousexample of multi-user virtual reality through conferencing systems,collaborative hypermediaand even databases and information spaces.1The theory described in this paper is being developed as part of theCOMIC project, an ongoing EuropeanESPRIT Basic Research Action which aims to develop theories andtechniques to support the development offuture large scale CSCW systems.

Title: Pad: An Alternative Approach to the Computer Interface
Abstract: We believe that navigation in information spaces is bestsupported by tapping into our natural spatial and geographicways of thinking. To this end, we are developinga new computer interface model called Pad.The ongoing Pad project uses a spatial metaphorfor computer interface design. It provides an intuitivebase for the support of such applications as electronicmarketplaces, information services, and on-line collaboration.Pad is an infinite two dimensional informationplane that is shared among users, much as a network filesystem is shared. Objects are organized geographically;every object occupies a well defined region on the Padsurface.For navigation, Pad uses "portals" - magnifying glassesthat can peer into and roam over different parts of thissingle infinite shared desktop; links to specific itemsare established and broken continually as the portal'sview changes. Portals can recursively look onto otherportals. This paradigm enables the sort of peripheralactivity ge...

Title: Autonomous Interface Agents
Abstract: Two branches of the trend towards "agents" that are gainingcurrency are interface agents, software that actively assists auser in operating an interactive interface, and autonomousagents, software that takes action without user interventionand operates concurrently, either while the user is idle ortaking other actions. These two branches are related, but notidentical, and are often lumped together under the singleterm "agent". Much agent work can be classified as eitherbeing an interface agent, but not autonomous, or as anautonomous agent, but not operating directly in theinterface. We show why it is important to have agents thatare both interface agents and autonomous agents. Weexplore some design principles for such agents, andillustrate these principles with a description of Letizia, anautonomous interface agent that makes real-timesuggestions for Web pages that a user might be interestedin browsing.KeywordsAgents, interface agents, autonomous agents, Web,browsi...

Title: Beyond Interface Builders: Model-Based Interface Tools
Abstract: Interface builders only support the construction of the menus anddialogue boxes of an application. They do not support theconstruction of interfaces of many application classes(visualization, simulation, command and control, domain-specificeditors) because of the dynamic and complex information that theseapplications process. HUMANOID is a model-based interface design andconstruction tool where interfaces are specified by building adeclarative description (model) of their presentation and behavior.HUMANOID' s modeling language provides simple abstraction, iterationand conditional constructs to model the interface features of theseapplication classes. HUMANOID provides an easy-touse designer'sinterface that lets designers build complex interfaces withoutprogramming.

Title: Evolving the Vnode interface
Abstract: The vnode interface has succeeded in supporting a wide range of filesystem implementations over its 6-year history. During that time ithas also had to accommodate evolution in file system semantics, andin the relationship between the file system and the virtual memorysystem. The effects of this evolution have been less than elegant,and pressures for further evolution are mounting. The evolution ofthe interface is reviewed in order to identify the problems it hascaused, and a more robust revision of the interface design proposed.This design also permits new file systems to be implemented in termsof pre-existing file system implementations; it is more like theStreams interface in this respect.

Abstract: Synthesis of systems containing application-specific as well asreprogrammable components, such as off-the-shelf microprocessors,provides a promising approach to realization of complex systems usinga minimal amount of application-specific hardware while still meetingthe required performance constraints. We describe an approach tosynthesis of such hardware-software systems starting from abehavioral description as input. The input system model ispartitioned into hardware and software components based on imposedperformance constraints.

Title: Survey on User Interface Programming
Abstract: This paper reports on the results of a survey of user interfaceprogramming. The survey was widely distributed, andwe received 74 responses. The results show that in today'sapplications, an average of 48% of the code is devoted tothe user interface portion. The average time spent on theuser interface portion is 45% during the design phase, 50%during the implementation phase, and 37% during themaintenance phase. 34% of the systems were implementedusing a toolkit, 27% used a UIMS, 14% used an interfacebuilder, and 26% used no tools. The projects using onlytoolkits spent the largest percentage of the time and codeon the user interface (around 60%) compared to around45% for those with no tools. This appears to be becausethe toolkit systems had more sophisticated user interfaces.The projects using UIMSs or interface builders spent theleast percent of time and code on the user interface (around41%) suggesting that these tools are effective. In general,people were happy with the tools they used, especially thegraphical interface builders. The most common problemspeople reported when developing a user interface includedgetting users' requirements, writing help text, achievingconsistency, learning how to use the tools, getting acceptableperformance, and communicating among various partsof the program.

Title: Adaptive Web Sites: an AI Challenge
Abstract: The creation of a complex web site is a thorny problem in userinterface design. First, different visitors have distinct goals.Second, even a single visitor may have different needs at differenttimes. Much of the information at the site may also be dynamic ortime-dependent. Third, as the site grows and evolves, its originaldesign may no longer be appropriate. Finally, a site may be designedfor a particular purpose but used in unexpected ways. Web serversrecord data about user interactions and accumulate this data overtime. We believe that AI techniques can be used to examine useraccess logs in order to automatically improve the site. We challengethe AI community to create adaptive web sites: sites thatautomatically improve their organization and presentation based onuser access data. Several unrelated research projects in planrecognition, machine learning, knowledge representation, and usermodeling have begun to explore aspects of this problem. We hope thatposing this cha...

Title: The Amulet Environment: New Models for Effective User Interface Software Development
Abstract: The Amulet user interface development environment makes it easier forprogrammers tocreate highly-interactive, graphical user interface software forUnix, Windows orMacintosh. Amulet uses new models for objects, constraints,animation, input, output,commands, and undo. The object system is a prototype-instance modelin which there isno distinction between classes and instances or between methods anddata. The constraintsystem allows any value of any object to be computed by arbitrarycode and supportsmultiple constraint solvers. Animations can be attached to existingobjects with a singleline of code. Input from the user is handled by"Interactor" objects which support reuse ofbehavior objects. The output model provides a declarative definitionof the graphics, andsupports automatic refresh. Command objects encapsulate all of theinformation neededabout operations, including support for various ways to undo them. Ankey feature of theAmulet design is that all graphical objec...

Dynamic queries on thechemical table of elements,computer directories, and a real estate database were built andtested in three separate exploratoryexperiments.

Title: A High-Level and Flexible Framework for Implementing Multiuser User Interfaces
Abstract: We have developed a high-level and flexible framework for supportingthe construction of multi-user user-interfaces. The framework isbased on a generalized editing interaction model, which allows usersto view programs as active data that can be concurrently edited bymultiple users. It consists of several novel components including arefinement of both the Seeheim UIMS architecture and the distributedgraphics architecture that explicitly addresses multi-userinteraction; the abstractions of shared active variables andinteraction variables, which allow users and applications to exchangeinformation; a set of default collaboration rules designed to keepthe collaboration-awareness low in multi- user programs; and a smallbut powerful set of primitives for overriding these rules. Theframework allows users to be dynamically added and removed from amulti-user session, different users to use different user interfacesto interact with an application, the modules interacting with aparticular user to execute on the local workstation, and program-mers to incrementally trade automation for flexibility. We haveimplemented the framework as part of a system called Suite. Thispaper motivates, describes, and illustrates the framework using theconcrete example of Suite, discusses how it can be implemented inother kinds of systems, compares it with related work, discusses itsshortcom- ings, and suggests directions for future work.

Abstract: The creation of a complex web site is a thorny problem in userinterface design. In IJCAI '97, we challenged the AI community toaddress this problem by creating adaptive web sites: sites thatautomatically improve their organization and presentation by miningvisitor access data collected in Web server logs. In this paper weintroduce our own approach to this broad challenge. Specifically, weinvestigate the problem of index page synthesis --- the automaticcreation of pages that facilitate a visitor's navigation of a Website. First, we formalize this problem as a clustering problem andintroduce a novel approach to clustering, which we call clustermining: Instead of attempting to partition the entire data space intodisjoint clusters, we search for a small number of cohesive (andpossibly overlapping) clusters. Next, we present PageGather, acluster mining algorithm that takes Web server logs as input andoutputs the contents of candidate index pages. Finally, we showexperimental...

Abstract: Current interactive user interface construction tools are often moreof a hindrance thana benefit during the early stages of interface design. These toolsare hard to use andthey encourage designers and evaluators to focus on the wrong issues,such as color,fonts, and alignment, at this early stage.

Title: Open Implementation Design Guidelines
Abstract: Designing reusable software modules can be extremely difficult. Thedesign must be balanced between being general enough to address theneeds of a wide range of clients and being focused enough to trulysatisfy the requirements of each specific client. One area where itcan be particularly difficult to strike this balance is in theimplementation strategy of the module. The problem is thatgeneralpurpose implementation strategies, tuned for a wide range ofclients, aren't necessarily optimal for each specific client ---thisis especially an issue for modules that are intended to be reusableand yet provide high-performance. An examination of existing softwaresystems shows that an increasingly important technique for handlingthis problem is to design the module's interface in such a way thatthe client can assist or participate in the selection of the module's implementation strategy. We call this approach openimplementation. When designing the interface to a module that allowsit...

Techniques for segmenting recordings and aprototype user interface for skimming speech are described. Thesystem developed incorporates time-compressed speech and pauseremoval to reduce the time needed to listen to speech recordings.This paper presents a multi-level approach to auditory skimming,along with user interface techniques for interacting with the audioand providing feedback. Several time compression algorithms and anadaptive speech detection technique are also summarized.

Abstract: . Floor control allows users of networked multimediaapplications to utilize and share resources suchas remote devices, distributed data sets, telepointers, orcontinuous media such as video and audio without accessconflicts. Floors are temporary permissions granted dynamicallyto collaborating users in order to mitigate raceconditions and guarantee mutually exclusive resource usage.A general framework for floor control is presented.Collaborative environments are characterized and the requirementsfor realization of floor control will be identified.The differences to session control, as well as concurrencycontrol and access control are elicited. Based upona brief taxonomy of collaboration-relevant parameters,system design issues for floor control are discussed. Floorcontrol mechanisms are discerned from service policiesand principal architectures of collaborative systems arecompared.

Title: Interactive graphic design using automatic presentation knowledge
Abstract: We present three novel tools for creating data graphics: (1)SageBrush, for assembling graphics from primitive objects like bars,lines and axes, (2) SageBook, for browsing previously createdgraphics relevant to current needs, and (3) SAGE, a knowledge-basedpresentation system that automatically designs graphics and alsointerprets a user's specifications conveyed with the other tools. Thecombination of these tools supports two complementary processes in asingle environment: design as a constructive process of selecting andarranging graphical elements, and design as a process of browsing andcustomizing previous cases. SAGE enhances userdirected design bycompleting partial specifications, by retrieving previously createdgraphics based on their appearance and data content, by creating thenovel displays that users specify, and by designing alternatives whenusers request them.

Title: Data Mountain: Using Spatial Memory for Document Management
Abstract: Effective management of documents on computers hasbeen a central user interface problem for many years.One common approach involves using 2D spatial layoutsof icons representing the documents, particularly for informationworkspace tasks. This approach takes advantageof human 2D spatial cognition. More recently, several3D spatial layouts have engaged 3D spatial cognitioncapabilities. Some have attempted to use spatial memoryin 3D virtual environments. However, there has been noproof to date that spatial memory works the same way in3D virtual environments as it does in the real world. Wedescribe a new technique for document managementcalled the Data Mountain, which allows users to placedocuments at arbitrary positions on an inclined plane in a3D desktop virtual environment using a simple 2D interactiontechnique.

Title: Extending Hierarchical Constraint Logic Programming: Nonmonotonicity and Inter-Hierarchy Comparison
Abstract: Hierarchical Constraint Logic Programming languages extend ConstraintLogic Programming toinclude constraint hierarchies. These languages provide both requiredconstraints and default constraintsof various strengths. In the original definition of HCLP, alternatesolutions to a givenconstraint hierarchy were compared, and only the "best"solutions were returned. However, therewas no attempt to compare solutions arising from different choices ofrules in the logic program. Inmany practical applications of HCLP, to rule out unintuitivesolutions we do need to make such interhierarchy comparisons. Such comparisons introduce nonmonotonic behavior inHCLP programs. Wedefine two related nonmonotonicity properties of HCLP languages, andcompare these propertieswith those of standard nonmonotonic logics. The nonmonotonicityproperties create novel implementationproblems, which we discuss, while at the same time extending theusefulness of HCLPlanguages.Authors' addresses:Departmen...

Title: A framework for undoing actions in collaborative systems
Abstract: this paper, we propose a general framework for implementing undo incollaborative systems. The frameworkallows users to individually reverse their own changes, taking intoaccount the possibility of conflicts betweendifferent users' operations that may prevent an undo. The proposedframework has been incorporated intoDistEdit, a toolkit for building group text-editors. Based on ourexperience with DistEdit's undo facilities,we discuss several issues that need to be taken into account in usingthe framework, in order to ensure that areasonable undo behavior is provided to users. We show that theframework is also applicable to single-usersystems, since the operations to undo can be selected not just on thebasis of who performed them, but byany appropriate criterion, such as the document region in which theoperations occurred or the time intervalin which the operations were carried out.Categories and Subject Descriptors: D.2.2 [Software Engineering]:Tools and Techniques -- User Interfaces;H.1.2 [Models and Principles]: User/Machine Systems -- Human Factors;H.2.2 [Database

Title: Bayanihan: building and studying Web-based volunteer computing systems using Java
Abstract: Much of the current research in human-robot interaction is concernedwith single systems and single or few users. These systems and theirinterfaces are generally tightly-coupled and well-defined. Forlarge-scale humanrobot applications, the systems may be unknown priorto designing the interface for potential human interaction. Thispresents a difficult goal for allowing multiple users to interactwith many possibly unknown systems. In this paper, we present aninteraction infrastructure aligned with providing this interface. Itoperates in two phases that accommodate both many-to-many interactionand generalized, one-to-one interaction between users and roboticsystems. Our previous research has demonstrated the infrastructure toscale to a large number of users and several systems in simulation.The experiments in this paper substantiate these results in asmaller-scale real robotic environment.

Title: Zero-Copy TCP in Solaris
Abstract: This paper describes a new feature in Solaris that usesvirtual memory remapping combined with checksummingsupport from the networking hardware, to eliminatedata-touching overhead from the TCP/IPprotocol stack. By implementing page remappingoperations at the right level of the operating system,and caching MMU mappings to take advantage oflocality of reference, significant performance gain isattained on certain hardware platforms. Nevertheless,the performance improvement over CPU copying varies,depending on the host memory cache architecture,MMU design, and application behavior. We begin bycomparing different zero-copy schemes, and explainour preference for page remapping and copy-on-write(COW) techniques. We then describe our implementation,and present its performance characteristicsunder a number of different parameters. We concludewith ideas for future improvements.1.

Title: Where should the person stop and the information search interface start
Abstract: Many users of online and other automated information systems want totake advantage ofthe speed and power of automated retrieval, while still controllingand directing the steps of thesearch themselves. They do not want the system to take over and carryout the search entirelyfor them. Yet the objective of much of current theory andexperimentation in informationretrieval systems and interfaces is to design systems in which theuser has either no or onlyreactive involvement with the search process. It is argued here thatthe advanced informationretrieval research community is missing an opportunity to designsystems that are in betterharmony with the actual preferences of many users--sophisticatedsystems that provide anoptimal combination of searcher control and system retrieval power.The user may be provided effective means of directing the search ifcapabilities specific tothe information retrieval process, that is, strategic behaviorsnormally associated withinformation searching, are incorporated into the interface. There aremany questions concerning1) the degree of user vs. system involvement in the search, and 2)the size, or chunking, ofactivities, that is, how much and what type of activity the usershould be able to direct thesystem to do at once. These two dimensions are analyzed and a numberof configurations ofsystem capability that combine user and system control are presentedand discussed. In theprocess, the concept of the information search stratagem isintroduced, and particular attentionis paid to the provision of strategic, as opposed to purelyprocedural capabilities for thesearcher. Finally, certain of the types of user-system relationshipare selected as deserving2particular attention in future information retrieval system d...

As interface workhas increasingly become a focus of attention for the social sciences,we have expanded our appreciation ofthe importance of issues such as work practice, adaptation andevolution in interactive systems.The reorientation in our view of interactive systems has beenaccompanied by a call for a new model ofdesign centred around user needs and participation. This paper arguesthat a new process of design is notenough, and that the new view necessitates a similar reorientation inthe structure of the systems we build.It outlines some requirements for systems which support a deeperconception of interaction, and argues thatthe traditional system design techniques are not suited to creatingsuch systems.

Title: Usability Analysis of Visual Programming Environments: A 'Cognitive Dimensions' Framework
Abstract: this paper we shall describe a less detailed approach, specificallyintended to be useful outside the specialist world of HCI. We haveapplied this `cognitive dimensions' framework to a selection ofdifferent enduser programming environments [1]. The frameworkdescribes about a dozen dimensions, or cognitivelyrelevant aspects,of a programming environment (or of any other kind of system). Formost people the concepts employed will be immediately recognizablebut will not have been named before; explicitly listing and namingthe dimensions gives designers a better chance to avoid oversightsand can improve the level of critical discourse by providing a sharedvocabulary. What determines usability? Glinert ([2], p. 170 ff) haselegantly stated the need for investigation of cognitive issuesrelated to programming environment design for non-textual languages.However, he distinguished only two cognitive aspects: ease oflearning and system understandability. These are important but quiteinsufficient. A programming language may be easy to learn and easy tounderstand, but its environment may make it unusable. Usability isdetermined by a whole complex of cognitive factors. Each of thevarious tasks that make up programming must be easy enough to do,including learning the language, creating the design, coding it,checking, modification, comprehension, and explanation. (There arealso many non-cognitive issues, some inter-personal and somearchitectural, that we shall not discuss.) Moreover, the particularcontext deter- 2

We show how to apply these principles for theworkbenchenvironment and describe many issues encountered during thedesign. We first develop a framework for two-handed interaction andthen explore a variety of two-handed 3D tools and interactivetechniques. Related issues include how constraints are implementedand controlled by the two hands and how transitions betweenone-handedandtwo-handed tasks occur seemlessly. Informal observationsof the system in practice show that users can perform navigation andmanipulation tasks easily and with little training using thetwo-handed environment. One of our interesting findings was thatusers often performed two-handed manipulations by combining twootherwise independent o...

Abstract: Currently, building a user interface involves creating a largeprocedural program. Modelbasedprogramming provides an alternative new paradigm. In the model-basedparadigm,developers create a declarative model that describes the tasks thatusers are expected toaccomplish with a system, the functional capabilities of a system,the style andrequirements of the interface, the characteristics and preferences ofthe users, and the I/Otechniques supported by the delivery platform. Based on the model, amuch smallerprocedural program then determines the behavior of the system.There are several advantages to this approach. The declarative modelis a commonrepresentation that tools can reason about, enabling the constructionof tools that automatevarious aspects of interface design, that assist system builders inthe creation of themodel, that automatically provide context sensitive help and otherrun-time assistance tousers.

Title: The MOL Project: An Open Extensible Metacomputer
Abstract: Distributed high-performance computing---so-calledmetacomputing---refers to the coordinated use of a poolof geographically distributed high-performance computers.The user's view of an ideal metacomputer is thatof a powerful monolithic virtual machine. The implementor's view, on the other hand, is that of a varietyof interacting services implemented in a scalable andextensible manner.In this paper, we present MOL, the MetacomputerOnline environment. In contrast to other metcomputingenvironments, MOL is not based on specific programmingmodels or tools. It has rather been designedas an open, extensible software system comprising avariety of software modules, each of them specialized inserving one specific task such as resource scheduling,job control, task communication, task migration, userinterface, and much more. All of these modules existand are working. The main challenge in the design ofMOL lies in the specification of suitable, generic interfacesfor the effective ...

Title: The System Architect's Workbench
Abstract: This paper presents an overview of The SystemArchitect's Workbench, a behavioral synthesis systemunder development at Carnegie Mellon University. Thissystem converts an abstract behavioral description of apiece of hardware into a set of register-transfercomponents and a control sequence table. Two synthesismethodologies are supported: one is tuned specifically todesign microprocessors, and the other supports a moregeneral design style. Results are presented here for bothapproaches.IntroductionRecently, considerable research effort has beendirected toward the synthesis of register transfer leveldesigns from abstract behavioral descriptions[McFarland86, Pangrle86, Parker86, Paulin86]. Each ofthese efforts has defined a behavioral representation thatdescribes only the function of a system to be built, much inthe same way that a software program describes only afunction.

Title: Towards adaptive Web sites: conceptual framework and case study
Abstract: The creation of a complex web site is a thorny problem in userinterface design. In this paper we explore the notion of adaptive websites: sites that semi-automatically improve their organization andpresentation by learning from visitor access patterns. It is easy toimagine and implement web sites that offer shortcuts to popularpages. Are more sophisticated adaptive web sites feasible? Whatdegree of automation can we achieve? To address the questions above,we describe the design space of adaptive web sites and consider acase study: the problem of synthesizing new index pages thatfacilitate navigation of a web site. We present the PageGatheralgorithm, which automatically identifies candidate link sets toinclude in index pages based on user access logs. We demonstrateexperimentally that PageGather outperforms the Apriori data miningalgorithm on this task. In addition, we compare PageGather's linksets to pre-existing, human-authored index pages.

Title: Eye tracking in advanced interface design
Abstract: INTRODUCTION The problem of human-computer interaction can be viewedas two powerful information processors (human and computer)attempting to communicate with each other via a narrowbandwidth,highly constrained interface [23]. To address it, we seek faster,more natural, and more convenient means for users and computers toexchange information. The user's side is constrained by the nature ofhuman communication organs and abilities; the computer's isconstrained only by input/output devices and interaction techniquesthat we can invent. Current technology has been stronger in thecomputer-to-user direction than user-to-computer, hence today'suser-computer dialogues are rather one-sided, with the bandwidth fromthe computer to the user far greater than that from user to computer.Using eye movements as a user-tocomputer communication medium canhelp redress this imbalance.

Title: An overview of the epic architecture for cognition and performance with    application to human-computer interaction
Abstract: Thisarticle provides an overview of the EPIC architecture being developedbyKieras and Meyer for modeling human cognition and performance(Kieras, Wood, & Meyer, 1997; Meyer & Kieras, 1997a, 1997b).EPIC issimilar in spirit to the Model Human Processor (MHP; Card, Moran,&Newell, 1983), but EPIC incorporates many recent theoretical andempiri-cal results about human performance in the form of a softwareframeworkfor computer simulation modeling. Using EPIC, a model can be con-structed that represents the general procedures required to perform acomplex multimodal task a a set of production rules. When the modelissupplied with the external stimuli for a specffic task, it will thenexecutethe procedures in whatever way the task requires, thus simulating ahuman's performing the task and generating the predicted actions insimulatedreal time. EPIC is an architecture for constructing models of394performance. It is notet a learning system and so has no mechanismsforlearning how to perform a task.

Title: 3-Dimensional Pliable Surfaces: For the Effective Presentation of Visual Information
Abstract: A fundamental issue in user interface design is the effectiveuse of available screen space, commonly referred to asthe screen real estate problem. This paper presents a newdistortion-based viewing tool for exploring large informationspaces through the use of a three-dimensional pliable surface.Arbitrarily-shaped regions (foci) on the surface may be selectedand pulled towards or pushed away from the viewerthereby increasing or decreasing the level of detail containedwithin each region. Furthermore, multiple foci are smoothlyblended together such that there is no loss of context. Themanipulation and blending of foci is accomplished using afairly simple mathematical model based on gaussian curves.The significance of this approach is that it utilizes precognitiveperceptual cues about the three-dimensional surface tomake the distortions comprehensible, and allows the user tointeractively control the location, shape, and extent of thedistortion in very large graphs or maps....

Title: Generating and Solving Imperfect Information Games
Abstract: Work on game playing in AI has typically ignoredgames of imperfect information such as poker. Inthis paper, we present a framework for dealing withsuch games. We point out several important issuesthat arise only in the context of imperfect informationgames, particularly the insufficiency of asimple game tree model to represent the players'information state and the need for randomization inthe players' optimal strategies. We describe Gala,an implemented system that provides the user with avery natural and expressive language for describinggames. From a game description, Gala creates anaugmented game tree with information sets whichcan be used by various algorithms in order to findoptimal strategies for that game. In particular, Galaimplements the first practical algorithm for findingoptimal randomized strategies in two-player imperfectinformation competitive games [Koller et al.,1994] .

Title: Two Pointer Input for 3D Interaction
Abstract: We explore a range of techniques that use two hands to control twoindependent cursors to perform operations in 3D desktop applications.Based on research results in 2D applications, we believe thattwo-handed input provides the potential for creating more efficientand more fluid interfaces, especially for tasks that arecontext-sensitive or that have many degrees of freedom. These tasksappear frequently in 3D applications and are commonly broken downinto a series of sequential operations, each controlling fewerdegrees of freedom -- even though this may dramatically change thecharacter of the task. However, two-handed interaction, in theory,makes it possible to perform the same tasks using half the number ofsequential steps since two previously sequential operations can beperformed simultaneously. In addition, many forms of two-handedinteraction may be simpler to use and to understand since theycorrespond to common interactions in the physical world. It issignificant when ta...

Title: StarT-jr: A Parallel System from Commodity Technology
Abstract: StarT-jr is an experimental parallel system composed of a network ofpersonal computers (PCs). The system leverages the momentum of themicroprocessor and PC industries to achieve excellent single nodeperformance at a low cost. For parallel processing, StarT-jr uses theFlexible User-level Network Interface (FUNi) to provide low-overhead,user-level interprocessor communication over two IEEE 1394 High SpeedSerial Busses. This efficient message-passing mechanism enablesStarT-jr to exploit fine-grained parallelism for good parallelperformance. FUNi is based on an embedded coprocessor on a standardPCI card. Custom network hardware assembled from off-the-shelf 1394silicon provides the FUNi coprocessor with direct access to the 1394network. In order to avoid the long latency of accessing PCI devicesfrom the host processor, FUNi's message-passing interface utilizessoftware-managed message buffers in the host memory.

Abstract: New network technology continues to improve both the latency andbandwidth of communication in computer clusters. The fastesthigh-speed networks approach or exceed the I/O bus bandwidths of"gigabitready " hosts. These advances introduce newconsiderations for the design of network interfaces and messagingsystems for low-latency communication. This paper investigatescut-through delivery, a technique for overlapping host I/O DMAtransfers with network traversal. Cut-through delivery significantlyreduces end-to-end latency of large messages, which are oftencritical for application performance. We have implemented cut-throughdelivery in Trapeze, a new messaging substrate for network memory andother distributed operating system services. Our current Trapezeprototype is capable of demand-fetching 8K virtual memory pages in200s across a Myrinet cluster of DEC AlphaStations. 1.

Title: The Lorel query language for semistructured data
Abstract: . We present the Lorel language, designed for querying semistructureddata. Semistructured data is becoming more and more prevalent, e.g.,in structured documents such as HTML and when performing simpleintegration of data from multiple sources. Traditional data modelsand query languages are inappropriate, since semistructured dataoften is irregular: some data is missing, similar concepts arerepresented using different types, heterogeneous sets are present, orobject structure is not fully known. Lorel is a user-friendlylanguage in the SQL/OQL style for querying such data effectively. Forwide applicability, the simple object model underlying Lorel can beviewed as an extension of the ODMG data model and the Lorel languageas an extension of OQL. The main novelties of the Lorel language are:(i) the extensive use of coercion to relieve the user from the stricttyping of OQL, which is inappropriate for semistructured data

The data resides in differentforms, ranging from unstructured data in file systems to highlystructured in relational database systems.

Some of it hasstructure even if the structure is often implicit, and not as rigidor regular as that found in standard database systems. Sometimes thestructure exists but has to be extracted from the data. Sometimesalso it exists but we prefer to ignore it for certain purposes suchas browsing.

First, we present an optimalsmoothing algorithm for achieving the greatest possible reductionin rate variability when transmitting stored video to a client withgiven buffer size. We provide a formal proof of optimality, anddemonstrate the performance of the algorithm on a set of longMPEG-1 encoded video traces. Second, we evaluate the impactof optimal smoothing on the network resources needed for videotransport, under two network service models: Deterministic Guaranteedservice [1, 11] and Renegotiated CBR(RCBR) service [9, 8].Under both models, we find the impact of optimal smoothing to bedramatic.1 Introductio...

Title: RAP: An End-to-End Rate-Based Congestion Control Mechanism for Realtime Streams in the Internet
Abstract: End-to-end congestion control mechanisms have been critical to therobustness and stability of the Internet. The majority of today'sInternet traffic is TCP, and we expect this to remain a largeproportion of traffic in the future. Thus, having"TCP-friendly" behavior is crucial for new applications.However, the emergence of non-congestion-controlled realtimeapplications threatens unfairness to competing TCP traffic andpossible congestion collapse. We present an end-to-end TCP-friendlyRate Adaptation Protocol (RAP), which employs an additiveincrease,multiplicative-decrease (AIMD) algorithm. It is well suited forunicast playback of realtime streams and other semi-reliablerate-based applications. Its primary goal is to be fair and inparticular TCP-friendly while separating network congestion controlfrom application-level reliability. We evaluate RAP through extensivesimulation, and conclude that bandwidth is usually evenly sharedbetween TCP and RAP traffic. Unfairness to TCP ...

Abstract: Information retrieval (IR) has changed considerably in the last yearswith the expansion of the Web (World Wide Web) and the advent ofmodern and inexpensive graphical user interfaces and mass storagedevices. As a result, traditional IR textbooks have become quiteout-of-date which has led to the introduction of new IR booksrecently. Nevertheless, we believe that there is still great need ofa book that approaches the field in a rigorous and complete way froma computer-science perspective (in opposition to a user-centeredperspective). This book is an effort to partially fulfill this gapand should be useful for a first course on information retrieval aswell as for a graduate course on the topic.

Title: Querying Documents in Object Databases
Abstract: . We consider the problem of storing and accessing documents (SGMLand HTML, in particular) using database technology. To specify thedatabase image of documents, we use structuring schemas that consistin grammars annotated with database programs. To query documents, weintroduce an extension of OQL, the ODMG standard query language forobject databases. Our extension (named OQL-doc) allows to querydocuments without a precise knowledge of their structure using inparticular generalized path expressions and pattern matching. Thisallows us to introduce in a declarative language (in the style of SQLor OQL), navigational and information retrieval styles of accessingdata. Query processing in the context of documents and pathexpressions leads to challenging implementation issues. We extend anobject algebra with new operators to deal with generalized pathexpressions. We then consider two essential complementaryoptimization techniques: 1. we show that almost standard databaseoptimiz...

Title: Compact Representations of Videos Through Dominant and Multiple Motion Estimation
Abstract: An explosion of on-line image and video data in digital form isalready well underway. With the exponential rise in interactiveinformation exploration and dissemination through the WorldWide Web(WWW), the major inhibitors of rapid access to on-line video data arecosts and management of capture and storage, lack of real-timedelivery, and non-availability of contentbased intelligent search andindexing techniques. The solutions for capture, storage and deliverymaybe on the horizon or a little beyond. However, even with rapiddelivery, the lack of efficient authoring and querying tools forvisual content-based indexing may still inhibit as widespread a useof video information as that of text and traditional tabular data iscurrently. In order to be able to non-linearly browse and index intovideos through visual content, it is necessary to develop authoringtools that can automatically separate moving objects and significantcomponents of the scene, and represent these in a compact ...

Abstract: The transfer of prerecorded, compressed video requires multimediaservices to support large fluctuations in bandwidth requirements onmultiple time scales. Bandwidth smoothing techniques can reduce theburstiness of a variable -bit-rate stream by prefetching data at aseries of fixed rates, simplifying the allocation of resources invideo servers and the communication network. Given a fixed clientsideprefetch buffer, several bandwidth smoothing algorithms have beenintroduced that are provably optimal under certain constraints. Thispaper presents a collection of metrics for comparing these smoothingalgorithms and evaluating their cost-performance trade-offs. Due tothe scarcity of available trace data, we have constructed a videocapture testbed and generated a collection of twenty full-length,motion-JPEG encoded video clips. Using these video traces and a rangeof client buffer sizes, we investigate the interplay between theperformance metrics through simulation experiments. The ...

Title: Text Classification from Labeled and Unlabeled Documents using EM
Abstract: . This paper shows that the accuracy of learned text classifiers canbe improved byaugmenting a small number of labeled training documents with a largepool of unlabeled documents.This is important because in many text classification problemsobtaining training labelsis expensive, while large quantities of unlabeled documents arereadily available.We introduce an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeleddocuments based on thecombination of Expectation-Maximization (EM) and a naive Bayesclassifier. The algorithm firsttrains a classifier using the available labeled documents, andprobabilistically labels the unlabeleddocuments. It then trains a new classifier using the labels for allthe documents, and iteratesto convergence. This basic EM procedure works well when the dataconform to the generativeassumptions of the model. However these assumptions are oftenviolated in practice, and poorperformance can result. We present two extensions to the algorithmthat improve ...

Title: MindReader: Querying Databases Through Multiple Examples
Abstract: Users often can not easily express theirqueries. For example, in a multimedia/imageby content setting, the user might want photographswith sunsets; in current systems,like QBIC, the user has to give a samplequery, and to specify the relative importanceof color, shape and texture. Even worse,the user might want correlations between attributes,like, for example, in a traditional,medical record database, a medical researchermight want to find "mildly overweight patients", where the implied query would be"weight/height  4 lb/inch".Our goal is to provide a user-friendly, buttheoretically solid method, to handle suchqueries. We allow the user to give severalexamples, and, optionally, their 'goodness'scores, and we propose a novel method to"guess" which attributes are important, whichcorrelations are important, and with whatweight.Our contributions are twofold: (a) we formalizethe problem as a minimization problemand show how to solve for the optimal solution,complete...

Title: The Conceptual Basis for Mediation Services
Abstract: Mediator modules comprise a layer of intelligent middleware servicesin informationsystems, linking data resources and application programs. Earlierprograms that ledto the concept of mediation were either constructed to supportspecific applicationsor provided extended services from databases. Intelligent mediatorsare being builtnow by careful domain knowledge acquisition and hand crafting therequired code.In this paper we present the conceptual underpinning for automatingthe mediationprocess. Automation does not extend to fully automatic codegeneration,since additional knowledge is necessary to provide added value. Thegeneration conceptis based on the extraction of a hierarchical domain model out of thegeneralnetwork representing the available resources. Associated with themethod are domainontologies. Ontologies list the terms used by the models, anddocument theirrelationships. These terms provide the semantic foundation needed toperform thegeneration.This paper...

Title: Data Exploration Using Self-Organizing Maps
Abstract: Finding structures in vast multidimensional data sets, be theymeasurement data, statistics, or textual documents, is difficult andtime-consuming. Interesting, novel relations between the data itemsmay be hidden in the data. The selforganizing map (SOM) algorithm ofKohonen can be used to aid the exploration: the structures in thedata sets can be illustrated on special map displays. In this work,the methodology of using SOMs for exploratory data analysis or datamining is reviewed and developed further. The properties of the mapsare compared with the properties of related methods intended forvisualizing highdimensional multivariate data sets. In a set of casestudies the SOM algorithm is applied to analyzingelectroencephalograms, to illustrating structures of the standard ofliving in the world, and to organizing full-text documentcollections. Measures are proposed for evaluating the quality ofdifferent types of maps in representing a given data set, and formeasuring the robu...

Title: Merging Ranks from Heterogeneous Internet Sources
Abstract: Many sources on the Internet and elsewhere rank the objects in queryresults according to how well these objects match the original query.For example, a real-estate agent might rank the available housesaccording to how well they match the user's preferred location andprice. In this environment, "meta-brokers" usually querymultiple autonomous, heterogeneous sources that might use varyingresult-ranking strategies. A crucial problem that a meta-broker thenfaces is extracting from the underlying sources the top objects for auser query according to the meta-broker's ranking function. Thisproblem is challenging because these top objects might not be rankedhigh by the sources where they appear. In this paper we discussstrategies for solving this "meta-ranking" problem. Inparticular, we present a condition that a source must satisfy so thata meta-broker can extract the top objects for a query from the sourcewithout examining its entire contents.

Title: Copy detection mechanisms for digital documents
Abstract: In a digital library system, documents are available in digital formand therefore are moreeasily copied and their copyrights are more easily violated. This isa very serious problem, as itdiscourages owners of valuable information from sharing it withauthorized users. There are twomain philosophies for addressing this problem: prevention anddetection. The former actuallymakes unauthorized use of documents difficult or impossible while thelatter makes it easier todiscover such activity.In this paper we propose a system for registering documents and thendetecting copies,either complete copies or partial copies. We describe algorithms forsuch detection, and metricsrequired for evaluating detection mechanisms (covering accuracy,efficiency, and security). Wealso describe a working prototype, called COPS, describeimplementation issues, and presentexperimental results that suggest the proper settings for copydetection parameters.1 IntroductionDigital libraries are a conc...

Title: Boolean Query Mapping Across Heterogeneous Information Sources
Abstract: Searching over heterogeneous information sources is difficult becauseof the non-uniform querylanguages. Our approach is to allow a user to compose Boolean queriesin one rich front-end language. Foreach user query and target source, we transform the user query into asubsuming query that can be supportedby the source but that may return extra documents. The results arethen processed by a filter query to yield thecorrect final result. In this paper we introduce the architecture andassociated algorithms for generating thesupported subsuming queries and filters. We show that generatedsubsuming queries return a minimal numberof documents; we also discuss how minimal cost filters can beobtained. We have implemented prototypeversions of these algorithms and demonstrated them on heterogeneousBoolean systems.Index Terms---Boolean queries, query translation, informationretrieval, heterogeneity, digital libraries,query subsumption, filtering.I.

Title: Dynamic Distance Maps of the Internet
Abstract: There is an increasing number of Internet applications that attemptto optimize their network communication by considering the networkdistance across which data is transferred. Such applications rangefrom replication management to mobile agent applications. One majorproblem of these applications is to efficiently acquire distanceinformation for large computer networks. This paper presents anapproach to create a global view on the Internet, a so-called networkdistance map, which realizes a hierarchical decomposition of thenetwork into regions and which allows to estimate the networkdistance between any two hosts. This view is not only a singlesnapshot but is dynamically adapted to the continuously changingnetwork conditions. The main idea is to use a certain set of hostsfor performing distance measurements and to use the so gainedinformation for estimating the distance between arbitrary hosts. Ahierarchical clustering provides the notion of regions and allows tocoordinate th...

Title: On wrapping query languages and efficient XML integration
Abstract: Modern applications/portals, e-commerce, digital libraries, etc.)require integrated access to various information sources (fromtraditional RDBMS to semistructured Web repositories), fastdeployment and low maintenance cost in a rapidly evolvingenvironment. Because of its flexibility, there is an increasinginterest in using XML as a middleware model for such applications.XML enables fast wrapping and declarative integration. However, queryprocessing in XML-based integration systems is still penalized by thelack of an algebra with adequate optimization properties and thedifficulty to understand source query capabilities. In this paper, wepropose an algebraic approach to support efficient query evaluationin XML integration systems. We define a general purpose algebrasuitable for semistructured or XML query languages. We showhow thisalgebra can be used, with appropriate type information, to also wrapmore structured query languages such as OQL or SQL. Finally,wedevelop new optimizat...

Abstract: The problem of modeling semi-structured data is important inmany application areas such as multimedia data management,biological databases, digital libraries, and data integration.Graph schemas (Buneman et al. 1997) have been proposedrecently as a simple and elegant formalism for representingsemistructured data. In this model, schemas are representedas graphs whose edges are labeled with unary formulae ofa theory, and the notions of conformance of a database toa schema and of subsumption between two schemas are definedin terms of a simulation relation. Several authors havestressed the need of extending graph schemas with varioustypes of constraints, such as edge existence and constraintson the number of outgoing edges. In this paper we analyzethe appropriateness of various knowledge representation formalismsfor representing and reasoning about graph schemasextended with constraints.

Abstract: We propose a self-organizing archival Intermemory. That is, anoncommercial subscriber-provided distributed information storageservice built on the existing Internet. Given an assumption ofcontinued growth in the memory's total size, a subscriber'sparticipation for only a finite time can nevertheless ensure archivalpreservation of the subscriber's data. Information disperses throughthe network over time and memories become more difficult to erase asthey age. The probability of losing an old memory given random nodefailures is vanishingly small -- and an adversary would have tocorrupt hundreds of thousands of nodes to destroy a very old memory.This paper presents a framework for the design of an Intermemory, andconsiders certain aspects of the design in greater detail. Inparticular, the aspects of addressing, space efficiency, andredundant coding are discussed.

Thereis not atProximalNodes: A Model to Query Document Databases by Contents andStructure \Delta 3this time, to the best of our knowledge, any approach satisfying bothgoals (see,however, a recent work [Dao et al. 1996]). We first concentrate ontext and latershow how to integrate other types of data (e.g. audio, images, etc.).These mediaare becoming more and more common in document databases.It has been argued that is better to put a layer integrating atraditional databasesystem with a textual one, than trying to design a languagecomprising all thefeatures [Sacks-Davis et al. 1994]. Each subsystem focuses on adifferent part ofthe query (e.g. integration of an object-oriented database with astructured textengine [Consens and Milo 1994]).We rely on this approach. We design a language which is focused onexploitingstructure- and content-related features. Other features, such astuples and joins,should be added by integrating this language with another oneoriented to thatkind of operations, e.g. a relational database.We point out what are we not covering in this work.First, we do not cover languages to describe document structure, suchas SGML[International Standards Organization 1986], DSSSL [InternationalStandards Organization1994], SPDL [International Standards Organization 1991], HyTime[InternationalStandards Organization 1992], etc. We cover structuring models (e.g.hierarchical).

Abstract: A growing number of real-time applications (e.g., real-time controls,and audio/video conferencing)require certain quality-of-service (QoS) from the underlyingcommunication subsystem. Real-timecommunication services are needed in the communication subsystem(host as well as network) toprovide the required QoS to these applications while providingreasonably good performance forbest-effort traffic. At the host, real-time communicationnecessitates that shared host resourcessuch as CPU and link bandwidth be consumed according to the relativerequirements of the activeconnections. This requires appropriate resource management policiesfor admission controland scheduling that are typically formulated assuming idealizedresource models. However, whenimplementing these policies one must account for the performancecharacteristics of the hardwareand software components involved, which could deviate significantlyfrom those of the idealizedresource models.In this paper, we focus on...

Continuing our prior work incompressed video manipulation, we also propose to explore thepossibility of deriving visual features directly from the compresseddomain, such as the DCT and wavelet transform domain. By stressing atthe low-level features, we hope to achieve generic techniquesapplicable to general applications. By exploring thecompressed-domain content extractability, we hope to reduce thecomputational complexity. We also propose a quad-tree based datastructure to bind various signal features. Integrated feature mapsare proposed to improve the overall effectiveness of thefeature-based image query system. Current technical progress andsystem prototypes are also descr...

Title: The HyperDisco Approach to Open Hypermedia Systems
Abstract: Computing support for large engineering enterprises providesan example of the need for hypermedia-based collaborativecomputing systems composed of a large numberof distributed heterogeneous tools. These computingenvironments place complex requirements on the underlyinghypermedia platform. To support integrationof independently written tools for these environments,hypermedia platforms must address several importantissues such as scalability, openness, distribution, heterogeneity,interoperability, extensibility and computation.This paper describes the HyperDisco approach to openhypermedia systems. HyperDisco provides an extensibleobject-oriented hypermedia platform supporting intertoollinking, computation, concurrency control, notificationcontrol, version control, access control, query andsearch, and various other features. The present work hastwo main objectives: 1) to provide a platform to integrateexisting and future distributed heterogeneous toolsand data formats an...

Title: Discovering Typical Structures of Documents: A Road Map Approach
Abstract: The structure of a document refers to the role and hierarchy ofsubdocument references. Many online documents are similarlystructured, though not identically structured. We study the problemof discovering "typical" structures of a collection of suchdocuments, where the user specifies the minimum frequency of atypical structure. We will consider structural features ofsubdocument references such as labeling, nesting, ordering,cyclicity, and wild-card references, like those found on the Web anddigital libraries. Typical structures can be used to serve thefollowing purposes. (a) The "table-ofcontent " for gainingthe general information of a source. (b) A road map for browsing andquerying a source. (c) A basis for clustering documents. (d) Partialschemas for building structured layers to provide standard databaseaccess methods. (e) User/customer's interests and browsing patterns.We present a solution to the discovery problem. 1 Introduction 1.1Motivation Many on-line documen...

Title: Building a Scalable and Accurate Copy Detection Mechanism
Abstract: Often, publishers are reluctant to offer valuable digital documentson the Internet for fear that they will be re-transmittedor copied widely. A Copy Detection Mechanism can helpidentify such copying. For example, publishers may registertheir documents with a copy detection server, and the servercan then automatically check public sources such as UseNetarticles and Web sites for potential illegal copies. The servercan search for exact copies, and also for cases where significantportions of documents have been copied. In this paperwe study, for the first time, the performance of variouscopy detection mechanisms, including the disk storage requirements,main memory requirements, response times forregistration, and response time for querying. We also contrastperformance to the accuracy of the mechanisms (howwell they detect partial copies). The results are obtained usingSCAM, an experimental server we have implemented,and a collection of 50,000 netnews articles.1 Introducti...

Abstract: Bibliographic records freely available on the Internet can be used toconstruct a highquality,digital finding aid that provides the ability to discover paper andelectronicdocuments. The key challenge to providing such a service isintegrating mixed-qualitybibliographic records, coming from multiple sources and in multipleformats. Thisthesis describes an algorithm that automatically identifies recordsthat refer to thesame work and clusters them together; the algorithm clusters recordsfor which bothauthor and title match. It tolerates errors and cataloging variationswithin the recordsby using a full-text search engine and an n-gram-based approximatestring matchingalgorithm to build the clusters. The algorithm identifies more than90 percent of therelated records and includes incorrect records in less than 1 percentof the clusters.It has been used to construct a 250,000-record collection of thecomputer scienceliterature.

Abstract: Information triage is the process of sorting through relevantmaterials, and organizing them to meet the needs of the task at hand.It is a practice that has become increasingly common with the adventof "at your fingertips" information resources. To explorethe characteristics of information triage and its interaction withspatial hypertext, a medium we claim supports the process, we havestudied subjects engaged in a time-constrained decision-making taskusing a large set of relevant documents. We use the study task toinvestigate information triage under three different conditions: onein which the participants used paper documents, and two others inwhich the participants used variants of VIKI, a spatial hypertextsystem. Our findings suggest that during information triageattentional resources are devoted to evaluating materials andorganizing them, so they can be read and reread as they return tomind. Accordingly, hypertext tools to support the practice shouldfa...

Title: Dynamic Multi-Resource Load Balancing in Parallel Database Systems
Abstract: Parallel database systems have to support the effectiveparallelization of complex queries in multi-user mode, i.e. incombination with inter-query/inter-transaction parallelism. For thispurpose, dynamic scheduling and load balancing strategies arenecessary that consider the current system state for determining thedegree of intra-query parallelism and for selecting the processorsfor executing subqueries. We study these issues for parallel hashjoin processing and show that the two subproblems should be addressedin an integrated way. Even more important, however, is the use of amulti-resource load balancing approach that considers all potentialbottleneck resources, in particular memory, disks and CPU. We discussbasic performance tradeoffs to consider and evaluate the performanceof several load balancing strategies by means of a detailedsimulation model. Simulation results will be analyzed for multiuserconfigurations with both homogeneous and heterogeneous (query/OLTP)workloa...

We outline the main components of an intelligent filesystem that optimizes striping by taking into account therequirements of the applications, and performs load balancing byjudicious file allocation and dynamic redistributions of the datawhen access patterns change. Our system uses simple but effectiveheuristics that incur only little overhead. We present performanceexperiments based on synthetic workloads and real-life traces.

Abstract: In recent years, we have seen a tremendous growth in the volume oftext documents available on the Internet, digital libraries, newssources, and company-wide intranets. This has led to an increasedinterest in developing methods that can efficiently categorize andretrieve relevant information. Retrieval techniques based ondimensionality reduction, such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI),have been shown to improve the quality of the information beingretrieved by capturing the latent meaning of the words present in thedocuments. Unfortunately, the high computational requirements of LSIand its inability to compute an effective dimensionality reduction ina supervised setting limits its applicability. In this paper wepresent a fast dimensionality reduction algorithm, called conceptindexing (CI) that is equally effective for unsupervised andsupervised dimensionality reduction.

Title: Rewriting of Regular Expressions and Regular Path Queries
Abstract: Recent work on semi-structured data has revitalized the interest inpath queries, i.e., queries that ask for all pairs of objects in thedatabase that are connected by a path conforming to a certainspecification, in particular to a regular expression. Also, insemi-structured data, as well as in data integration, datawarehousing, and query optimization, the problem of query rewritingusing views is receiving much attention: Given a query and acollection of views, generate a new query which uses the views andprovides the answer to the original one. In this paper we address theproblem of query rewriting using views in the context ofsemi-structured data. We present a method for computing the rewritingof a regular expression E in terms of other regular expressions. Themethod computes the exact rewriting (the one that defines the sameregular language as E) if it exists, or the rewriting that definesthe maximal language contained in the one defined by E, otherwise.

Title: The AQUA Approach to Querying Lists and Trees in Object-Oriented Databases
Abstract: Relational database systems and most objectorienteddatabase systems provide support for queries.Usually these queries represent retrievals over sets ormultisets. Many new applications for databases, suchas multimedia systems and digital libraries, need supportfor queries on complex bulk types such as listsand trees. In this paper we describe an object-orientedquery algebra for lists and trees. The operators in thealgebra preserve the ordering between the elements of alist or tree, even when the result list or tree contains anarbitrary set of nodes from the original tree. We alsopresent predicate languages for lists and trees whichallow order-sensitive queries because they use patternmatching to examine groups of list or tree nodes ratherthan individual nodes. The ability to decompose predicatepatterns enables optimizations that make use ofindices.1 IntroductionDatabase query languages have primarily focusedon sets (and sometimes multisets) while in this paperwe en...

For an alternative schemewe suggest an explorative full-text information retrieval method,where the Self-Organizing Map (SOM)algorithm is used to order documents based on their full textualcontents. The visualized order can then beutilized for an explorative search or exploration of novel knowledgeareas, whereby the scope can be changedinteractively. The ordering of the documents is achieved by atwo-level analysis: First, word categories areextracted from the text by a "semantic" SOM. Second, thetextual context of the documents is encoded onthe basis of the histograms of words formed on the word category map.1 IntroductionThe information age is characterized by an uncontrolled flood ofmiscel...

Thewavelet coefficients in the lowest few frequency bands, and theirvariances, are stored as feature vectors. To speed up retrieval, atwo-step procedure is used that first does a crude selection based onthe variances, and then renes the search by performing a featurevector match between the selected images and the query. For betteraccuracy in searching, two-level multiresolution matching may also beused. Masks are used for partial-sketch queries.

Consequently, mostimplementations of polymorphic languages box data (i.e., represent anobject as a pointer), leading to inefficiencies. We introduce a newcompilation method for polymorphic languages that avoids the problemsassociated with boxing data. The fundamental idea is to relax therequirement that code selection for primitive, polymorphicoperations, such as pairing and projection, must be performed atcompile time. Instead, we allow such operations to defer codeselection until link- or even run-time when the types of the valuesare known. We formalize our approach as a translation into anexplicitly-typed, predicative polymorphic - calculus with intensionalpolymorphism. By "intensional polymorphism", we mean thatconstructors and terms can be ...

Title: A distributed object model for the Java System
Abstract: We show a distributed object model for the Java^TM1System [1,6] (hereafter referred to simply as "Java")that retains as much of the semantics of the Java objectmodel as possible, and only includes differenceswhere they make sense for distributed objects. Thedistributed object system is simple, in that a) distributedobjects are easy to use and to implement, and b)the system itself is easily extensible and maintainable.We have designed such a model and implemented asystem that supports remote method invocation (RMI)for distributed objects in Java. This system combinesaspects of both the Modula-3 Network Objects system[3] and Spring's subcontract [8] and includes somenovel features.To achieve its goal of seamless integration in the language,the system exploits the use of pickling [14] totransmit arguments and return values and also exploitsunique features of Java in order to dynamically loadstub code to clients2.

Title: Region-Based Memory Management
Abstract: This paper describes a memory management discipline for programsthat perform dynamic memory allocation and de-allocation. At runtime,all values are put into regions. The store consists of a stack ofregions.All points of region allocation and deallocation are inferredautomatically,using a type and effect based program analysis. The scheme does notassume the presence of a garbage collector.The scheme was first presented by Tofte and Talpin (1994);subsequently,it has been tested in The ML Kit with Regions, a region-based,garbage-collection free implementation of the Standard ML Corelanguage,which includes recursive datatypes, higher-order functions andupdatablereferences (Birkedal et al. 96, Elsman and Hallenberg 95).This paper defines a region-based dynamic semantics for a skeletalprogramminglanguage extracted from Standard ML. We present the inferencesystem which specifies where regions can be allocated andde-allocated anda detailed proof that the system is sound wi...

Title: Pointer Swizzling at Page Fault Time: Efficiently and Compatibly Supporting Huge Address Spaces on Standard Hardware
Abstract: Pointer swizzling at page fault time is a noveladdress translation mechanism that exploits conventionaladdress translation hardware. It can supporthuge address spaces efficiently without long hardwareaddresses; such large address spaces are attractive forpersistent object stores, distributed shared memories,and shared address space operating systems. Thisswizzling scheme can be used to provide data compatibilityacross machines with different word sizes,and even to provide binary code compatibility acrossmachines with different hardware address sizes.Pointers are translated ("swizzled") from a long formatto a shorter hardware-supported format at pagefault time. No extra hardware is required, and no continualsoftware overhead is incurred by presence checksor indirection of pointers. This pagewise technique exploitstemporal and spatial locality in much the sameway as a normal virtual memory; this gives it manydesirable performance characteristics, especially giventhe tr...

Title: Software Write Detection for a Distributed Shared Memory
Abstract: Most software-based distributed shared memory (DSM) systems rely onthe operating system's virtual memory interface to detect writes toshared data. Strategies based on virtual memory page protectioncreate two problems for a DSM system. First, writes can have highoverhead since they are detected with a page fault. As a result, apage must be writtenmany times to amortize the cost of that fault.Second, the size of a virtual memory page is too big to serve as aunit of coherency, inducing false sharing. Mechanisms to handle falsesharing can increase runtime overhead and may cause data to beunnecessarily communicated between processors. In this paper, wepresent a new method for write detection that solves these problems.Our method relies on the compiler and runtime system to detect writesto shared data without invoking the operating system. We measure andcompare implementations of a distributed shared memory system usingboth strategies, virtual memory and compiler /runtime, runn...

Title: Simple Generational Garbage Collection and Fast Allocation
Abstract: Generational garbage collection algorithms achieve efficiency becausenewer records point to older records; the only way an older recordcan point to a newer record is by a store operation to apreviously-created record, and such operations are rare in manylanguages. A garbage collector that concentrates just on recentlyallocated records can take advantage of this fact. Such a garbagecollector can be so efficient that the allocation of records costsmore than their disposal. A scheme for quick record allocationattacks this bottleneck. Many garbage-collected environments don'tknow when to ask the operating system for more memory. A robustheuristic solves this problem. This paper presents a simple,efficient, low-overhead version of generational garbage collectionwith fast allocation, suitable for implementation in a Unixenvironment.

Title: Lazy Replication: Exploiting the Semantics of Distributed Services
Abstract: To provide high availability for services such as mail or bulletinboards, data must be replicated. One way to guarantee consistency ofreplicated data is to force service operations to occur in the sameorder at all sites, but this approach is expensive. In this paper, wepropose lazy replication as a way to preserve consistency byexploiting the semantics of the service's operations to relax theconstraints on ordering. Three kinds of operations are supported:operations for which the clients define the required orderdynamically during the execution, operations for which the servicedefines the order, and operations that must be globally ordered withrespect to both client ordered and service ordered operations. Themethod performs well in terms of response time, amount of storedstate, number of messages, and availability. It is especially wellsuited to applications in which most operations require only theclient-defined order.

Title: Typed Closure Conversion
Abstract: We study the typing properties of closure conversion for simply-typedand polymorphic -calculi. Unlike most accounts of closure conversion,which only treat the untyped -calculus, we translate well-typedsource programs to well-typed target programs. This allows latercompiler phases to take advantage of types for representationanalysis and tag-free garbage collection, and it facilitatescorrectness proofs. Our account of closure conversion for thesimply-typed language takes advantage of a simple model of objects bymapping closures to existentials. Closure conversion for thepolymorphic language requires additional type machinery, namelytranslucency in the style of Harper and Lillibridge's modulecalculus, to express the type of a closure. 1 Introduction The usualoperational models of programming languages based on the -calculuscompute by substituting terms for variables in other terms.

Title: A Semantic Model of Reference Counting and its Abstraction (Detailed Summary)
Abstract: Interpretation of Reference CountingThe semantics presented thus far is exact, and thus evaluating aparticular reference count maynot terminate, any more than a program in the standard semanticswould. For use by a compilerwe must choose a suitable abstraction (i.e., approximation) that willguarantee termination yetstill provide useful information about the true reference counts. Forus a suitable abstraction isone in which the inferred reference count is at least as great as thetrue one; i.e., we wish toerr on the side of thinking there are more pointers to an object thanthere actually are. In thissection we methodically develop such an abstraction in which: (1) thebase domains are abstractedto powersets of finite approximations, (2) the primitive functionsare abstracted similarly, (3) anabstract interpretation is thus induced on R p and R, and finally (4)a collecting interpretation ofexpressions is developed.4.1 PreliminariesTo set up things to come, we first gi...

This method has been used to construct a mostlyparallel trace-and-sweep collector that exhibits very short pausetimes. Performance measurements are given. 1. Introduction Garbagecollection is an important feature of many modern computingenvironments. There are basically two styles of garbage collectionalgorithms: reference-counting collectors and tracing collectors. Inthis paper we consider only tracing collectors. A straightforwardimplementation of tracing collection prevents any client action fromoccurring while the tracing operation is performed.

One way toguarantee consistency of replicated data is to force serviceoperations to occur in the same order at all sites, but thisapproach is expensive. For some applications a weaker causaloperation order can preserve consistency whileproviding better performance. This paper describes a new way ofimplementing causal operations. Our techniquealso supports two other kinds of operations: operations that aretotally ordered with respect to one another, andoperations that are totally ordered with respect to all otheroperations. The method performs well in terms ofresponse time, operation processing capacity, amount of stored state,and number and size of messages; it doesbetter than replication methods based on reliable multicasttechniques.This research was supported in part by the National ScienceFoundation under Grant CCR-8822158 and in part bythe Advanced Research Projects ...

Title: Virtually-Synchronous Communication Based on a Weak Failure Suspector
Abstract: Thispaper shows that a FS with very weak semantics (i.e. that deliversfailure and recoveryinformation in no specific order) suffices to implementvirtually-synchronouscommunication (VSC) in an asynchronous system subject to processcrash failuresand network partitions. The VSC paradigm is particularly useful inasynchronoussystems and greatly simplifies building fault-tolerant applicationsthat mask failuresby replicating processes. We suggest a three-component architectureto implementvirtually-synchronous communication : 1) at the lowest level, the FScomponent; ontop of it, 2a) a component that defines new views, and 2b) acomponent that reliablymulticasts messages within a view.1 Introduction

Forthe measured load levels the Squid proxy used at least as many CPU,memory, and disk resources as CERN, in some configurationssignificantly more resources. At higher load levels the resourceutilization requirements will cross and Squid will be the one usingfewer resources.

Title: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance
Abstract: Our growing reliance on online services accessible on the Internetdemands highly-available systemsthat provide correct service without interruptions. Byzantine faultssuch as software bugs, operatormistakes, and malicious attacks are the major cause of serviceinterruptions. This thesis describesa new replication algorithm, BFT, that can be used to buildhighly-available systems that tolerateByzantine faults. It shows, for the first time, how to buildByzantine-fault-tolerant systems that canbe used in practice to implement real services because they do notrely on unrealistic assumptionsand they perform well. BFT works in asynchronous environments likethe Internet, it incorporatesmechanisms to defend against Byzantine-faulty clients, and itrecovers replicas proactively. Therecovery mechanism allows the algorithm to tolerate any number offaults over the lifetime of thesystem provided fewer than 1=3 of the replicas become faulty within asmall window of vulnerability.The window may increase under a denial-of-service attack but thealgorithm can detect and respondto such attacks and it can also detect when the state of a replica iscorrupted by an attacker.

The mathematical runtimemodel of region inference uses a stack of regions, each ofwhich can contain an unbounded number of values. Thispaper is concerned with mapping the mathematical modelonto real machines. This is done by composing region inferencewith Region Representation Inference, which graduallyrefines region information till it is directly implementable onconventional von Neumann machines.

Title: Representing control in the presence of first-class continuations
Abstract: Languages such as Scheme and Smalltalk that provide continuations asfirst-class data objects present a challenge to efficientimplementation. Allocating activation records in a heap has provenunsatisfactory because of increased frame linkage costs, increasedgarbage collection overhead, and decreased locality of reference.However, simply allocating activation records on a stack and copyingthem when a continuation is created results in unbounded copyingoverhead. This paper describes a new approach based on stackallocation that does not require the stack to be copied when acontinuation is created and that allows us to place a small upperbound on the amount copied when a continuation is reinstated. Thisnew approach is faster than the naive stack allocation approach, andit does not suffer from the problems associated with unboundedcopying. For continuation-intensive programs, our approach is atworst a constant factor slower than the heap allocation approach, andfor typical programs, it is significantly faster. An importantadditional benefit is that recovery from stack overflow is handledgracefully and efficiently.

Title: The Measured Cost of Conservative Garbage Collection
Abstract: this paper, I evaluate the costs ofdifferent dynamic storage management algorithms, includingdomain-specific allocators, widelyusedgeneral-purpose allocators, and a publicly available conservativegarbage collection algorithm.Surprisingly, I find that programmer enhancements often have littleeffect on program performance.I also find that the true cost of conservative garbage collection isnot the CPU overhead,but the memory system overhead of the algorithm. I conclude thatconservative garbage collectionis a promising alternative to explicit storage management and thatthe performance of conservativecollection is likely to improve in the future. C programmers shouldnow seriously consider usingconservative garbage collection instead of explicitly calling free inprograms they write

Title: Efficient Memory-based Learning for Robot Control
Abstract: This dissertation is about the application of machine learning torobot control. A system which has no initial model of the robot/worlddynamics should be able to construct such a model using data receivedthrough its sensors--an approach which is formalized here as the $AB(State-Action-Behaviour) control cycle. A method of learning ispresented in which all the experiences in the lifetime of the robotare explicitly remembered. The experiences are stored in a mannerwhich permits fast recall of the closest previous experience to anynew situation, thus permitting very quick predictions of the effectsof proposed actions and, given a goal behaviour, permitting fastgeneration of a candidate action. The learning can take place inhigh-dimensional non-linear control spaces with real-valued ranges ofvariables. Furthermore, the method avoids a number of shortcomings ofearlier learning methods in which the controller can become trappedin inadequate performance which does not improve. Also considered ishow the system is made resistant to noisy inputs and how it adapts toenvironmental changes. A well founded mechanism for choosing actionsis introduced which solves the experiment/perform dilemma for thisdomain with adequate computational efficiency, and with fastconvergence to the goal behaviour. The dissertation explefins indetail how the $AB control cycle can be integrated into both low andhigh complexity tasks. The methods and algorithms are evaluated withnumerous experiments using both real and simulated robot domefins.The final experiment also illustrates how a compound learning taskcan be structured into a hierarchy of simple learning tasks.

Title: Dependence Based Prefetching for Linked Data Structures
Abstract: We introduce a dynamic scheme that captures the access patternsof linked data structures and can be used to predictfuture accesses with high accuracy. Our technique exploitsthe dependence relationships that exist between loads thatproduce addresses and loads that consume these addresses.By identifying producer-consumer pairs, we construct acompact internal representation for the associated structureand its traversal. To achieve a prefetching effect, a smallprefetch engine speculatively traverses this representationahead of the executing program. Dependence-basedprefetching achieves speedups of up to 25% on a suite ofpointer-intensive programs.1 IntroductionLinked data structures (LDS) such as lists and trees are used inmany important applications. The importance of LDS is growingwith the increasing popularity of C++, Java, and other systems thatuse linked object graphs and function tables.

Title: Operational Aspects of Linear Lambda Calculus
Abstract: Linear logic is a resource-aware logic that is based on an analysisof the classical proof rules of contraction (copying) and weakening(throwing away). Several previous researchers have studied functionalprogramming languages derived from linear logic according to the"formulas-as-types" correspondence. In languages withlinear logic types, one may hope that traditional implementationproblems in functional languages such as update in place could besimplified by careful use of the type system. In this paper, we provethat the standard sequent calculus proof system of linear logic isequivalent to a natural deduction style proof system. Using thenatural deduction system, we investigate the pragmatic problems oftype inference and type safety for a linear lambda calculus. Althoughterms do not have a single most-general type (for either the standardsequent presentation or our natural deduction formulation), there isa set of most-general types that may be computed usingunification....

Title: Space-Efficient Closure Representations
Abstract: Many modern compilers implement function calls (or returns)in two steps: first, a closure environment is properlyinstalled to provide access for free variables in the targetprogram fragment; second, the control is transferred to thetarget by a "jump with arguments (or results)." Closureconversion, which decides where and how to represent closuresat runtime, is a crucial step in compilation of functionallanguages. We have a new algorithm that exploits the useof compile-time control and data flow information to optimizeclosure representations. By extensive closure sharingand allocating as many closures in registers as possible, ournew closure conversion algorithm reduces heap allocationby 36% and memory fetches for local/global variables by43%; and improves the already-efficient code generated bythe Standard ML of New Jersey compiler by about 17% on aDECstation 5000. Moreover, unlike most other approaches,our new closure allocation scheme satisfies the strong "safefor sp...

Abstract: The work habits of most individuals yield file access patterns thatare quitepronounced and can be regarded as defining working sets of files usedfor particularapplications. This paper describes a client-side cache managementtechnique fordetecting these patterns and then exploiting them to successfullyprefetch files fromservers. Trace-driven simulations show the technique substantiallyincreases the hitrate of a client file cache in an environment in which a clientworkstation is dedicatedto a single user. Successful file prefetching carries three majoradvantages: (1) applicationsrun faster, (2) there is less "burst" load placed on thenetwork, and (3)properly-loaded client caches can better survive network outages. Ourtechnique requireslittle extra code, and --- because it is simply an augmentation ofthe standardLRU client cache management algorithm --- is easily incorporated intoexistingsoftware.This work is supported by the New York State Science and TechnologyFo...

Title: Typed Memory Management in a Calculus of Capabilities
Abstract: An increasing number of systems rely on programming languagetechnology to ensure safety and security of low-levelcode. Unfortunately, these systems typically rely on a complex,trusted garbage collector. Region-based type systemsprovide an alternative to garbage collection by making memorymanagement explicit but verifiably safe. However, it hasnot been clear how to use regions in low-level, type-safe code.We present a compiler intermediate language, called theCapability Calculus, that supports region-based memorymanagement, enjoys a provably safe type system, and isstraightforward to compile to a typed assembly language.Source languages may be compiled to our language usingknown region inference algorithms. Furthermore, region lifetimesneed not be lexically scoped in our language, yet thelanguage may be checked for safety without complex analyses.Finally, our soundness proof is relatively simple, employingonly standard techniques.The central novelty is the use of static...

Title: Better Static Memory Management: Improving Region-Based Analysis of Higher-Order Languages
Abstract: Static memory management replaces runtime garbage collection withcompile-time annotations that make all memory allocationand deallocation explicit in a program. We improve upon theTofte/Talpin region-based scheme for compile-time memorymanagement [TT94]. In the Tofte/Talpin approach, all values,including closures, are stored in regions. Region lifetimes coincidewith lexical scope, thus forming a runtime stack of regions andeliminating the need for garbage collection. We relax therequirement that region lifetimes be lexical. Rather, regions areallocated late and deallocated as early as possible by explicitmemory operations. The placement of allocation and deallocationannotations is determined by solving a system of constraintsthat expresses all possible annotations. Experiments show that ourapproach reduces memory requirements significantly, in somecases asymptotically.1 IntroductionIn a recent paper, Tofte and Talpin propose a novel method for memorymanagement in type...

The first protocol (WFS)adapts based on write-write false sharing; the second(WFS+WG) based on a combination of write-writefalse sharing and write granularity. The adaptation isautomatic. No user or compiler information is needed.The choice between SW and MW is made on a perpagebasis.We measured the performance of our adaptive protocolson an 8-node SPARC cluster connected by a155 Mbps ATM network. We used eight applications,covering a broad spectrum in terms of write-writefalse sharing and write granularity. We compare ouradaptive protocols against the MW-only and the SWonlyapproach. Adaptation to write-write false sharingproves to be the critical performance factor, whileadaptation to write granularity plays only a secondaryrole in our environment and for the applications considered.Each of the tw...

Title: Hardware and Software Support for Efficient Exception Handling
Abstract: Program-synchronous exceptions, for example, breakpoints,watchpoints, illegal opcodes, and memory access violations, provideinformation about exceptional conditions, interrupting the programand vectoring to an operating system handler. Over the last decade,however, programs and run-time systems have increasingly employedthese mechanisms as a performance optimization to detect normal andexpected conditions. Unfortunately, current architecture andoperating system structures are designed for exceptional or erroneousconditions, where performance is of secondary importance, rather thannormal conditions. Consequently, this has limited the practicality ofsuch hardware-based detection mechanisms. We propose both hardwareand software structures that permit efficient handling of synchronousexceptions by user-level code.

Proofnets are translated into graphs of the sort used in optimal -calculus implementations; computation is performedby simple graph rewriting. This graph implementationhelps in understanding optimal reductionsin the -calculus and in the various programming languagesinspired by linear logic.1 Beyond the -calculusThe -calculus is not entirely explicit about the operationsof erasing and duplicating arguments. Theseoperations are important both in the theory of the -calculus and in its implementations, yet they are typicallytreated somewhat informally, implicitly.

Abstract: Many operating systems allow user programs to specify the protectionlevel (inaccessible, read-only, read-write) of pages in their virtualmemory address space, and to handle any protection violations thatmay occur. Such page-protection techniques have been exploited byseveral user-level algorithms for applications including generationalgarbage collection and persistent stores. Unfortunately, modernhardware has made efficient handling of page protection faults moredifficult. Moreover, page-sized granularity may not match the naturalgranularity of a given application. In light of these problems, wereevaluate the usefulness of pageprotection primitives in suchapplications, by comparing the performance of implementations thatmake use of the primitives with others that do not.

To assist the collector, we extend thecompiler to emit tables describing live pointers, and valuesderived from pointers, at each program location where collectionmay occur. Significant results include identificationof a number of problems posed by optimizations, solutions tothose problems, a working compiler, and experimental dataconcerning table sizes, table compression, and time overheadof decoding tables during collection. While gc support canaffect the code produced, our sample programs show no significantchanges, the table sizes are a modest fraction of thesize of the optimized code, and stack tracing is a small fractionof total gc time. Since the compiler enhancements arealso modest, we conclude that the approach is...

Our measurements of these interpreters relateperformance to the complexity of the interpreter's virtual machineand demonstrate that native runtime libraries can play a key rolein providing good performance. From an architectural perspective,we show that interpreter performance is primarily a function of theinterpreter itself and is relatively independent of the applicationbeinginterpreted.

Title: The Incremental Garbage Collection of Processes
Abstract: This paper investigates some problems associated with an argumentevaluation order that we call "future' order, which is differentfrom both call-by-name and call-by-value. In call-by-future, eachformal parameter of a function is bound to a separate process (calleda "future") dedicated to the evaluation of thecorresponding argument. This mechanism allows the fully parallelevaluation of arguments to a function, and has been shown to augmentthe expressive power of a language. We discuss an approach to aproblem that arises in this context: futures which were thought to berelevant when they were created become irrelevant through beingignored in the body of the expression where they were bound. Theproblem of irrelevant processes also appears in multiprocessingproblem-solving systems which start several processors working on thesame problem but with different methods, and return with the solutionwhich finishes first. This parallel method strategy has the drawbackthat the processes which are investigating the losing methods must beidentified, stopped, and reassigned to more useful tasks. Thesolution we propose is that of garbage collection. We propose thatthe goal structure of the solution plan be explicitly represented inmemory as part of the graph memory (like Lisp's heap) so that agarbage collection algorithm can discover which processes areperforming useful work, and which can be recycled for a new task. Anincremental algorithm for the unified garbage collection of storageand processes is described.

We conducted a study of the memorysubsystem performance of heap allocation for memory subsystems foundon many machines. We found that many machines support heap allocationpoorly. However, with the appropriate memory subsystem organization,heap allocation can have good memory subsystem performance. 1Introduction Heap allocation with copying garbage collection iswidely believed to have poor memory subsystem performance [31, 38,39, 24, 40].

Theprograms, compiled with the SML/NJ compiler [3], do tremendousamounts of heap allocation, allocating one word every to 4 to 10instructions. The programs used a generational copying garbagecollector to manage their heaps. To our surprise, The authors ...

Title: Partition selection policies in object database garbage collection
Abstract: The automatic reclamation of storage for unreferenced objects is veryimportant in object databases. Existing language system algorithmsfor automatic storage reclamation have been shown to beinappropriate. In this paper, we investigate methods to improve theperformance of algorithms for automatic storage reclamation of objectdatabases. These algorithms are based on a technique calledpartitioned garbage collection, in which a subset of the entiredatabase is collected independently of the rest. Specifically, weinvestigate the policy that is used to select what partition in thedatabase should be collected. The new partition selection policiesthat we propose and investigate are based on the intuition that thevalues of overwritten pointers provide good hints about where to findgarbage. Using trace-driven simulation, we show that one of ourpolicies requires less I/O to collect more garbage than any existingimplementable policy and performs close to animpractical-to-implement bu...

Title: Towards Alias-Free Pointers
Abstract: . This paper argues that pointer-induced aliasing can be avoidedin many cases by means of a concept of unique pointer. The use ofsuchpointers is expected to fortify the concept of encapsulation, to makesystemseasier to reason about, to provide better control over theinteractionbetween threads, and to make storage management safer and moreefficient.We show that unique pointers can be implemented by means offew minor and virtually costless modifications in conventional OOlanguages,such as Eiffel or C++; and that they can be used convenientlyin a broad range of algorithms and data structures.Key Words and Phrases: pointer-induced aliasing, hiding,encapsulation,programming with threads, storage management.?Work supported by NSF grant No. CCR-9308773.1 IntroductionDynamic objects, i.e., objects allocated on the heap and addressed bymeansof pointers, are widely considered a mixed blessing in imperativeprogramming.A blessing, because dynamic objects have some very ...

Title: Reference Counting as a Computational Interpretation of Linear Logic
Abstract: We develop formal methods for reasoning about memory usage at a levelof abstraction suitable for establishing or refuting claims about thepotential applications of linear logic for static analysis. Inparticular, we demonstrate a precise relationship between typecorrectness for a language based on linear logic and the correctnessof a reference-counting interpretation of the primitives that thelanguage draws from the rules for the `of course' operation. Oursemantics is `low-level' enough to express sharing and copying whilestill being `highlevel ' enough to abstract away from details ofmemory layout. This enables the formulation and proof of a resultdescribing the possible run-time reference counts of values of lineartype.

Title: Lightweight Logging for Lazy Release Consistent Distributed Shared Memory
Abstract: This paper presents a new logging and recoveryalgorithm for lazy release consistent distributed sharedmemory (DSM). The new algorithm tolerates singlenode failures by maintaining a distributed log of datadependencies in the volatile memory of processes.The algorithm adds very little overhead to thememory consistency protocol: it sends no additionalmessages during failure-free periods; it adds only aminimal amount of data to one of the DSM protocolmessages; it introduces no forced rollbacks ofnon-faulty processes; and it performs nocommunication-induced accesses to stable storage.Furthermore, the algorithm logs only a very smallamount of data, because it uses the log of memoryaccesses already maintained by the memory consistencyprotocol.The algorithm was implemented in TreadMarks, astate-of-the-art DSM system. Experimental results showthat the algorithm has near zero time overhead and verylow space overhead during failure-free execution, thusrefuting the common belie...

Title: Memory Management with Explicit Regions
Abstract: Much research has been devoted to studies of and algorithmsfor memory management based on garbage collectionor explicit allocation and deallocation. An alternativeapproach, region-based memory management,has been known for decades, but has not been wellstudied.In a region-based system each allocation specifiesa region, and memory is reclaimed by destroyinga region, freeing all the storage allocated therein. Weshow that on a suite of allocation-intensive C programs,regions are competitive with malloc/free and sometimessubstantially faster. We also show that regions supportsafe memory management with low overhead. Experiencewith our benchmarks suggests that modifyingmany existing programs to use regions is not difficult.1 IntroductionThe two most popular memory management techniquesare explicit allocation and deallocation, asin C's malloc/free, and various forms of garbagecollection[Wil92]. Both have well-known advantagesand disadvantages, discussed further below. A t...

Title: Fixing the Java Memory Model
Abstract: The Java memory model described in Chapter 17 of theJava Language Specification gives constraints on howthreads interact through memory. The Java memorymodel is hard to interpret and poorly understood; itimposes constraints that prohibit common compiler optimizationsand are expensive to implement on existinghardware. At least one shipping optimizing Java compilerviolates the constraints of the existing Java memorymodel. These issues are particularly important forhigh-performance Java applications, since they are morelikely to use and need aggressive optimizing compilersand parallel processors.In addition, programming idioms used by some programmersand used within Sun's Java Development Kitis not guaranteed to be valid according the existing Javamemory model.This paper reviews these issues and suggests replacementmemory models for Java.1 IntroductionThe Java memory model, as described in chapter 17 ofthe Java Language Specification [GJS96], is very hardto unders...

Abstract: Higher order functional programs constantly allocateobjects dynamically. These objects are typically conscells, closures, and records and are generally allocatedin the heap and reclaimed later by some garbage collectionprocess. This paper describes a compile timeanalysis, called escape analysis, for determining thelifetime of dynamically created objects in higher orderfunctional programs, and describes optimizationsthat can be performed, based on the analysis, to improvestorage allocation and reclamation of such objects.In particular, our analysis can be applied toprograms manipulating lists, in which case optimizationscan be performed to allow whole cons cells inspines of lists to be either reclaimed at once or reusedwithout incurring any garbage collection overhead. Ina previous paper on escape analysis [10], we had leftopen the problem of performing escape analysis onlists.Escape analysis simply determines when the argument(or some part of the argument) to a func...

Abstract: In previous work, we presented Typed Assembly Language (TAL). TAL issufficiently expressive to serve as a target language for compilersof high-level languages such as ML.

However,most compilers are based on stack allocation. This paper presentsSTAL, an extension of TAL with stack constructs and stack types tosupport the stack allocation style.

Title: A comparative performance evaluation of write barrier implementations
Abstract: Generational garbage collectors are able to achieve very small pausetimes by concentrating on the youngest (most recently allocated)objects when collecting, since objects have been observed to dieyoung in many systems. Generational collectors must keep track of allpointers from older to younger generations, by "monitoring"all stores into the heap. This write barrier has been implemented ina number of ways, varying essentially in the granularity of theinformation observed and stored. Here we examine a range of writebarrier implementations and evaluate their relative performancewithin a generation scavenging garbage collector for Smalltalk.

This thesis addresses the theory and practice oftransparent faulttolerancemethods using message logging and checkpointing in distributedsystems. Ageneral model for reasoning about the behavior and correctness ofthese methods isdeveloped, and the design, implementation, and performance of two newlow-overheadmethods based on this model are presented.

Title: Space Efficient Conservative Garbage Collection
Abstract: We call a garbage collector conservative if it has only partialinformation about the location of pointers, and is thus forced totreat arbitrary bit patterns as though they might be pointers, in atleast some cases. We show that some very inexpensive, but previouslyunused techniques can have dramatic impact on the effectiveness ofconservative garbage collectors in reclaiming memory. Our mostsignificant observation is that static data that appears to point tothe heap should not result in misidentified references to the heap.The garbage collector has enough information to allocate around suchreferences. We also observe that programming style has a significantimpact on the amount of spuriously retained storage, typically evenif the collector is not terribly conservative. Some fairly common Cand C programming styles significantly decrease the effectiveness ofany garbage collector. These observations suffice to explain some ofthe different assessments of conservative collection that haveappeared in the literature.

The persistenceabstraction hides the physical properties of data from the programsthat manipulate it.

This article introduces a class of incremental learning proceduresspecializedfor prediction---that is, for using past experience with anincompletely knownsystem to predict its future behavior. Whereas conventionalprediction-learning methodsassign credit by means of the difference between predicted and actualoutcomes, thenew methods assign credit by means of the difference betweentemporally successivepredictions. Although such temporal-difference methods have been usedin Samuel'schecker player, Holland's bucket brigade, and the author's AdaptiveHeuristic Critic,they have remained poorly understood. Here we prove their convergenceand optimalityfor special cases and relate them to supervised-learning methods. Formost real-worldprediction problems, temporal-difference methods require less memoryand less peakcomputation than conventional methods; and they produce more accuratepredictions.We argue that most problems to which supervised learning is currentlyapplied ar...

Title: The Laplacian Pyramid as a compact image code
Abstract: We describe a technique for image encoding in whichlocal operators of many scales but identical shape serve as the basisfunctions. The representation differs from established techniques inthat the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well asinspace.Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting alowpassfiltered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a netdata compression since the difference, or error, image has lowvariance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may representedat reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved byquantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated tocompress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process atappropriatelyexpanded scales generates a pyramid data structure.The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image withLaplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhancesalient image features. A further advantage of the present code istha...

Abstract: No feature-based vision system can work unless good features can beidentified and tracked from frame to frame. Although tracking itselfis by and large a solved problem, selecting features that can betracked well and correspond to physical points in the world is stillhard. We propose a feature selection criterion that is optimal byconstruction because it is based on how the tracker works, and afeature monitoring method that can detect occlusions, disocclusions,and features that do not correspond to points in the world. Thesemethods are based on a new tracking algorithm that extends previousNewton-Raphson style search methods to work under affine imagetransformations.

Abstract: The Hausdorff distance measures the extent to which each point of a`model' set lies near some point of an `image' set and vice versa.Thus this distance can be used to determine the degree of resemblancebetween two objects that are superimposed on one another. In thispaper we provide efficient algorithms for computing the Hausdorffdistance between all possible relative positions of a binary imageand a model. We focus primarily on the case in which the model isonly allowed to translate with respect to the image. Then we considerhow to extend the techniques to rigid motion (translation androtation). The Hausdorff distance computation differs from many othershape comparison methods in that no correspondence between the modeland the image is derived. The method is quite tolerant of smallposition errors as occur with edge detectors and other featureextraction methods. Moreover, we show how the method extendsnaturally to the problem of comparing a portion of a model against ani...

However, conventional PCA does not correspond to aprobability density, and so there is no unique way to combine PCAmodels.

This leads to a well-definedmixture model for probabilistic principal component analysers, whoseparameters can be determined using an EM algorithm.

Title: Beyond Independence: Conditions for the Optimality of the Simple Bayesian Classifier
Abstract: The simple Bayesian classifier (SBC) is commonly thought to assumethat attributes are independent given the class, but this isapparently contradicted by the surprisingly good performance itexhibits in many domains that contain clear attribute dependences. Noexplanation for this has been proposed so far. In this paper we showthat the SBC does not in fact assume attribute independence, and canbe optimal even when this assumption is violated by a wide margin.The key to this finding lies in the distinction betweenclassification and probability estimation: correct classification canbe achieved even when the probability estimates used contain largeerrors. We show that the previously-assumed region of optimality ofthe SBC is a second-order infinitesimal fraction of the actual one.This is followed by the derivation of several necessary and severalsufficient conditions for the optimality of the SBC. For example, theSBC is optimal for learning arbitrary conjunctions and disjunction...

Abstract: With the goal of reducing computational costswithout sacrificing accuracy, we describe two algorithmsto find sets of prototypes for nearestneighbor classification. Here, the term "prototypes" refers to the reference instances used ina nearest neighbor computation --- the instanceswith respect to which similarity is assessed inorder to assign a class to a new data item. Bothalgorithms rely on stochastic techniques to searchthe space of sets of prototypes and are simple toimplement.

Title: The TV-Tree: An Index Structure for High-Dimensional Data
Abstract: We propose a file structure to index high-dimensionality data,typically, points in some feature space. The idea is to use only afew of the features, utilizing additional features whenever theadditional discriminatory power is absolutely necessary. We presentin detail the design of our tree structure and the associatedalgorithms that handle such `varying length' feature vectors. Finallywe report simulation results, comparing the proposed structure withthe R -tree, which is one of the most successful methods forlow-dimensionality spaces. The results illustrate the superiority ofour method, with up to 80% savings in disk accesses. Type ofContribution: New Index Structure, for high-dimensionality featurespaces.

Title: A Fast Algorithm for Incremental Distance Calculation
Abstract: A simple and efficient algorithm for finding the closestpoints between two convex polyhedra is describedhere. Data from numerous experiments tested on abroad set of convex polyhedra on !3show that therunning time is roughly constant for finding closestpoints when nearest points are approximately knownand is linear in total number of vertices if no specialinitialization is done. This algorithm can be used forcollision detection, computation of the distance betweentwo polyhedra in three-dimensional space, andother robotics problems. It forms the heart of themotion planning algorithm of [1].1 IntroductionIn this paper we present a simple method for findingand tracking the closest points on a pair of convexpolyhedra. The method is generally applicable, butis especially well suited to repetitive distance calculationas the objects move in a sequence of small, discretesteps. The method works by finding and maintainingthe pair of closest features (vertex, edge, orface)...

Title: A Theory of Networks for Approximation and Learning
Abstract: Learning an input-output mapping from a set of examples, of the typethat many neural networks have been constructed to perform, can beregarded as synthesizing an approximation of a multi-dimensionalfunction, that is solving the problem of hypersurface reconstruction.From this point of view, this form of learning is closely related toclassical approximation techniques, such as generalized splines andregularization theory. This paper considers the problems of an exactrepresentation and, in more detail, of the approximation of linearand nonlinear mappings in terms of simpler functions of fewervariables. Kolmogorov's theorem concerning the representation offunctions of several variables in terms of functions of one variableturns out to be almost irrelevant in the context of networks forlearning. We develop a theoretical framework for approximation basedon regularization techniques that leads to a class of three-layernetworks that we call Generalized Radial Basis Functions (GR...

Abstract: Algorithms for learning classification trees have had successes inartificial intelligence and statisticsover many years.

Wealso discuss severalstatistical algorithms for assigning words to classes based on thefrequency of their cooccurrencewith other words. We find that we are able to extract classes thathave the flavor of eithersyntactically based groupings or semantically based groupings,depending on the nature of theunderlying statistics.1 IntroductionIn a number of natural language processing tasks, we face the problemof recovering a stringof English words after it has been garbled by passage through a noisychannel.

Title: The sample complexity of pattern classification with neural networks: the size of the weights is more important than the size of the network
Abstract: Sample complexity results from computational learning theory, whenapplied toneural network learning for pattern classification problems, suggestthat for good generalizationperformance the number of training examples should grow at leastlinearlywith the number of adjustable parameters in the network. Results inthis paper showthat if a large neural network is used for a pattern classificationproblem and thelearning algorithm finds a network with small weights that has smallsquared error onthe training patterns, then the generalization performance depends onthe size of theweights rather than the number of weights. For example, consider atwo-layer feedforwardnetwork of sigmoid units, in which the sum of the magnitudes of theweightsassociated with each unit is bounded by A and the input dimension isn. We showthat the misclassification probability is no more than a certainerror estimate (that isrelated to squared error on the training set) plus A3 p(log n)=m (ignori...

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for solving the perceptualgrouping problem in vision. Rather than focusingon local features and their consistencies in theimage data, our approach aims at extracting the globalimpression of an image. We treat image segmentationas a graph partitioning problem and propose anovel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmentingthe graph. The normalized cut criterion measuresboth the total dissimilarity between the different groupsas well as the total similarity within the groups. Weshow that an efficient computational technique basedon a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimizethis criterion. We have applied this approachto segmenting static images and found results very encouraging.1 IntroductionNearly 75 years ago, Wertheimer[17] launched theGestalt approach which laid out the importance ofperceptual grouping and organization in visual perception.For our purposes, the problem of groupingcan be well motivated by consider...

Title: Face Recognition Under Varying Pose
Abstract: Researchers in computer vision and pattern recognition have worked onautomatic techniques for recognizinghuman faces for the last 20 years. While some systems, especiallytemplate-based ones, have beenquite successful on expressionless, frontal views of faces withcontrolled lighting, not much work has takenface recognizers beyond these narrow imaging conditions. Our goal isto build a face recognizer that worksunder varying pose, the difficult part of which is to handle facerotations in depth. Building on successfultemplate-based systems (especially Brunelli and Poggio[7]), our basicapproach is to represent faces withtemplates from multiple model views that cover different poses fromthe viewing sphere. To recognize anovel view, the recognizer locates the eyes and nose features, usesthese locations to geometrically registerthe input with model views, and then uses correlation on modeltemplates to find the best match in thedata base of people.

Title: Bayesian Network Classifiers
Abstract: . Recent work in supervised learning has shown that a surprisinglysimple Bayesianclassifier with strong assumptions of independence among features,called naive Bayes, is competitivewith state-of-the-art classifiers such as C4.5. This fact raises thequestion of whether aclassifier with less restrictive assumptions can perform even better.In this paper we evaluateapproaches for inducing classifiers from data, based on the theory oflearning Bayesian networks.These networks are factored representations of probabilitydistributions that generalize the naiveBayesian classifier and explicitly represent statements aboutindependence. Among these approacheswe single out a method we call Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN),which outperformsnaive Bayes, yet at the same time maintains the computationalsimplicity (no search involved)and robustness that characterize naive Bayes. We experimentallytested these approaches, usingproblems from the University of California at Irvine reposi...

Title: Layered Representation for Motion Analysis
Abstract: Standard approaches to motion analysis assumethat the optic flow is smooth; such techniques havetrouble dealing with occlusion boundaries. The mostpopular solution is to allow discontinuities in the flowfield, imposing the smoothness constraint in a piecewisefashion. But there is a sense in which the discontinuitiesin flow are artifactual, resulting from theattempt to capture the motion of multiple overlappingobjects in a single flow field. Instead we can decomposethe image sequence into a set of overlapping layers,where each layer's motion is described by a smoothflow field. The discontinuities in the description arethen attributed to object opacities rather than to theflow itself, mirroring the structure of the scene. Wehave devised a set of techniques for segmenting imagesinto coherently moving regions using affine motionanalysis and clustering techniques. We are ableto decompose an image into a set of layers along withinformation about occlusion and depth ordering...

Abstract: A novel scene reconstruction technique is presented,different from previous approaches in its ability to copewith large changes in visibility and its modeling of intrinsicscene color and texture information. The methodavoids image correspondence problems by working in adiscretized scene space whose voxels are traversed in afixed visibility ordering. This strategy takes full accountof occlusions and allows the input cameras to be far apartand widely distributed about the environment. The algorithmidentifies a special set of invariant voxels which togetherform a spatial and photometric reconstruction of thescene, fully consistent with the input images. The approachis evaluated with images from both inward- and outwardfacingcameras.1 IntroductionWe consider the problem of acquiring photorealistic 3Dmodels of real environments from widely distributed viewpoints.This problem has sparked recent interest in thecomputer vision community [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] as a result ofnew ap...

Abstract: Induction variable detection is usually closely tied to the strengthreduction optimization. This paper studies induction variableanalysis from a different perspective, that of finding inductionvariables for data dependence analysis. While classical inductionvariable analysis techniques have been used successfully up to now,we have found a simple algorithm based on the the Static SingleAssignment form of a program that finds all linear inductionvariables in a loop. Moreover, this algorithm is easily extended tofind induction variables in multiple nested loops, to find nonlinearinduction variables, and to classify other integer scalar assignmentsin loops, such as monotonic, periodic and wraparound variables. Someof these other variables are now classified using ad hoc patternrecognition, while others are not analyzed by current compilers.Giving a unified approach improves the speed of compilers and allowsa more general classification scheme. We also show how to use theseva...

The resulting method is called variable-kernelsimilaritymetric (VSM) learning. It has been tested on several standardclassification data sets, and on these problems it shows bettergeneralizationthan back propagation and most other learning methods.An important advantage is that the system can operate as a blackbox in which no model minimization parameters need to beexperimentallyset by the user.

Abstract: A selective vision system sequentially collects evidence to support aspecified hypothesisabout a scene, as long as the additional evidence is worth the effortofobtaining it. Efficiency comes from processing the scene only wherenecessary, to thelevel of detail necessary, and with only the necessary operators.Knowledge representationand sequential decision-making are central issues for selectivevision, whichtakes advantage of prior knowledge of a domain's abstract andgeometrical structureand models for the expected performance and cost of visual operators.The TEA-1 selective vision system uses Bayes nets for representationand benefitcostanalysis for control of visual and non-visual actions.

Title: Eigenfaces vs. Fisherfaces: Recognition Using Class Specific Linear Projection
Abstract: We develop a face recognition algorithm which is insensitive to grossvariation inlighting direction and facial expression. Taking a patternclassification approach,we consider each pixel in an image as a coordinate in ahigh-dimensional space. Wetakeadvantage of the observation that the images of a particularface, under varyingillumination but fixed pose, lie in a 3-D linear subspace of the highdimensionalimage space -- if the face is a Lambertian surface without shadowing.However,since faces are not truly Lambertian surfaces and do indeed produceself-shadowing,images will deviate from this linear subspace. Rather than explicitlymodelingthis deviation, we linearly project the image into a subspace in amanner whichdiscounts those regions of the face with large deviation. Ourprojection method isbased on Fisher's Linear Discriminant and produces well separatedclasses in a lowdimensionalsubspace even under severe variation in lighting and facialexpressions.

Abstract: The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a new and very promisingclassification technique developed by Vapnik andhis group at AT&T Bell Laboratories [3, 6, 8, 24]. This newlearning algorithm can be seen as an alternative trainingtechnique for Polynomial, Radial Basis Function and Multi-LayerPerceptron classifiers. The main idea behind thetechnique is to separate the classes with a surface that maximizesthe margin between them. An interesting propertyof this approach is that it is an approximate implementation of theStructural Risk Minimization (SRM) inductionprinciple [23]. The derivation of Support Vector Machines, itsrelationship with SRM, and its geometrical insight,are discussed in this paper.Since Structural Risk Minimization is an inductive principle thataims at minimizing a bound on the generalizationerror of a model, rather than minimizing the Mean Square Error overthe data set (as Empirical Risk Minimizationmethods do), training a SVM to obtain the maximum margin c...

First, it is shownthat any learningalgorithm implementing the MIN-FEATURES bias requires \Theta(1ffl ln1ffi +1ffl [2p+ p ln n])training examples to guarantee PAC-learning a concept having prelevant features outof n available features. This bound is only logarithmic in the numberof irrelevantfeatures.For implementing the MIN-FEATURES bias, the paper presents fivealgorithmsthat identify a subset of features sufficient to construct ahypothesis consistent withthe training examples. FOCUS-1 is a straightforward algorithm thatreturns a minimaland sufficient subset of features in quasi-polynomial time. FOCUS-2does the same taskas FOCUS-1 but is empirically shown to be substantially faster thanFOCUS-1. Finally,the Simple-Greedy, Mutual-Information-G...

Title: Segmentation by grouping junctions
Abstract: We propose a method for segmenting gray-value images.By segmentation, we mean a map from the set of pixels toa small set of levels such that each connected componentof the set of pixels with the same level forms a relativelylarge and "meaningful" region. The method finds a set oflevels with associated gray values by first finding junctionsin the image and then seeking a minimum set of thresholdvalues that preserves the junctions. Then it finds a segmentationmap that maps each pixel to the level with theclosest gray value to the pixel data, within a smoothnessconstraint. For a convex smoothing penalty, we show theglobal optimal solution for an energy function that fits thedata can be obtained in a polynomial time, by a novel use ofthe maximum-flow algorithm. Our approach is in contrastto a view in computer vision where segmentation is drivenby intensity gradient, usually not yielding closed boundaries.1.

Title: The Power of Amnesia
Abstract: We propose a learning algorithm for a variable memory lengthMarkov process. Human communication, whether given as text,handwriting, or speech, has multi characteristic time scales. Onshort scales it is characterized mostly by the dynamics that generatethe process, whereas on large scales, more syntactic and semanticinformation is carried. For that reason the conventionallyused fixed memory Markov models cannot capture effectively thecomplexity of such structures. On the other hand using long memorymodels uniformly is not practical even for as short memory asfour. The algorithm we propose is based on minimizing the statisticalprediction error by extending the memory, or state length,adaptively, until the total prediction error is sufficiently small.Wedemonstrate the algorithm by learning the structure of naturalEnglishtext and applying the learned model to the correction of corruptedtext. Using less than 3000 states the model's performanceis far superior to that of fixe...

Title: MBT: A MemoryBased Part of Speech Tagger-Generator
Abstract: We introduce a memory-based approach to part of speech tagging.Memory-basedlearning is a form of supervised learning based on similarity-basedreasoning. The partof speech tag of a word in a particular context is extrapolated fromthe most similarcases held in memory. Supervised learning approaches are useful whena tagged corpusis available as an example of the desired output of the tagger. Basedon such a corpus,the tagger-generator automatically builds a tagger which is able totag new text thesame way, diminishing development time for the construction of atagger considerably.Memory-based tagging shares this advantage with other statistical ormachine learningapproaches. Additional advantages specific to a memory-based approachinclude (i) therelatively small tagged corpus size sufficient for training, (ii)incremental learning, (iii)explanation capabilities, (iv) flexible integration of information incase representations,(v) its non-parametric nature, (vi) reasonably ...

Title: Discriminant analysis by Gaussian mixtures
Abstract: Fisher-Rao linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a valuable tool formultigroup classification. LDA is equivalent to maximum likelihoodclassification assuming Gaussian distributions for each class. Inthis paper, we fitted Gaussian mixtures to each class to facilitateeffective classification in non-normal settings, especially when theclasses are clustered. Low dimensional views are an importantby-product of LDA---our new techniques inherit this feature. We areable to control the withinclass spread of the subclass centresrelative to the between-class spread. Our technique for fitting thesemodels permits a natural blend with nonparametric versions of LDA.Keywords: Classification, Pattern Recognition, Clustering,Nonparametric Regression, Radial Basis Functions. 1 Introduction Inthe generic classification or discrimination problem, the outcome ofinterest G falls into J unordered classes, which for convenience wedenote by the set J = f1; 2; 3; \Delta \Delta \Delta Jg.

Abstract: The appearance of a particular object depends onboth the viewpoint from which it is observed and thelight sources by which it is illuminated. If the appearanceof two objects is never identical for any pose orlighting conditions, then -- in theory -- the objects canalways be distinguished or recognized. The questionarises: What is the set of images of an object underall lighting conditions and pose? In this paper,we consider only the set of images of an object undervariable illumination (including multiple, extendedlight sources and attached shadows). We prove that theset of n-pixel images of a convex object with a Lambertianreflectance function, illuminated by an arbitrarynumber of point light sources at infinity, forms a convexpolyhedral cone in IRnand that the dimension ofthis illumination cone equals the number of distinctsurface normals. Furthermore, we show that the conefor a particular object can be constructed from threeproperly chosen images. Finally, we p...

Abstract: : This paper shows how to find both the weights and architecture fora neural network (including the number of layers, the number ofprocessing elements per layer, and the connectivity betweenprocessing elements). This is accomplished using a recently developedextension to the genetic algorithm which genetically breeds apopulation of LISP symbolic expressions (S-expressions) of varyingsize and shape until the desired performance by the network issuccessfully evolved. The new "genetic programming"paradigm is applied to the problem of generating a neural network forthe one-bit adder. 1.

Title: Adapting Bias by Gradient Descent: An Incremental Version of Delta-Bar-Delta
Abstract: Appropriate bias is widely viewed as the key toefficient learning and generalization. I present anew algorithm, the Incremental Delta-Bar-Delta(IDBD) algorithm, for the learning of appropriatebiases based on previous learning experience.The IDBD algorithm is developed for the caseof a simple, linear learning system---the LMS ordelta rule with a separate learning-rate parameterfor each input. The IDBD algorithm adjusts thelearning-rate parameters, which are an importantform of bias for this system. Because bias in thisapproach is adapted based on previous learningexperience, the appropriate testbeds are driftingor non-stationary learning tasks. For particulartasks of this type, I show that the IDBD algorithmperforms better than ordinary LMS and infact finds the optimal learning rates. The IDBDalgorithm extends and improves over prior workby Jacobs and by me in that it is fully incrementaland has only a single free parameter. Thispaper also extends previous work by pr...

Title: Motion regularization for model-based head tracking
Abstract: This paper describes a method for the robust tracking of rigid headmotion from video. This method uses a 3D ellipsoidal model of thehead and interprets the optical flow in terms of the possible rigidmotions of the model. This method is robust to large angular andtranslational motions of the head and is not subject to thesingularities of a 2D model. The method has been successfully appliedto heads with a variety of shapes, hair styles, etc. This method alsohas the advantage of accurately capturing the 3D motion parameters ofthe head. This accuracy is shown through comparison with a groundtruth synthetic sequence (a rendered 3D animation of a model head).In addition, the ellipsoidal model is robust to small variations inthe initial fit, enabling the automation of the model initialization.Lastly, due to its consideration of the entire 3D aspect of the head,the tracking is very stable over a large number of frames. Thisrobustness extends even to sequences with very low frame ...

Title: The representation and recognition of action using temporal templates
Abstract: A new view-based approach to the representationand recognition of action is presented. The basis ofthe representation is a temporal template --- a staticvector-image where the vector value at each point is afunction of the motion properties at the correspondingspatial location in an image sequence. Using 18 aerobicsexercises as a test domain, we explore the representationalpower of a simple, two component versionof the templates: the first value is a binary value indicatingthe presence of motion, and the second value isa function of the recency of motion in a sequence. Wethen develop a recognition method which matches thesetemporal templates against stored instances of viewsof known actions. The method automatically performstemporal segmentation, is invariant to linear changesin speed, and runs in real-time on a standard platform.We recently incorporated this technique into theKidsRoom: an interactive, narrative play-space forchildren.1 IntroductionThe recent shi...

Title: A generalized hidden Markov model for the recognition of human genes in DNA.
Abstract: We present a statistical model of genes in DNA.A Generalized Hidden Markov Model (GHMM)provides the framework for describing the grammarof a legal parse of a DNA sequence (Stormo& Haussler 1994). Probabilities are assigned totransitions between states in the GHMM and tothe generation of each nucleotide base given aparticular state. Machine learning techniques areapplied to optimize these probabilities using astandardized training set. Given a new candidatesequence, the best parse is deduced from themodel using a dynamic programming algorithmto identify the path through the model with maximumprobability. The GHMM is flexible andmodular, so new sensors and additional statescan be inserted easily. In addition, it providessimple solutions for integrating cardinality constraints,reading frame constraints, "indels", andhomology searching.The description and results of an implementationof such a gene-finding model, called Genie, is presented.The exon sensor is a codon fre...

We identify a set of lexicosyntacticpatterns that are easily recognizable, that occurfrequently and across text genre boundaries, andthat indisputably indicate the lexical relation of interest.We describe a method for discovering these patternsand suggest that other lexical relations will alsobe acquirable in this way.

The latterare also analyzed on periodical domains.

Feature space of any nature can be processed,and as an example, color image segmentation is discussed.The segmentation is completely autonomous,only its class is chosen by the user. Thus, the sameprogram can produce a high quality edge image, or provide,by extracting all the significant colors, a preprocessorfor content-based query systems.

Thisapproach has the advantagesof requiring no extra database access overhead for gatheringstatistics and of being ableto continuously adapt the value distribution through queries andupdates. Experimentalresults show that the estimation accuracy of this approach iscomparable to traditionalmethods based on statistics gathering.1 IntroductionIn most database systems, the task of query optimization is to choosean efficient executionplan.

One ofthe most important factors that affects plan cost is selectivity,which is the number of tuplessatisfying a given predicate.

The input MEIis matched against stored models which spanthe range of views of known actions.

Unlike similar systems which are limited to detectingupright, frontal faces, this system detects faces at any degree ofrotation in the image plane. The system employs multiple networks; a"router" network first processes each input window todetermine its orientation and then uses this information to preparethe window for one or more "detector" networks. We presentthe training methods for both types of networks. We also performsensitivity analysis on the networks, and present empirical resultson a large test set.

Abstract: We have been developing a theory for the generic representation of2-D shape, where structural descriptionsare derived from the shocks (singularities) of a curve evolutionprocess, acting on bounding contours.We now apply the theory to the problem of shape matching. The shocksare organized into a directed, acyclicshock graph, and complexity is managed by attending to the mostsignificant (central) shape components first. Thespace of all such graphs is highly structured and can becharacterized by the rules of a shock graph grammar. Thegrammar permits a reduction of a shock graph to a unique rooted shocktree. We introduce a novel tree matchingalgorithm which finds the best set of corresponding nodes between twoshock trees in polynomial time. Using adiverse database of shapes, we demonstrate our system's performanceunder articulation, occlusion, and moderatechanges in viewpoint.

Prediction risk estimation and modelselection areespecially important for problems with limited data. Techniques forestimating predictionrisk include data resampling algorithms such as nonlinearcross--validation(NCV) and algebraic formulae such as the predicted squared error(PSE) and generalizedprediction error (GPE). We show that exhaustive search over the spaceof network architectures is computationally infeasible even fornetworks of modestsize. This motivates the use of heuristic strategies thatdramatically reduce the searchcomplexity. These strategies employ directed search algorithms, suchas selectingthe number of nodes...

In this paper, we show that feedforward neuralnetworks can have ill-conditionedHessians and that this ill-conditioning can be quite common. Theanalysis and experimental resultsin this paper lead to the conclusion that many network trainingproblems are ill-conditioned andmay not be solved more efficiently by higher-order optimizationmethods.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks that are trained to behave likedeterministic finite-state automata (DFAs)can show deteriorating performance when tested on long strings. Thisdeteriorating performance canbe attributed to the instability of the internal representation ofthe learned DFA states. The use ofa sigmoidal discriminant function together with the recurrentstructure contribute to this instability.We prove that a simple algorithm can construct second-order recurrentneural networks with a sparseinterconnection topology and sigmoidal discriminant function suchthat the internal DFA state representationsare stable, i.e. the constructed network correctly classifies stringsof arbitrary length. Thealgorithm is based on encoding strengths of weights directly into theneural network. We derive a relationshipbetween the weight strength and the number of DFA states for robuststring classification.

Abstract: This paper presents Random Early Detection (RED) gateways forcongestion avoidance in packetswitchednetworks. The gateway detects incipient congestion by computing theaverage queue size. Thegateway could notify connections of congestion either by droppingpackets arriving at the gateway orby setting a bit in packet headers. When the average queue sizeexceeds a preset threshold, the gatewaydrops or marks each arriving packet with a certain probability, wherethe exact probability is a functionof the average queue size.RED gateways keep the average queue size low while allowingoccasional bursts of packets in thequeue. During congestion, the probability that the gateway notifies aparticular connection to reduceits window is roughly proportional to that connection's share of thebandwidth through the gateway.RED gateways are designed to accompany a transport-layer congestioncontrol protocol such as TCP.The RED gateway has no bias against bursty traffic and avoids theglobal ...

Title: Modeling TCP Throughput: A Simple Model and its Empirical Validation
Abstract: In this paper we develop a simple analytic characterizationof the steady state throughput, as a function of loss rateand round trip time for a bulk transfer TCP flow, i.e., aflow with an unlimited amount of data to send. Unlike themodels in [6, 7, 10], our model captures not only the behaviorof TCP's fast retransmit mechanism (which is alsoconsidered in [6, 7, 10]) but also the effect of TCP's timeoutmechanism on throughput. Our measurements suggest thatthis latter behavior is important from a modeling perspective,as almost all of our TCP traces contained more timeoutevents than fast retransmit events. Our measurementsdemonstrate that our model is able to more accurately predictTCP throughput and is accurate over a wider range ofloss rates.1 IntroductionA significant amount of today's Internet traffic, includingWWW (HTTP), file transfer (FTP), email (SMTP), and remoteaccess (Telnet) traffic, is carried by the TCP transportprotocol [18].

Title: A Survey of Active Network Research
Abstract: Active networks are a novel approach to network architecture in whichthe switches of the network perform customized computations on themessages flowing through them. This approach is motivated by bothlead user applications, which perform user-driven computation atnodes within the network today, and the emergence of mobile codetechnologies that make dynamic network service innovation attainable.In this paper, we discuss two approaches to the realization of activenetworks and provide a snapshot of the current research issues andactivities. Introduction -- What Are Active Networks? In an activenetwork, the routers or switches of the network perform customizedcomputations on the messages flowing through them. For example, auser of an active network could send a "trace" program toeach router and arrange for the program to be executed when theirpackets are processed. Figure 1 illustrates how the routers of an IPnetwork could be augmented to perform such customized processing ...

Title: Link-sharing and resource management models for packet networks
Abstract: This paper discusses the use of link-sharing mechanisms in packetnetworks and presents algorithms for hierarchical link-sharing.Hierarchical link-sharing allows multiple agencies, protocolfamilies, or traffic types to share the bandwidth on a link in acontrolled fashion. Link-sharing and real-time services both requireresource management mechanisms at the gateway. Rather than requiringa gateway to implement separate mechanisms for link-sharing andrealtime services, the approach in this paper is to view linksharingand real-time service requirements as simultaneous, and in somerespect complementary, constraints at a gateway that can beimplemented with a unified set of mechanisms. While it is notpossible to completely predict the requirements that might evolve inthe Internet over the next decade, we argue that controlledlink-sharing is an essential component that can provide gateways withthe flexibility to accommodate emerging applications and networkprotocols. 1 Introduct...

Title: Promoting the use of end-to-end congestion control in the Internet
Abstract: This paper considers the potentially negative impacts of anincreasingdeployment of non-congestion-controlled best-efforttraffic on the Internet.1These negative impacts range fromextreme unfairness against competing TCP traffic to the potentialfor congestion collapse. To promote the inclusion ofend-to-end congestion control for best-effort traffic, we arguethat router mechanisms are needed to identify and restrict thebandwidth of selected high-bandwidth best-effort flows thatare using a disproportionate share of the bandwidth in timesof congestion.Starting with high-bandwidth flows in times of congestion,we describe a sequence of tests identifying those highbandwidthflows suitable for bandwidth regulation. These testsidentify a high-bandwidth flow in times of congestion asunresponsive,"not TCP-friendly", or simply using disproportionatebandwidth. An unresponsive flow is one failing to reduceits offered load at a router in response to an increased packetdrop rate. ...

Title: Dynamic Source Routing in Ad Hoc Wireless Networks
Abstract: An ad hoc network is a collection of wireless mobile hosts forming atemporary network without theaid of any established infrastructure or centralized administration.In such an environment, it may benecessary for one mobile host to enlist the aid of other hosts inforwarding a packet to its destination,due to the limited range of each mobile host's wirelesstransmissions. This paper presents a protocolfor routing in ad hoc networks that uses dynamic source routing. Theprotocol adapts quickly to routingchanges when host movement is frequent, yet requires little or nooverhead during periods in whichhosts move less frequently. Based on results from a packet-levelsimulation of mobile hosts operating inan ad hoc network, the protocol performs well over a variety ofenvironmental conditions such as hostdensity and movement rates. For all but the highest rates of hostmovement simulated, the overhead ofthe protocol is quite low, falling to just 1% of total data packetstransmitte...

We aim to describe all these aspects of mobilitywithin a single frameworkthat encompasses mobile agents, the ambients where agents interactand the mobility ofthe ambients themselves.The inspiration for this work comes from the potential for mobilecomputationover the World-Wide Web. The geographic distribution of the Webnaturally calls formobility of computation, as a way of flexibly managing latency andbandwidth.

The key feature is the dependence on ancillary machines totrack the location of themobile hosts.

Abstract: An ad-hoc network is the cooperative engagement of a collection ofmobile nodes without the required intervention of any centralizedaccess point or existing infrastructure. In this paper we presentAd-hoc On Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV), a novel algorithmfor the operation of such ad-hoc networks. Each Mobile Host operatesas a specialized router, and routes are obtained as needed (i.e.,on-demand) with little or no reliance on periodic advertisements. Ournew routing algorithm is quite suitable for a dynamic selfstartingnetwork, as required by users wishing to utilize ad-hoc networks.AODV provides loop-free routes even while repairing broken links.Because the protocol does not require global periodic routingadvertisements, the demand on the overall bandwidth available to themobile nodes is substantially less than in those protocols that donecessitate such advertisements. Nevertheless we can still maintainmost of the advantages of basic distance-vector routing mechanis...

Title: Towards an Active Network Architecture
Abstract: Active networks allow their users to inject customized programs intothe nodes of the network. An extreme case, in which we are mostinterested, replaces packets with "capsules" -- programfragments that are executed at each network router/switch theytraverse. Active architectures permit a massive increase in thesophistication of the computation that is performed within thenetwork. They will enable new applications, especially those based onapplication-specific multicast, information fusion, and otherservices that leverage network-based computation and storage.Furthermore, they will accelerate the pace of innovation bydecoupling network services from the underlying hardware and allowingnew services to be loaded into the infrastructure on demand. In thispaper, we describe our vision of an active network architecture,outline our approach to its design, and survey the technologies thatcan be brought to bear on its implementation.

Title: The design philosophy of the DARPA internet protocols
Abstract: The Internet protocol suite, TCP/IP, was first proposed fifteen yearsago. It was developed by the Defense Advanced Research ProjectsAgency (DARPA), and has been used widely in military and commercialsystems. While there have been papers and specifications thatdescribe how the protocols work, it is sometimes difficult to deducefrom these why the protocol is as it is. For example, the Internetprotocol is based on a connectionless or datagram mode of service.The motivation for this has been greatly misunderstood. This paperattempts to capture some of the early reasoning which shaped theInternet protocols. 1.

Title: Summary cache: a scalable wide-area Web cache sharing protocol
Abstract: The sharing of caches among Web proxies is an importanttechnique to reduce Web traffic and alleviatenetwork bottlenecks. Nevertheless it is not widelydeployed due to the overhead of existing protocols.In this paper we demonstrate the benefits of cachesharing, measure the overhead of the existing protocols,and propose a new protocol called "SummaryCache". In this new protocol, each proxy keeps asummary of the cache directory of each participatingproxy, and checks these summaries for potential hitsbefore sending any queries. Two factors contributeto our protocol's low overhead: the summaries areupdated only periodically, and the directory representationsare very economical, as low as 8 bits perentry. Using trace-driven simulations and a prototypeimplementation, we show that, compared to existingprotocols such as the Internet Cache Protocol (ICP),Summary Cache reduces the number of inter-cacheprotocol messages by a factor of 25 to 60, reducesthe bandwidth consumption by...

Abstract: Recent traffic measurement studies from a widerange of working packet networks have convincingly establishedthe presence of significant statistical features that arecharacteristic of fractal traffic processes, in the sense thatthese features span many time scales. Of particular interestin packet traffic modeling is a property called long-rangedependence, which is marked by the presence of correlationsthat can extend over many time scales. In this paper, wedemonstrate empirically that, beyond its statistical significancein traffic measurements, long-range dependence hasconsiderable impact on queueing performance, and is a dominantcharacteristic for a number of packet traffic engineeringproblems. In addition, we give conditions under whichthe use of compact and simple traffic models that incorporatelong-range dependence in a parsimonious manner (e.g.,fractional Brownian motion) is justified and can lead to new insightsinto the traffic management of high-speed networks.1...

Title: The PIM architecture for wide-area multicast routing
Abstract: The purpose of multicast routing is to reduce the communicationcosts for applications that send the same data tomultiple recipients. Existing multicast routing mechanismswere intended for use within regions where a group is widelyrepresented or bandwidth is universally plentiful. Whengroup members, and senders to those group members, aredistributed sparsely across a wide area, these schemes arenot efficient; data packets or membership report informationare occasionally sent over many links that do not leadto receivers or senders, respectively. We have developeda multicast routing architecture that efficiently establishesdistribution trees across wide area internets, where manygroups will be sparsely represented. Efficiency is measuredin terms of the router state, control message processing,and data packet processing, required across the entire networkin order to deliver data packets to the members ofthe group.Our Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) architecture:a) ma...

Abstract: The bandwidth demands of the World Wide Web continue to grow at ahyper-exponential rate. Giventhis rocketing growth, caching of web objects as a means to reducenetwork bandwidth consumption islikely to be a necessity in the very near future. Unfortunately, manyWeb caches do not satisfactorilymaintain cache consistency. This paper presents a survey ofcontemporary cache consistencymechanisms in use on the Internet today and examines recent researchin Web cache consistency. Usingtrace-driven simulation, we show that a weak cache consistencyprotocol (the one used in the Alex ftpcache) reduces network bandwidth consumption and server load morethan either time-to-live fields oran invalidation protocol and can be tuned to return stale data lessthan 5% of the time.1.0 IntroductionNetwork traffic continues to grow at a hyper-exponential rate whilenetwork infrastructure does not.This means that existing networks are plagued by ever increasingutilization demands.

Title: RCBR: a simple and efficient service for multiple time-scale traffic
Abstract: Variable bit rate compressed video traffic is expected to be asignificant component of the traffic mix in integrated servicesnetworks. This traffic is hard to manage because it has strict delayand loss requirements while simultaneously exhibiting burstiness atmultiple time-scales. We show that burstiness over long time-scales,in conjunction with resource reservation using one-shot trafficdescriptors, can substantially degrade the loss rate, end-to-enddelay and statistical multiplexing gain of a connection. We uselarge-deviation theory to model the performance of multipletime-scale traffic and to motivate the design of RenegotiatedConstant Bit Rate (RCBR) Service. Sources using RCBR service arepresented with an abstraction of a fixed-size buffer which is drainedat a constant rate. They may renegotiate the drain rate to matchtheir workload. Because all traffic entering the network is CBR, RCBRrequires minimal buffering and scheduling support in switches. Weshow that the service is...

Title: Improving the Performance of Reliable Transport Protocols in Mobile Computing Environments
Abstract: We explore the performance of reliable data communication in mobilecomputing environments. Motion across wireless cell boundaries causesincreased delays and packet losses while the network learns how toroute data to a host's new location. Reliable transport protocolslike TCP interpret these delays and losses as signs of networkcongestion. They consequently throttle their transmissions, furtherdegrading performance. We quantify this degradation throughmeasurements of protocol behavior in a wireless networking testbed.We show how current TCP implementations introduce unacceptably longpauses in communication during cellular handoffs (800 millisecondsand longer), and propose an end-to-end fast retransmission schemethat can reduce these pauses to levels more suitable for humaninteraction (200 milliseconds). Our work makes clear the need forreliable transport protocols to differentiate between motion-relatedand congestion-related packet losses, and suggests how to adapt thesep...

Abstract: In this paper we investigate how FEC (Forward Error Correction) canbe combined with ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request) to achieve scalablereliable multicast transmission. We consider the two scenarios whereFEC is introduced as a transparent layer underneath a reliablemulticast layer that uses ARQ, and where FEC and ARQ are bothintegrated into a single layer that uses the retransmission of paritydata to recover from the loss of original data packets. To evaluatethe performance improvements due to FEC, we consider different typesof loss behaviors (spatially or temporally correlated loss,homogeneous or heterogeneous loss) and loss rates for up to 10 6receivers. Our results show that introducing FEC as a layer below ARQcan improve multicast transmission efficiency and scalability andthat there are substantial additional improvements when the two areintegrated. 1 Introduction The deployment of the MBONE mademulti-point communication across the Internet feasible and fosteredthe...

Inparticular, we study the synchronization of periodic routingmessages, and offer guidelineson how to avoid inadvertent synchronization. Using simulations andanalysis, we study theprocess of synchronization and show that the transition fromunsynchronized to synchronizedtraffic is not one of gradual degradation but is instead a veryabrupt `phase transition': ingeneral, the addition of a single router will convert a completelyunsynchronized traffic streaminto a completely synchronized one. We show that synchronization canbe avoided by theaddition of randomization to the traffic sources and quantify howmuch randomization isnecessary. In addition, we argue that the inadvertent synchronizationof periodic processes islikely to become an increasing problem in computer networks.

Clientsdon't lose any functionality by going through a proxy, except specialprocessing they may have done for nonnative Web protocols such asGopher and FTP.

Abstract: TCP is a reliable transport protocol tuned to perform well intraditional networks where congestion is the primarycause of packet loss. However, networks with wireless links andmobile hosts incur significant losses due to biterrorsand handoff. This environment violates many of the assumptions madeby TCP, causing degraded end-toendperformance. In this paper, we describe the additions andmodifications to the standard Internet protocol stack(TCP/IP) to improve end-to-end reliable transport performance inmobile environments. The protocol changes aremade to network-layer software at the base station and mobile host,and preserve the end-to-end semantics of TCP.One part of the modifications, called the snoop module, cachespackets at the base station and performs localretransmissions across the wireless link to alleviate the problemscaused by high bit-error rates.

Abstract: Networked sensors -- those that coordinate amongst themselves toachieve a larger sensing task -- will revolutionize informationgathering and processing both in urban environments and ininhospitable terrain. The sheer numbers of these sensors and theexpected dynamics in these environments present unique challenges inthe design of unattended autonomous sensor networks. These challengeslead us to hypothesize that sensor network coordination applicationsmay need to be structured differently from traditional networkapplications. In particular, we believe that localized algorithms (inwhich simple local node behavior achieves a desired global objective)may be necessary for sensor network coordination. In this paper, wedescribe localized algorithms, and then discuss directed diffusion, asimple communication model for describing localized algorithms.

Title: Eliminating Receive Livelock in an Interrupt-Driven Kernel
Abstract: Most operating systems use interface interrupts to schedule networktasks.Interrupt-driven systems can provide low overhead and good latency atlow offeredload, but degrade significantly at higher arrival rates unless careis taken toprevent several pathologies. These are various forms of receivelivelock, in whichthe system spends all its time processing interrupts, to theexclusion of othernecessary tasks. Under extreme conditions, no packets are deliveredto the userapplication or the output of the system.To avoid livelock and related problems, an operating system mustschedule networkinterrupt handling as carefully as it schedules process execution. Wemodified an interrupt-driven networking implementation to do so; thiseliminatesreceive livelock without degrading other aspects of systemperformance.

Title: Throughput-Competitive On-Line Routing
Abstract: We develop a framework that allows us to address the issues ofadmission control and routing in high-speed networks under therestriction that once a call is admitted and routed, it has toproceed to completion and no reroutings are allowed. The "norerouting" restriction appears in all the proposals for futurehigh-speed networks and stems from current hardware limitations, inparticular the fact that the bandwidth-delay product of the newlydeveloped optical communication links far exceeds the buffer capacityof the network. In case the goal is to maximize the throughput, ourframework yields an on-line O(lognT )-competitive strategy, where nis the number of nodes in the network and T is the maximum callduration. In other words, our strategy results in throughput that iswithin O(log nT ) factor of the highest possible throughputachievable by an omniscient algorithm that knows all of the requestsin advance. Moreover, we show that no on-line strategy can achieve abetter competit...

Title: Secure Group Communications Using Key Graphs
Abstract: Many emerging applications (e.g., teleconference, real-timeinformation services, pay per view, distributed interactivesimulation, and collaborative work) are based upon a groupcommunications model, i.e., they require packet delivery from one ormore authorized senders to a very large number of authorizedreceivers. As a result, securing group communications (i.e.,providing confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of messagesdelivered between group members) will become a critical networkingissue. In this paper, we present a novel solution to the scalabilityproblem of group/multicast key management. We formalize the notion ofa secure group as a triple (U; K;R) where U denotes a set of users, Ka set of keys held by the users, and R a user-key relation. We thenintroduce key graphs to specify secure groups. For a special class ofkey graphs, we present three strategies for securely distributingrekey messages after a join/leave, and specify protocols for joiningand leaving a...

Title: PLAN: A Packet Language for Active Networks
Abstract: PLAN (Packet Language for Active Networks) is a new language forprograms that form the packets of a programmable network. Theseprograms replace the packet headers (which can be viewed as veryrudimentary programs) used in current networks. As such, PLANprograms are lightweight and of restricted functionality. Theselimitations are mitigated by allowing PLAN code to call node-residentservice routines written in other, more powerful languages. Thistwo-level architecture, in which PLAN serves as a scripting or `glue'language for more general services, is the primary contribution ofthis paper. We have successfully applied the PLAN programmingenvironment to implement an IP-free internetwork. PLAN is based onthe simply typed lambda calculus and provides a restricted set ofprimitives and datatypes. PLAN defines a special construct called achunk used to describe the remote execution of PLAN programs on othernodes. Primitive operations on chunks are used to provide basic datatransp...

Title: Data Networks as Cascades: Investigating the Multifractal Nature of Internet WAN Traffic
Abstract: In apparent contrast to the well-documented self-similar (i.e.,monofractal) scaling behavior of measured LAN traffic, recentstudies have suggested that measured TCP/IP andATM WAN traffic exhibits more complex scaling behavior,consistent with multifractals. To bring multifractals intothe realm of networking, this paper provides a simple constructionbased on cascades (also known as multiplicativeprocesses) that is motivated by the protocol hierarchy of IPdata networks. The cascade framework allows for a plausiblephysical explanation of the observed multifractal scalingbehavior of data traffic and suggests that the underlyingmultiplicative structure is a traffic invariant for WAN trafficthat co-exists with self-similarity. In particular, cascades allowus to refine the previously observed self-similar nature ofdata traffic to account for local irregularities in WAN trafficthat are typically associated with networking mechanismsoperating on small time scales, such as TCP fl...

Title: Scalable High Speed IP Routing Lookups
Abstract: Internet address lookup is a challenging problem because ofincreasing routing table sizes, increased traffic, higher speedlinks, and the migration to 128 bit IPv6 addresses. IP routing lookuprequires computing the best matching prefix, for which standardsolutions like hashing were believed to be inapplicable. The bestexisting solution we know of, BSD radix tries, scales badly as IPmoves to 128 bit addresses. Our paper describes a new algorithm forbest matching prefix using binary search on hash tables organized byprefix lengths. Our scheme scales very well as address and routingtable sizes increase: independent of the table size, it requires aworst case time of log_2 (address bits) hash lookups. Thus only 5hash lookups are needed for IPv4 and 7 for IPv6. We also introduceMutating Binary Search and other optimizations that, for a typicalIPv4 backbone router with over 33,000 entries, considerably reducethe average number of hashes to less than 2, of which one hash can besimplified to an indexed array access. We expect similar average casebehavior for IPv6.

Title: Balancing push and pull for data broadcast
Abstract: The increasing ability to interconnect computers throughinternetworking, wireless networks, high-bandwidth satellite, andcable networks has spawned a new class of information-centeredapplications based on data dissemination. These applications employbroadcast to deliver data to very large client populations. We haveproposed the Broadcast Disks paradigm [Zdon94, Acha95b] fororganizing the contents of a data broadcast program and for managingclient resources in response to such a program. Our previous work onBroadcast Disks focused exclusively on the "push-based"approach, where data is sent out on the broadcast channel accordingto a periodic schedule, in anticipation of client requests. In thispaper, we study how to augment the push-only model with a"pull-based" approach of using a backchannel to allowclients to send explicit requests for data to the server. We analyzethe scalability and performance of a broadcast-based system thatintegrates push and pull and study the imp...

Abstract: Ad hoc networks are characterized by multi-hop wireless connectivity,frequently changing network topology and the need for efficientdynamic routing protocols. We compare the performance of twoprominent on-demand routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks --Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance VectorRouting (AODV). A detailed simulation model with MAC and physicallayer models is used to study inter-layer interactions and theirperformance implications. We demonstrate that even though DSR andAODV share a similar on-demand behavior, the differences in theprotocol mechanics can lead to significant performance differentials.The performance differentials are analyzed using varying networkload, mobility and network size. Based on the observations, we makerecommendations about how the performance of either protocol can beimproved.

Title: A Novel Server Selection Technique for Improving the Response Time of a Replicated Service
Abstract: Server replication is an approach often used to improvethe ability of a service to handle a large number ofclients. One of the important factors in the efficient utilizationof replicated servers is the ability to direct clientrequests to the best server, according to some optimalitycriteria. In this paper we target an environment inwhich servers are distributed across the Internet, andclients identify servers using our application-layer anycastingservice. Our goal is to allocate servers to clientsin a way that minimizes a client's response time. To thatend, we develop an approach for estimating the performancethat a client would experience when accessing particularservers. Such information is maintained in a resolverthat clients can query to obtain the identity of theserver with the best response time. Our performance collectiontechnique combines server push with client probesto estimate the expected response time. A set of experimentsis used to demonstrate the propert...

In addition to beingindependent from network-layer support, our definitionincludes the notion of filters, functions that areapplied to groups of addresses to affect the selectionprocess. We consider both metric-based filters (e.g.,server response time) and policy-based filters.

Title: A Mobile Networking System Based on Internet Protocol
Abstract: Due to advances in wireless communication technology there is agrowing demand for providing continuous network access to the usersof portable computers, regardless of their location. Existing networkprotocols cannot meet this requirement since they were designed withthe assumption of a static network topology where hosts do not changetheir location over time. We have developed a model which fitsnaturally into the usual framework for routing over Internet Protocol(IP) networks. Then, based on IP's Loose Source Route option, we havedeveloped a scheme for implementing agents conforming to this modeland providing transparent network access to mobile hosts. Our schemeis easy to implement, requires no changes to the existing set ofhosts and routers, and achieves optimal routing in many cases. Anoutline of the proposed scheme is presented and a referenceimplementation is described. 1 Introduction In the last two years, wehave witnessed two major changes in computer technology. ...

Title: A Reliable Multicast data Distribution Protocol based on software FEC techniques
Abstract: January 15, 1997 Abstract Applications requiring the reliabledistribution of data to groups of clients would be supportedperfectly by reliable multicast protocols. In many cases, the problemof congestion control (a major research issue otherwise) does notexist because downlink bandwidth is "owned" or can bepreallocated to a particular server by independent means, but theproblems of insuring reliable data delivery to large groups, andadaptability to heterogeneous clients, still remain. These problemscan be solved at once with the clever use of FEC techniques. In thispaper we show the design of a Reliable Multicast data DistributionProtocol (RMDP) that we have built using these techniques, anddiscuss the implementation tradeoffs. Experimental results show that,albeit somewhat expensive, doing encoding/decoding in software isaffordable for speeds up to the MB/s range even on desktop PCs.Slower machines can still receive at high speed, thus optimizingnetwork usag...

Abstract: High-performance execution in distributed computing environmentsoften requires careful selection and configuration not only ofcomputers, networks, and other resources but also of the protocolsand algorithms used by applications. Selection and configuration inturn require access to accurate, up-to-date information on thestructure and state of available resources. Unfortunately, nostandard mechanism exists for organizing or accessing suchinformation. Consequently, different tools and applications adoptadhoc mechanisms, or they compromise their portability and performanceby using default configurations. We propose a Metacomputing DirectoryService that provides efficient and scalable access to diverse,dynamic, and distributed information about resource structure andstate.

Title: The Effects of Asymmetry on TCP Performance
Abstract: In this paper, we study the effects of network asymmetry on endto-end TCP performance and suggest techniques to improve it. Thenetworks investigated in this study include a wireless cable modemnetwork and a packet radio network. In recent literature (e.g.,[16]), asymmetry has been considered in terms of a mismatch inbandwidths in the two directions of a data transfer. We generalizethis notion of bandwidth asymmetry to other aspects of asymmetry,such as latency and media-access, and packet error rate, which arecommon in wide-area wireless networks. Using a combination ofexperiments on real networks and simulation, we analyze TCPperformance in such networks where the throughput achieved is notsolely a function of the link and traffic characteristics in thedirection of data transfer (the forward direction) , but dependssignificantly on the reverse direction as well. We focus on bandwidthand latency asymmetries, and propose and evaluate several schemes toimprove end-to-end p...

Title: File Server Scaling with Network-Attached Secure Disks
Abstract: By providing direct data transfer between storage and client, network-attached storage devices have the potential to improve scalabilityfor existing distributed file systems (by removing the serveras a bottleneck) and bandwidth for new parallel and distributed filesystems (through network striping and more efficient data paths).Together, these advantages influence a large enough fraction of thestorage market to make commodity network-attached storage feasible.Realizing the technology's full potential requires carefulconsideration across a wide range of file system, networking andsecurity issues.

Title: The Effects of Mobility on Reliable Transport Protocols
Abstract: We explore the effects of host motion on the performance of activetransport-level connections. Motion causes increased delays andpacket losses while the network learns how to route data to a host'snew location. Reliable transport protocols interpret these delays andlosses as signs of network congestion. They consequently throttletheir transmissions, further degrading performance. We quantify thisdegradation through measurements of protocol behavior in a wirelessnetworking testbed. We show how current retransmission policiesintroduce unacceptably long pauses in communication (800 millisecondsand longer), and propose an end-to-end fast retransmission schemethat can reduce these pauses to levels more suitable for humaninteraction (200 milliseconds). Our work demonstrates that reliabletransport protocols must be made aware of mobility, and suggests howto adapt these protocols to mobile computing environments. 1Introduction Reliable transport protocols have been tuned for ne...

Abstract: Networking protocols are being modified to handle mobility of hosts.This paper argues that there is a need to make mobility explicit atevery level of the OSI model --- even above the network level throughuser or application level. Further, it is proposed that the mobilehost and the first hop (wireless link) of communication be handleddifferently than the rest of the network. Hence, in networks withmobile hosts, we propose a radical approach of indirect interactionbetween clients and servers. 1 Introduction The client-serverparadigm has served well for structuring applications in distributedsystems. The paradigm is implicitly based on two assumptions: 1) theend points of the communication link are fixed and 2) the underlyingnetwork infrastructure is to a large extent homogeneous (highbandwidth, reliable, and low latency). However, mobile hosts havedifferent characteristics from fixed hosts. Mobility implies thathosts will connect from different access points and ma...

We have designedprotocol enhancements for IPv6, known as Mobile IPv6,that allow transparent routing of IPv6 packets to mobilenodes, taking advantage of the opportunities madepossible by the design of a new version of IP. In MobileIPv6, each mobile node is always identified by itshome address, regardless of its current point of attachmentto the Internet. While away from its home IPsubnet, a mobile node is also associated with a careofaddress, which indicates the mobile node's currentlocation. Mobile IPv6 enables any IPv6 node to learnand cache the care-of address associated with a mobilenode's home address, and then to send packets destinedfor the mobile node directly to it at this care-of addressusing an IPv6 Routing header.David Johnson was supported in part by the National ScienceFoundation under CAREER Award NCR-9502725, by th...

Title: Packet Fair Queueing Algorithms for Wireless Networks with Location-Dependent Errors
Abstract: While Packet Fair Queueing (PFQ) algorithms provide both boundeddelay and fairness in wired networks, they cannot be applied directlyto wireless networks. The key difficulty is that in wireless networkssessions can experience location-dependent channel errors. This maylead to situations in which a session receives significantly lessservice than it is supposed to, while another receives more. Thisresults in large discrepancies between the sessions' virtual times,making it difficult to provide both delay-guarantees and fairnesssimultaneously. Our contribution is twofold. First, we identify a setof properties, called Channel-condition Independent Fair (CIF), thata Packet Fair Queueing algorithm should have in a wirelessenvironment: (1) delay and throughput guarantees for error-freesessions, (2) long term fairness for error sessions, (3) short termfairness for error-free sessions, and (4) graceful degradation forsessions that have received excess service.

Abstract: GLS is a new distributed location service which tracks mobile nodelocations. GLS combined with geographic forwarding allows theconstruction of ad hoc mobile networks that scale to a larger numberof nodes than possible with previous work. GLS is decentralized andruns on the mobile nodes themselves, requiring no fixedinfrastructure. Each mobile node periodically updates a small set ofother nodes (its location servers) with its current location. A nodesends its position updates to its location servers without knowingtheir actual identities, assisted by a predefined ordering of nodeidentifiers and a predefined geographic hierarchy. Queries for amobile node's location also use the predefined identifier orderingand spatial hierarchy to find a location server for that node.Experiments using the ns simulator for up to 600 mobile nodes showthat the storage and bandwidth requirements of GLS grow slowly withthe size of the network. Furthermore, GLS tolerates node failureswell: eac...

GPSR makes greedy forwarding decisions usingonly information about a router's immediate neighbors in thenetwork topology. When a packet reaches a region where greedyforwarding is impossible, the algorithm recovers by routing aroundthe perimeter of the region. By keeping state only about the localtopology, GPSR scales better in per-router state than shortest-pathand ad-hoc routing protocols as the number of network destinationsincreases. Under mobility's frequent topology changes, GPSR canuse local topology information to find correct new routes quickly.We describe the GPSR protocol, and use extensive simulation ofmobile wireless networks to compare its performance with that ofDynamic Source Routing.

Thisnetwork architecture has three main advantages. First, it providesspatial reuse of the bandwidth due to node clustering. Secondly,bandwidth can be shared or reserved in a controlled fashion in eachcluster. Finally, the cluster algorithm is robust in the face oftopological changes caused by node motion, node failure and nodeinsertion /removal.

Abstract: For some time, the networking community has assumedthat it is impossible to do IP routing lookups in softwarefast enough to support gigabit speeds. IP routinglookups must find the routing entry with the longestmatching prefix, a task that has been thought to requirehardware support at lookup frequencies of millions persecond.We present a forwarding table data structure designedfor quick routing lookups. Forwarding tables aresmall enough to fit in the cache of a conventional generalpurpose processor. With the table in cache, a 200 MHzPentium Pro or a 333 MHz Alpha 21164 can perform afew million lookups per second. This means that it isfeasible to do a full routing lookup for each IP packetat gigabit speeds without special hardware.The forwarding tables are very small, a large routingtable with 40,000 routing entries can be compacted to aforwarding table of 150--160 Kbytes.

Abstract: Many future applications will require guarantees on networkperformance, such as bounds onthroughput, delay, delay jitter, and reliability. To address thisneed, the Tenet Group at the Universityof California at Berkeley has designed, simulated, and implemented asuite of network protocolsto support real-time channels (network connections withmathematically provableperformance guarantees). The protocols, which constitute theprototype Tenet Real-Time ProtocolSuite (Suite 1), run on a packet-switching internetwork, and cancoexist with the popular InternetSuite. We rely on the use of connection-oriented communication,admission control, and channelrate control.This protocol suite is the first complete set of communicationprotocols that can transfer real-timestreams with guaranteed quality in packet-switching internetworks.Our initial development wasdone on a local-area FDDI network. We have since installed ourprotocols on the experimentalwide-area internetwork of Project ...

Title: Dynamics of IP Traffic: A Study of the Role of Variability and the Impact of Control
Abstract: Using the ns-2-simulator to experiment with different aspects ofuser- or session-behaviors and network configurations and focusingon the qualitative aspects of a wavelet-based scaling analysis,we present a systematic investigation into how and why variabilityand feedback-control contribute to the intriguing scaling propertiesobserved in actual Internet traces (as our benchmark data, weuse measured Internet traffic from an ISP). We illustrate howvariabilityof both user aspects and network environments (i) causesself-similar scaling behavior over large time scales, (ii) determinesa more or less pronounced change in scaling behavior around aspecific time scale, and (iii) sets the stage for the emergence ofsurprisinglyrich scaling dynamics over small time scales; i.e., multifractalscaling. Moreover, our scaling analyses indicate whether ornot open-loop controls such as UDP or closed-loop controls suchas TCP impact the local or small-scale behavior of the traffic andhow the...

Title: The ACTIVE IP Option
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss our work on an active network architecturein which passive packets are replacedwith active capsules --- encapsulated program fragments that areexecuted at each switch they traverse. Thisapproach allows application-specific processing to be injected intothe network. The accessibility of computationand storage "within" the network provides a substrate thatcan be tailored to build global applications,including those that invoke customized multicast and mergeprocessing.We describe an extension to the IP options mechanism that supportsthe embedding of program fragments indatagrams and the evaluation of these fragments as they traverse theInternet. The active option providesa generic approach to the extension of the IP network service.1 Active NetworksTraditional data networks passively transport bits from one endsystem to another. Ideally, the user datais transferred opaquely, with the role of computation within suchnetworks being extremely limi...

Title: The Tiger Video Fileserver
Abstract: Tiger is a distributed, fault-tolerant real-time fileserver. Itprovides data streams at a constant, guaranteed rate to alarge number of clients, in addition to supporting moretraditional filesystem operations. It is intended to be thebasis for multimedia (video on demand) fileservers, butmay also be used in other applications needing constantrate data delivery. The fundamental problem addressed bythe Tiger design is that of efficiently balancing user loadagainst limited disk, network and I/O bus resources. Tigeraccomplishes this balancing by striping file data across alldisks and all computers in the (distributed) system, andthen allocating data streams in a schedule that rotatesacross the disks. This paper describes the Tiger designand an implementation that runs on a collection ofpersonal computers connected by an ATM switch.1.

Title: PLAN: A Programming Language for Active Networks
Abstract: PLAN (Programming Language for Active Networks) is a new language forprograms that are carried in the packets of a programmable network.PLAN programs replace the packet headers (which can be viewed as`dumb' programs) used in current networks. As a header replacement,PLAN programs must be lightweight and of limited functionality. Theselimitations are mitigated by allowing PLAN code to call serviceroutines written in other, more powerful languages. These serviceroutines may also be loaded into the routers dynamically. Thistwo-level architecture, in which PLAN serves as a scripting or `glue'language for more general services, is the primary contribution ofthe paper. PLAN is a strict functional language providing a limitedset of primitives and datatypes. PLAN defines primitives for remotelyexecuting PLAN programs on other nodes, and these primitives are usedto provide basic data transport in the network. Because remoteexecution makes debugging difficult, PLAN provides strong ...

Title: IP switching --- ATM under IP
Abstract: IP traffic on the Internet and private enterprise networks has beengrowing exponentially for some time. This growth is beginning tostress the traditional, processor based design of current dayrouters. Switching technology offers much higher aggregate bandwidthbut presently only offers a layer-2 bridging solution. Variousproposals are under way to support IP routing over an ATM network.However, these proposals hide the real network topology from the IPlayer by treating the datalink layer as a large, opaque, networkcloud. We argue that this leads to complexity, inefficiency andduplication of functionality in the resulting network. We propose analternative in which we discard the end-to-end ATM connection andintegrate fast ATM hardware directly with IP, preserving theconnectionless nature of IP. We use soft-state in the ATM hardware tocache the IP forwarding decision. This enables further traffic on thesame IP flow to be switched by the ATM hardware rather than forwardedby ...

Abstract: A number of proposals for supporting IP over ATMare under discussion in the networking communityincluding: LAN emulation, classical IP over ATM, routingover large clouds, and multiprotocol over ATM. Each ofthese proposals hides the real network topology from theIP layer by treating the data link layer as a large, opaque,network cloud. We argue that this leads to complexity,inefficiency and duplication of functionality in theresulting network.We propose an alternative in which we discard theconnection oriented nature of ATM and integrate fastATM hardware directly with IP, preserving theconnectionless nature of IP.

Title: Load-Sensitive Routing of Long-Lived IP Flows
Abstract: Internet service providers face a daunting challenge in provisioningnetwork resources, due to therapid growth of the Internet and wide fluctuations in the underlyingtraffic patterns. The ability of dynamicrouting to circumvent congested links and improve applicationperformance makes it a valuabletraffic engineering tool. However, deployment of load-sensitiverouting is hampered by the overheadsimposed by link-state update propagation, path selection, andsignalling. Under reasonable protocol andcomputational overheads, traditional approaches to load-sensitiverouting of IP traffic are ineffective,and can introduce significant route flapping, since paths areselected based on out-of-date link-state information.Although stability is improved by performing load-sensitive routingat the flow level, flappingstill occurs, because most IP flows have a short duration relative tothe desired frequency of link-stateupdates.

The Tiny Tera is a CMOS-basedinput-queued,fixed-size packet switch suitable for a wide range of applicationssuch as a highperformanceATM switch, the core of an Internet router or as a fastmultiprocessorinterconnect. Using off-the-shelf technology, we plan to demonstratethat a very highbandwidthswitch can be built without the need for esoteric optical switchingtechnology. By employing novel scheduling algorithms for both unicastand multicasttraffic, the switch will have a maximum throughput close to 100%.Using novel highspeedchip-to-chip serial link technology, we plan to reduce the physicalsize andcomplexity of the switch, as well as the system pin-count.1 IntroductionThe case for high-performance networking is overwhelming; the trafficon the Internet continuesto grow at over 30% per month with no apparent end in sight.

Title: Resource-based Caching for Web Servers
Abstract: The WWW employs a hierarchical data dissemination architecture inwhich hyper-media objects stored at a remote server areserved to clients across the internet, and cached on disks atintermediate proxy servers. One of the objectives of web cachingalgorithms is to maximize the data transferred from the proxy serversor cache hierarchies. Current web caching algorithms aredesigned only for text and image data. Recent studies predict thatwithin the next five years more than half the objects stored atweb servers will contain continuous media data. To support thesetrends, the next generation proxy cache algorithms will needto handle multiple data types, each with different cache resourceusage, for a cache limited by both bandwidth and space.In this paper, we present a resource-based caching (RBC) algorithmthat manages the heterogeneous requirements of multipledata types.

We expectthese codes will be extremely useful for applications such asreal-time audio and videotransmission over the Internet, where lossy channels are common andfast decoding isa requirement.Despite the simplicity of the algorithms, their design and analysisare mathematicallyintricate. The design requires the careful choice of a randomirregular bipartitegraph, where the structure of the irregular graph is extremelyimportant.

Title: Analysis of Techniques to Improve Protocol Processing Latency
Abstract: This paper describes several techniques designed to improve protocollatency, and reports on their effectivenesswhen measured on a modern RISC machine employing the DEC Alphaprocessor. We found thatthe memory system---which has long been known to dominate networkthroughput---is also a key factorin protocol latency. In particular, improving instruction cacheeffectiveness can greatly reduce protocolprocessing overheads. An important metric in this context is thememory cycles per instructions (mCPI),which is the average number of cycles that an instruction stallswaiting for a memory access to complete.The techniques presented in this paper reduce the mCPI by up to afactor of 5.8. In analyzing the effectivenessof the techniques, we also present a detailed study of the protocolprocessing behavior of two protocolstacks---TCP/IP and RPC---on a modern RISC processor.Department of Computer ScienceThe University of ArizonaTucson, AZ 857211This work supported in part by ARPA ...

Title: Protocols for adaptive wireless and mobile networking
Abstract: this article, we give a status report of our current work in theMonarch Project, placing it in thecontext of broader efforts by the Internet mobile networkingcommunity.Our work will enable mobile hosts to communicate with each other andwith stationary or wiredhosts, transparently making the most efficient use of the bestnetwork connectivity available to the mobilehost at any time. To this end, the networking protocols must supportadaptive operation in a number ofways. For example, host mobility means that protocols must be able toadapt packet routing to reacheach mobile host in its current location. In addition, differentwireless networks, intended for examplefor local-area, metropolitan-area, and wide-area use, make differenttradeoffs in factors such as bandwidth,latency, error rate, and usage cost, providing different levels ofquality of network connection with eachwireless networking product or service. Network protocols should beable to adapt to optimize use of thebest available network connection for each mobile host at any time.Further, in order to allow higher-layerprotocols and applications to adapt to these changes in networkconnection quality, network protocols shouldbe able to provide information to higher layers when such changestake place.We are experimenting with our protocols in the context of the"Wireless Andrew" infrastructure,currentlybeing built at Carnegie Mellon [10].

Abstract: We characterize the polynomial time computable queries as thoseexpressiblein relational calculus plus a least fixed point operator and a totalordering on the universe. We also show that even without the orderingone application of fixed point suffices to express any queryexpressiblewith several alternations of fixed point and negation. This provesthatthe fixed point query hierarchy suggested by Chandra and Harelcollapsesat the first fixed point level. It is also a general result showingthat infinite model theory one application of fixed point suffices.Introduction and SummaryQuery languages for relational databases have received considerableattention.In 1972 Codd showed that two natural languages for queries -- onealgebraicand the other a version of first order predicate calculus -- haveidentical powersof expressibility, [Cod72].

Abstract: this paper a series of languages adequate for expressing exactlythose properties checkable in a series of computational complexityclasses. Forexample, we show that a property of graphs (respectively groups,binary strings,etc.) is in polynomial time if and only if it is expressible in thefirst orderlanguage of graphs (respectively groups, binary strings, etc.)together with aleast fixed point operator. As another example, a property is inlogspace if andonly if it is expressible in first order logic together with adeterministic transitiveclosure operator.The roots of our approach to complexity theory go back to 1974 whenFaginshowed that the NP properties are exactly those expressible in secondorderexistential sentences. It follows that second order logic expressesexactly thoseproperties which are in the polynomial time hierarchy. We show thataddingsuitable transitive closure operators to second order logic resultsin languagescapturing polynomial space and exponential time, respectively.The existence of such natural languages for each important complexityclasssheds a new light on complexity theory. These languages reaffirm theimportanceof the complexity classes as much more than machine dependent issues.Furthermore a whole new approach is suggested. Upper bounds(algorithms)can be produced by expressing the property of interest in one of ourlanguages.Lower bounds may be demonstrated by showing that such expression isimpossible.

Abstract: . Currently, most approaches to retrieving textual materials fromscientific databases depend on a lexical match between words inusers' requests and those in or assigned to documents in a database.Because of the tremendous diversity in the words people use todescribe the same document, lexical methods are necessarilyincomplete and imprecise. Using the singular value decomposition(SVD), one can take advantage of the implicit higher-order structurein the association of terms with documents by determining the SVD oflarge sparse term by document matrices. Terms and documentsrepresented by 200-300 of the largest singular vectors are thenmatched against user queries. We call this retrieval method LatentSemantic Indexing (LSI) because the subspace represents importantassociative relationships between terms and documents that are notevident in individual documents.

A model issubdivided into rectangular cells whose boundaries coincide withmajor opaque surfaces. Non-opaque portals are identified on cellboundaries, and used to form an adjacency graph connecting the cellsof the subdivision. Next, the cell-to-cell visibility is computed foreach cell of the subdivision, by linking pairs of cells between whichunobstructed sightlines exist.

For thesetypes of restrictions, I show when planning is tractable (polynomial)and intractable (NPhard). In general, it is PSPACE-complete to determine if a given planninginstance has anysolutions. Extremely severe restrictions on both the operators andthe formulas are requiredto guarantee polynomial time or even NP-completeness. For example,when only groundliterals are permitted, determining plan existence is PSPACE-completeeven if operators arelimited to two preconditions and two postconditions.

Abstract: . This paper is essentially tutorial in nature. We show how anydiscrete wavelettransform or two band subband filtering with finite filters can bedecomposed into a finitesequence of simple filtering steps, which we call lifting steps butthat are also known as ladderstructures. This decomposition corresponds to a factorization of thepolyphase matrix of thewavelet or subband filters into elementary matrices. That such afactorization is possible iswell-known to algebraists (and expressed by the formula SL(n; R[z; z\Gamma1]) = E(n; R[z;z\Gamma1]));it is also used in linear systems theory in the electricalengineering community. We presenthere a self-contained derivation, building the decomposition frombasic principles such as theEuclidean algorithm, with a focus on applying it to waveletfiltering. This factorization providesan alternative for the lattice factorization, with the advantage thatit can also be used in thebiorthogonal, i.e, non-unitary case. Like the la...

Instead of using pointers to indicatethe topology of the tree, we identify each possible cell with a key.The mapping of keys into memory locations is achieved via a hashtable. This allows the program to access data in an efficient manneracross multiple processors. Performance of the parallel program ismeasured on the 512 processor Intel Touchstone Delta system.

The ultimategoal in this direction is informally termed agnostic learning, inwhich we make virtually no assumptions on the target function. Thename derives from the fact that as designers of learning algorithms,we give up the belief that Nature (as represented by the targetfunction) has a simple or succinct explanation. We give a number ofpositive and negative results that provide an initial outline of thepossibilities for agnostic learning. Our results include hardnessresults for the most obvious generalization of the PAC model to anagnostic setting, an efficient and general agnostic learning methodbased on dynamic programming, relationships between loss functionsfor agnostic learning, and an algorithm for a learning problem thatinvolves hidden variables.

Title: Optimizing Power Using Transformations
Abstract: : The increasing demand for portable computing has elevated powerconsumption to be one of the most critical design parameters. Ahigh-level synthesis system, HYPER-LP, is presented for minimizingpower consumption in application specific datapath intensive CMOScircuits using a variety of architectural and computationaltransformations. The synthesis environment consists of high-levelestimation of power consumption, a library of transformationprimitives, and heuristic/probabilistic optimization searchmechanisms for fast and efficient scanning of the design space.Examples with varying degree of computational complexity andstructures are optimized and synthesized using the HYPER-LP system.The results indicate that more than an order of magnitude reductionin power can be achieved over current-day design methodologies whilemaintaining the system throughput; in some cases this can beaccomplished while preserving or reducing the implementation area.1.0 Introduction VLSI research a...

We investigatethenumber of the above gates required to implement other gates, such asgeneralizedDeutsch-Toffoli gates, that apply a specific U(2) transformation tooneinput bit if and only if the logical AND of all remaining input bitsis satisfied.

We prove that reasoning in theORD-Horn subclass is a polynomial-time problem and show that thepath-consistency method is sufficient for deciding satisfiability.Further, using an extensive machine-generated case analysis, we showthat the ORD-Horn subclass is a maximal tractable subclass of thefull algebra (assuming P!=NP). In fact, it is the unique greatesttractable subclass amongst the subclasses that contain all basicrelations.

Title: Gap-Definable Counting Classes
Abstract: The function class #P lacks an important closure property: it is notclosed under subtraction. To remedy this problem, we introduce thefunction class GapP as a natural alternative to #P. GapP is theclosure of #P under subtraction, and has all the other useful closureproperties of #P as well. We show that most previously studiedcounting classes, including PP , C=P , and Mod k P , are"gap-definable," i.e., definable using the values of GapPfunctions alone. We show that there is a smallest gap-definableclass, SPP , which is still large enough to contain Few. We also showthat SPP consists of exactly those languages low for GapP, and thusSPP languages are low for any gap-definable class. These resultsunify and improve earlier disparate results of Cai & Hemachandra[7] and Kobler, Schoning, Toda, & Tor'an [15]. We show furtherthat any countable collection of languages is contained in a uniqueminimum gap-definable class, which implies that the gap-definableclasses form a lattic...

Title: Training models of shape from sets of examples
Abstract: A method for building flexible shape models is presented in which ashape is represented by a set of labelled points. The techniquedetermines the statistics of the points over a collection of exampleshapes. The mean positions of the points give an average shape and anumber of modes of variation are deter# mined describing the mainways in which the example shapes tend to deform from the average. Inthis way allowed variation in shape can be included in the model. Themethod produces a compact flexible `Point Distribution Model' with asmall number of linearly independent parameters, which can be usedduring image search. We demonstrate the application of the PointDistribution Model in describing two classes of shapes. 1Introduction We have previously described a method for modelling twodimensional shape, based on the statistics of chord lengths over aset of examples [12]. Although this provided a means of automaticallyparameterising shape variability, the method was difficult ...

Title: Wavelet Radiosity
Abstract: Radiosity methods have been shown to be an effective meansto solve the global illumination problem in Lambertian diffuseenvironments. These methods approximate the radiosity integralequation by projecting the unknown radiosity function into a setof basis functions with limited support resulting in a set of nlinear equations where n is the number of discrete elements in thescene. Classical radiosity methods required the evaluation of n2interaction coefficients. Efforts to reduce the number of requiredcoefficients without compromising error bounds have focused onraising the order of the basis functions, meshing, accounting fordiscontinuities, and on developing hierarchical approaches, whichhave been shown to reduce the required interactions to O(n).In this paper we show that the hierarchical radiosity formulationis an instance of a more general set of methods based on wavelettheory.

Abstract: Knowledge discovery in databases, or data mining,is an important issue in the development of data- andknowledge-base systems. An attribute-oriented inductionmethod has been developed for knowledge discovery indatabases. The method integrates a machine learningparadigm, especially learning-from-examples techniques,with set-oriented database operations and extracts generalizeddata from actual data in databases. Anattribute-oriented concept tree ascension technique isapplied in generalization, which substantially reduces thecomputational complexity of database learningprocesses.

Abstract: Terminological reasoning is a mode of reasoning all hybrid knowledgerepresentation systems based on KL-ONE rely on. After a shortintroductionof what terminological reasoning amounts to, it is proven that acompleteinference algorithm for the BACK system would be computationallyintractable. Interestingly, this result also applies to the KANDORsystem,which had been conjectured to realize complete terminologicalinferenceswith a tractable algorithm. More generally, together with an earlierpaperof Brachman and Levesque it shows that terminological reasoning isintractablefor any system using a non-trivial description language.

Abstract: Recently a great deal of attention has focused on quantum computationfollowing a sequence of results [4, 16, 15] suggesting that quantumcomputers are more powerful than classical probabilistic computers.Following Shor's result that factoring and the extraction of discretelogarithms are both solvable in quantum polynomial time, it isnatural to ask whether all of NP can be efficiently solved in quantumpolynomial time. In this paper, we address this question by provingthat relative to an oracle chosen uniformly at random, withprobability 1, the class NP cannot be solved on a quantum Turingmachine in time o(2 n=2 ). We also show that relative to apermutation oracle chosen uniformly at random, with probability 1,the class NP " co--NP cannot be solved on a quantum Turingmachine in time o(2 n=3 ).

Title: Scalable parallel data mining for association rules
Abstract: One of the important problems in data mining is discoveringassociation rules from databases of transactions where eachtransaction consists of a set of items. The most time consumingoperation in this discovery process is the computation of thefrequency of the occurrences of interesting subset of items (calledcandidates) in the database of transactions. To prune theexponentially large space of candidates, most existing algorithms,consider only those candidates that have a user defined minimumsupport. Even with the pruning, the task of finding all associationrules requires a lot of computation power and time. Parallelcomputers offer a potential solution to the computation requirementof this task, provided efficient and scalable parallel algorithms canbe designed. In this paper, we present two new parallel algorithmsfor mining association rules.

Abstract: Numerous sophisticated techniques have been developed over the lastseveraldecades to efficiently transmit images across noisy channels. Here,we cascadean existing image coder with carefully chosen error control coding,and thusproduce a progressive image compression scheme whose performance on anoisychannel is significantly better than that of previously known imagecompressiontechniques. The main idea is to trade off the available transmissionrate betweensource coding and channel coding in an efficient manner. This codingsystem iseasy to implement and has acceptably low complexity. Furthermore,effectivelyno degradation due to channel noise can be detected; instead, thepenalty paiddue to channel noise is a reduction in source coding resolution.

Our results provide a syntactic characterization ofcomputational classes, and give acomputational framework for syntactic classes.We compare the syntactically defined class MAX SNP with thecomputationally defined class APX,and show that every problem in APX can be "placed" (i.e.,has approximation preserving reductionto a problem) in MAX SNP. Our methods introduce a simple, yetgeneral, technique for creatingapproximation-preserving reductions which show that any"well" approximable problem can be reducedin an approximation-preserving manner to a problem which is hard toapproximate to correspondingfactors.

In [1] we developed aprovably good approximationalgorithm for the minimum-time trajectory problem for a robot systemwith decoupleddynamics bounds (e.g., a point robot in R3). This algorithm differs from previous work in threeways. It is possible (1) to bound the goodness of the approximationby an error term ffl; (2)to polynomially bound the computational complexity of our algorithm;and (3) to express thecomplexity as a polynomial function of the error term.

This problem occurs frequentlyin the production of many types of informational graphics, though itarises most often in automated cartography.

Furthermore, the packets can betruncated to instantaneously meet the time varying bandwidth imposedby a TCP-friendly transport protocol.

However, they were not seriously appliedto linearprogramming because of the dominance of the simplex method.

In 1984,Karmarkar'sannouncement of a fast polynomial-time interior method for linearprogrammingcaused tremendous excitement in the field of optimization. A formalconnectioncan be shown between his method and classical barrier methods, whichhaveconsequently undergone a renaissance in interest and popularity.

Abstract: A directed graph is said to be upward planar if it can be drawn inthe plane such that every edge is a monotonically increasing curve inthe vertical direction, and no two edges cross. An undirected graphis said to be rectilinear planar if it can be drawn in the plane suchthat every edge is a horizontal or vertical segment, and no two edgescross. Testing upward planarity and rectilinear planarity arefundamental problems in the effective visualization of various graphand network structures. For example, upward planarity is useful forthe display of order diagrams and subroutine-call graphs, whilerectilinear planarity is useful for the display of circuit schematicsand entity-relationship diagrams. In this paper we show that upwardplanarity testing and rectilinear planarity testing are NP-completeproblems.

For along time,the notion of complexity referred to the time or space used in thecomputation.A mathematician might ask, "What is the complexity of expressingthe property S?" It should not be surprising that these twoquestions -- thatof checking and that of expressing -- are related. However it isstartling howclosely tied they are when the second question refers to expressingthe propertyin first-order logic. Many complexity classes originally defined intermsof time or space resources have precise definitions as classes infirst-orderlogic.In 1974 Fagin gave a characterization of nondeterministic polynomialtime (NP) as the set of properties expressible in second-orderexistentiallogic.

Title: The Quantitative Structure of Exponential Time
Abstract: Recent results on the internal, measure-theoreticstructure of the exponential time complexity classesE = DTIME(2linear) and E 2 = DTIME(2polynomial)are surveyed. The measure structure of these classes isseen to interact in informative ways with bi-immunity,complexity cores, Pm -reducibility, circuit-size complexity,Kolmogorov complexity, and the density ofhard languages. Possible implications for the structureof NP are also discussed.1 IntroductionIn the past three years, new developments inresource-bounded measure have opened the way fora systematic investigation of the internal, measuretheoreticstructure of the exponential time complexityclasses E = DTIME(2linear) and E 2 =DTIME(2polynomial). The investigation is very farfrom complete, but it has already yielded a numberof interesting insights and results.

Title: Data Mining: The Search for Knowledge in Databases
Abstract: Data mining is the search for relationships and global patterns thatexist in large databases, but are `hidden'among the vast amounts of data, such as a relationship betweenpatient data and their medical diagnosis.These relationships represent valuable knowledge about the databaseand objects in the database and, if thedatabase is a faithful mirror, of the real world registered by thedatabase.One of the main problems for data mining is that the number ofpossible relationships is very large, thusprohibiting the search for the correct ones by simple validating eachof them. Hence, we need intelligent searchstrategies, as taken from the area of machine learning.Another important problem is that information in data objects isoften corrupted or missing. Hence,statistical techniques should be applied to estimate the reliabilityof the discovered relationships.This report provides a survey of current data mining research, itpresents the main underlying ideas,such as inductive l...

Title: On the computational complexity of approximating distributions by probabilistic automata
Abstract: We introduce a rigorous performance criterion for training algorithmsfor probabilistic automata (PAs) and hidden Markov models (HMMs),used extensively for speech recognition, and analyze the complexityof the training problem as a computational problem. The PA trainingproblem is the problem of approximating an arbitrary, unknown sourcedistribution by distributions generated by a PA. We investigate thefollowing question about this important, well-studied problem: Doesthere exist an *efficient* training algorithm such that the trainedPAs *provably converge* to a model close to an optimum one with highconfidence, after only a feasibly small set of training data? Wemodel this problem in the framework of computational learning theoryand analyze the sample as well as computational complexity. We showthat the number of examples required for training PAs is moderate --essentially linear in the number of transition probabilities to betrained and a low-degree polynomial in the example length andparameters quantifying the accuracy and confidence. Computationally,however, training PAs is quite demanding: Fixed state size PAs aretrainable in time polynomial in the accuracy and confidenceparameters and example length, but *not* in the alphabet size, unlessRP = NP. The latter result is shown via a strong non-approximabilityresult for the single string maximum likelihood model problem for2-state PAs, which is of independent interest.

Title: Natural proofs
Abstract: . We introduce the notion of natural proof. We argue that the knownproofs of lower bounds on the complexity of explicit Booleanfunctions in nonmonotonemodels fall within our definition of natural. We show based on ahardnessassumption that natural proofs can't prove superpolynomial lowerboundsfor general circuits. Without the hardness assumption, we are able toshow thatthey can't prove exponential lower bounds (for general circuits)applicable to thediscrete logarithm problem. We show that the weaker class of AC0-natural proofswhich is sufficient to prove the parity lower bounds of Furst, Saxe,and Sipser;Yao; and Hastad is inherently incapable of proving the bounds ofRazborov andSmolensky. We give some formal evidence that natural proofs areindeed naturalby showing that every formal complexity measure which can provesuperpolynomiallower bounds for a single function, can do so for almost allfunctions,which is one of the key requirements to a natural proof in our ...

Title: Automated Analysis of Concurrent Systems With the Constrained Expression Toolset
Abstract: The constrained expression approach to analysis of concurrentsoftwaresystems has several attractive features, including the facts that itcan be used with a variety of design and programming languages andthatit does not require a complete enumeration of the set of reachablestatesof the concurrent system. This paper reports on the construction of atoolset automating the main constrained expression analysistechniquesand the results of experiments with that toolset. The toolset iscapableof carrying out completely automated analyses of a variety ofconcurrentsystems, starting from source code in an Ada-like design language andproducing system traces displaying the properties represented by theanalyst's queries. It has been successfully used with designs that involvehundreds of concurrent processes.This paper appeared in IEEE Trans. Softw.

However, whichever ofthese options areselected, the choice of a representation for the extension of thetemporal attributes remainsa fundamental issue.To appear in: A. T...

Abstract: Many AI problems, when formalized, reduce to evaluating theprobability that a propositional expression is true. In this paper weshow that this problem is computationally intractable even insurprisingly restricted cases and even if we settle for anapproximation to this probability. We consider various methods usedin approximate reasoning such as computing degree of belief andBayesian belief networks, as well as reasoning techniques such asconstraint satisfaction and knowledge compilation, that useapproximation to avoid computational difficulties, and reduce them tomodel-counting problems over a propositional domain. We prove thatcounting satisfying assignments of propositional languages isintractable even for Horn and monotone formulae, and even when thesize of clauses and number of occurrences of the variables areextremely limited. This should be contrasted with the case ofdeductive reasoning, where Horn theories and theories with binaryclauses are distinguished by the e...

Title: On the Decidability of Query Containment under Constraints
Abstract: Query containment under constraints is the problem of checkingwhether for every database satisfying a given set of constraints, theresult of one query is a subset of the result of another query.Recent research points out that this is a central problem in severaldatabase applications, and we address it within a setting whereconstraints are specified in the form of special inclusiondependencies over complex expressions, built by using intersectionand difference of relations, special forms of quantification, regularexpressions over binary relations, and cardinality constraints. Thesetypes of constraints capture a great variety of data models,including the relational, the entity-relational, and theobject-oriented model. We study the problem of checking whether q iscontained in q 0 with respect to the constraints specified in aschema S, where q and q 0 are nonrecursive Datalog programs whoseatoms are complex expressions.

Abstract: Many representations for probabilistic propositionalplanning problems have been studied. This paper reviewsseveral such representations and shows that, inspite of superficial differences between the representations,they are "expressively equivalent," meaningthat planning problems specified in one representationcan be converted to equivalent planning problemsin any of the other representations with at mosta polynomial factor increase in the size of the resultingrepresentation and the number of steps needed toreach the goal with sufficient probability. The paperproves that the computational complexity of determiningwhether a successful plan exists for planningproblems expressed in any of these representationsis EXPTIME-complete and PSPACE-complete whenplans are restricted to take a polynomial number ofsteps.IntroductionIn recent years, there has been an interest in solvingplanning problems that contain some degree of uncertainty.One form that this uncertainty has tak...

Title: A Unifying Framework for Structure and Motion Recovery from Image Sequences
Abstract: This paper proposes a statistical framework that enables3D structure and motion to be computed optimallyfrom an image sequence, on the assumption that featuremeasurement errors are independent and Gaussiandistributed. The analysis and results demonstrate thatcomputing both camera/scene motion and 3D structureis essential to computing either with any accuracy.Having computed optimal estimates of structure andmotion over a small number of initial images, a recursiveversion of the algorithm (previously reported) recomputessub-optimal estimates given new image data.The algorithm is designed explicitly for real-time implementation,and the complexity is proportional to thenumber of tracked features. 3D projective, affine andEuclidean models of structure and motion recovery havebeen implemented, incorporating both point and line featuresinto the computation. The framework can handleany feature type and camera model that may be encapsulatedas a projection equation from scene to image.

These experimentswere run to gain an understanding of the properties of the set ofconsistent decision trees and the factors that affect the accuracy ofindividual trees. In particular, we investigated the relationshipbetween the size of a decision tree consistent with some trainingdata and the accuracy of the tree on test data.

Abstract: Luby and Rackoff [27] showed a method for constructing apseudo-random permutation froma pseudo-random function. The method is based on composing four (orthree for weakened security)so called Feistel permutations, each of which requires the evaluationof a pseudo-randomfunction. We reduce somewhat the complexity of the construction andsimplify its proof of securityby showing that two Feistel permutations are sufficient together withinitial and final pair-wise independentpermutations. The revised construction and proof provide a frameworkin which similarconstructions may be brought up and their security can be easilyproved. We demonstrate this bypresenting some additional adjustments of the construction thatachieve the following:ffl Reduce the success probability of the adversary.ffl Provide a construction of pseudo-random permutations with largeinput size using pseudorandomfunctions with small input size.Incumbent of the Morris and Rose Goldman Career Development ...

In this paper we examine and evaluate approaches forinducing classifiers from data, based on recent results in the theoryof learning Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks are factoredrepresentations of probability distributions that generalize thenaive Bayes classifier and explicitly represent statements aboutindependence. Among these approacheswe single out a method we callTree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), which outperforms naive Bayes, yetat the same time maintains the computational simplicity (no searchinvolved) and robustness which are characteristic of naive Bayes.

Title: A Simple and Fast Incremental Randomized Algorithm for Computing Trapezoidal Decompositions and for Triangulating Polygons
Abstract: This paper presents a very simple incremental randomized algorithmfor computing the trapezoidal decomposition induced by a set S of nline segments in the plane. If S is given as a simple polygonal chainthe expected running time of the algorithm is O(n log n). This leadsto a simple algorithm of the same complexity for triangulatingpolygons. More generally, if S is presented as a plane graph with kconnected components, then the expected running time of the algorithmis O(n log n k log n). As a by-product our algorithm creates a searchstructure of expected linear size that allows point location queriesin the resulting trapezoidation in logarithmic expected time. Theanalysis of the expected performance is elementary andstraightforward. All expectations are with respect to"coinflips" generated by the algorithm and are not based onassumptions about the geometric distribution of the input.

Abstract: A new approach to regularization methods for image processing isintroduced anddeveloped using as a vehicle the problem of computing dense opticalflow fields in animage sequence.

Weutilize the interpretationof the smoothness constraint as a "fractal prior" tomotivate regularization based ona recently introduced class of multiscale stochastic models. Thesolution of the newproblem formulation is computed with an efficient multiscalealgorithm. Experimentson several image sequences demonstrate the substantial computationalsavings that canbe achieved due to the fact that the algorithm is non-iterative andin fact has a perpixel computational complexity which is independent of image size.The new approachalso has a number of other important advantages.

Title: A Unified Framework for Class-Based Representation Formalisms
Abstract: The notion of class is ubiquitous in Computer Science and is centralin many knowledge representation languages. In this paper we proposea representation formalism in the style of concept languages, withthe aim of providing a unified framework for class-based formalisms.The language we consider is quite expressive and features a novelcombination of constructs including number restrictions, inverseroles and inclusion assertions with no restrictions on cycles. We areable to show that such language is powerful enough to model framesystems, object-oriented database languages and semantic data models.As a consequence of the established correspondences, severalsignificant extensions of each of the above formalisms becomeavailable. The high expressivity of the language and the need forcapturing the reasoning in different contexts forces us todistinguish between unrestricted and finite model reasoning. Anotable feature of our proposal is that reasoning in both cases isdecidable. Fo...

We prove that the decision version of this problem is NP-Hard.

Clustering and region oriented queries are common problemsin this domain. Several approaches have been presented in recentyears, all of which require at least one scan of all individualobjects (points). Consequently, the computational complexity is atleast linearly proportional to the number of objects to answer eachquery. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical statisticalinformation grid based approach for spatial data mining to reduce thecost further. The idea is to capture statistical informationassociated with spatial cells in such a manner that whole classes ofqueries and clustering problems can be answered without recourse tothe individual objects.

Abstract: The research on conditional planning rejects the assumptions thatthere is no uncertaintyor incompleteness of knowledge with respect to the state and changesof the system theplans operate on. Without these assumptions the sequences ofoperations that achievethe goals depend on the initial state and the outcomes ofnondeterministic changes in thesystem. This setting raises the questions of how to represent theplans and how to performplan search.

Instead, we translate conditional planning to quantifiedBoolean formulae. Wediscuss three formalizations of conditional planning as quantifiedBoolean formulae, andpresent exper...

The resulting wavelet packet coder offers anuniversal transform coding framework within the constraints of filterbank structures by allowing joint transform and quantizer designwithout assuming a priori statistics of the input image. In otherwords, the new coder adaptively chooses the representation to suitthe image and the quantization to suit the representation.Experimental results show that, for some image classes, our new codergives excellent coding performance. 1 Introduction Recently, wavelettransforms have attracted considerable attention, especially withapplications to image coding, due to their ability to provideattractive space-frequency resolution tradeoffs for natural images[3, 4].

Given a particularisovalue, all cells in S which intersect the given isocontourare extracted using a high-performance range search. Eachconnected component is swept out using a fast isocontourpropagation algorithm. The computational complexity forthe repeated action of seed point selection and isocontourpropagation is O(logn0+ k), where n0is the size of S andk is the size of the output.

Title: Context-Based Vision: Recognizing Objects Using Information from Both 2-D and 3-D Imagery
Abstract: This paper describes results from an ongoing project concerned withrecognizing objectsin complex scene domains, and especially in the domain that includesthe naturaloutdoor world. Traditional machine recognition paradigms assumeeither (1) that allobjects of interest are definable by a relatively small number ofexplicit shape models,or (2) that all objects of interest have characteristic, locallymeasurable features. Thefailure of both assumptions in a complex domain such as the naturaloutdoor world hasa dramatic impact on the form of an acceptable architecture for anobject recognitionsystem.In our work, we make the use of contextual information a centralissue, and explicitlydesign a system to identify and use context as an integral part ofrecognition.In so doing, we provide a new paradigm for visual recognition thateliminates thetraditional dependence on stored geometric models and universal imagepartitioningalgorithms. This paradigm combines the results of many s...

Title: The quadratic assignment problem: a survey and recent developments
Abstract: . Quadratic Assignment Problems model many applications indiverse areas such as operations research, parallel and distributedcomputing,and combinatorial data analysis. In this paper we survey some ofthe most important techniques, applications, and methods regardingthequadratic assignment problem. We focus our attention on recentdevelopments.1. IntroductionGiven a set N = f1; 2; : : : ; ng and n \Theta n matrices F = (f ij )and D = (d kl ),the quadratic assignment problem (QAP) can be stated as follows:minp2\Pi NnXi=1nXj=1f ij d p(i)p(j) +nXi=1c ip(i) ;where \Pi N is the set of all permutations of N . One of the majorapplications ofthe QAP is in location theory where the matrix F = (f ij ) is theflow matrix,i.e. f ij is the flow of materials from facility i to facility j, andD = (d kl ) is thedistance matrix, i.e. d kl represents the distance from location k tolocation l[62, 67, 137].

To encouragefuture research, we sketch some alternativemethods of analysis that rely on the structureof MDPs.1 INTRODUCTIONA Markov decision process is a controlled stochasticprocess satisfying the Markov property with costs assignedto state transitions.

Abstract: The family of terminological representation systems has its roots intherepresentation system kl-one. Since the development of kl-one morethan a dozen similar representation systems have been developed byvariousresearch groups. These systems vary along a number of dimensions.In this paper, we present the results of an empirical analysis of sixsuchsystems.

Additionally, the runtime performance between differentsystemsand knowledge bases varied more than we expected. Finally, ourempiricalruntime performance results give an idea of what runtime performancetoexpect from such representation systems. These findings complementpreviouslyreported analytical results about the computational complexity ofreasoning in such systems.This work has been carried out in the WIP project which is supportedby the GermanMinistry for Research and Tech...

Title: The Dynamic Window Approach to Collision Avoidance
Abstract: This paper describes the dynamic window approach to reactivecollision avoidancefor mobile robots equipped with synchro-drives. The approach isderived directlyfrom the motion dynamics of the robot and is therefore particularlywell-suited forrobots operating at high speed. It differs from previous approachesin that the searchfor commands controlling the translational and rotational velocity ofthe robot iscarried out directly in the space of velocities. The advantage of ourapproach is thatit correctly and in an elegant way incorporates the dynamics of therobot. This is doneby reducing the search space to the dynamic window, which consists ofthe velocitiesreachable within a short time interval. Within the dynamic window theapproach onlyconsiders admissible velocities yielding a trajectory on which therobot is able to stopsafely. Among these velocities the combination of translational androtational velocityis chosen by maximizing an objective function. The objective fu...

Title: Self-fulfilling bias in multiagent learning
Abstract: Learning in a multiagent environment is complicated by the fact thatas other agents learn, the environment effectively changes. Moreover,other agents' actions are often not directly observable, and theactions taken by the learning agent can strongly bias which range ofbehaviors are encountered. We define the concept of a conjecturalequilibrium, where all agents' expectations are realized, and eachagent responds optimally to its expectations. We present a genericmultiagent exchange situation, in which competitive behaviorconstitutes a conjectural equilibrium. We then introduce an agentthat executes a more sophisticated strategic learning strategy,building a model of the response of other agents. We find that thesystem reliably converges to a conjectural equilibrium, but that thefinal result achieved is highly sensitive to initial belief. Inessence, the strategic learner's actions tend to fulfill itsexpectations. Depending on the starting point, the agent may bebetter or ...

Abstract: A system with multiple interacting agents (whether artificial orhuman) is often best analyzedusing game-theoretic tools. Unfortunately, while the formalfoundations are well-established,standard computational techniques for game-theoretic reasoning areinadequate for dealing withrealistic games. This paper describes the Gala system, an implementedsystem that allows thespecification and efficient solution of large imperfect informationgames. The system containsthe first implementation of a recent algorithm, due to Koller,Megiddo, and von Stengel. Experimentalresults from the system demonstrate that the algorithm isexponentially faster thanthe standard algorithm in practice, not just in theory. It thereforeallows the solution of gamesthat are orders of magnitude larger than were previously possible.The system also provides anew declarative language for compactly and naturally representinggames by their rules.

Title: On the Logical Modelling of Computational Multi-Agent Systems
Abstract: THE aim of this thesis is to investigate logical formalisms fordescribing, reasoning about, specifying, and perhapsultimately verifying the properties of systems composed of multipleintelligent computational agents. Thereare two obvious resources available for this task. The first is the(largely AI) tradition of reasoning about theintentional notions (belief, desire, etc.). The second is the(mainstream computer science) tradition of temporallogics for reasoning about reactive systems. Unfortunately, neitherresource is ideally suited to the task: mostintentional logics have little to say on the subject of agentarchitecture, and tend to assume that agents are perfectreasoners, whereas models of concurrent systems from mainstreamcomputer science typically deal with theexecution of individual program instructions.This thesis proposes a solution which draws upon both resources. Itdefines a model of agents and multi-agentsystems, and then defines two execution models, which ...

Title: A Game-Theoretic Approach to Hybrid System Design
Abstract: We present a design and verification methodology for hybrid dynamicalsystems.Our approach is based on optimal control and game theory. The hybriddesign is seenas a game between two players. One is the disturbances that enter thedynamics. Thedisturbances can encode the actions of other agents (in a multi-agentsetting), the actionsof high level controllers or the usual unmodeled environmentaldisturbances. The secondplayer is the control, which is to be chosen by the designer. The twoplayers competeover a cost function that encodes the properties that the closed loophybrid system needsto satisfy (e.g. safety). The control "wins" the game if itcan keep the system "safe" forany allowable disturbance.The solution to the game theory problem provides the designer withcontinuouscontrollers as well as sets of safe states where the control"wins" the game. The setsof safe sets can be used to construct an interface that guaranteesthe safe operation ofthe combined hybrid syste...

Following a short review of conventionsand their use in distributed artificial intelligence, wepresent a formal model that rigorously defines both our experimentalmethodology, and the performance measures weuse to quantify the success of our experiments. We thendescribe sixteen different mechanisms for bringing aboutagreement on conventions, and present experimental resultsobtained for each of these methods.

Title: Learning Models of Intelligent Agents
Abstract: Agents that operate in a multi-agent system need anefficient strategy to handle their encounters with otheragents involved. Searching for an optimal interactivestrategy is a hard problem because it depends mostlyon the behavior of the others. In this work, interactionamong agents is represented as a repeated two-playergame, where the agents' objective is to look for a strategythat maximizes their expected sum of rewards inthe game. We assume that agents' strategies can bemodeled as finite automata. A model-based approachis presented as a possible method for learning an effectiveinteractive strategy. First, we describe how anagent should find an optimal strategy against a givenmodel. Second, we present an unsupervised algorithmthat infers a model of the opponent's automaton fromits input/output behavior. A set of experiments thatshow the potential merit of the algorithm is reportedas well.IntroductionIn recent years, a major research effort has been investedin desi...

Title: Group ability and structure
Abstract: "strategies" (discussed in x5) simplify reactive decisionmaking by letting an agent have partial plans that can be effectivelyfollowed inreal-time.3.3 The New AnalysisA group, G, knows how to achieve A, in loose parlance to"do" A, if it is usually ableto bring about the conditions for A through its actions. The worldmay change rapidlyand unpredictably, but G is able to force the situationappropriately. The group has alimited knowledge of its rapidly changing environment. It has toolittle time to decideon an optimal course of actions, and can succeed only if it has therequired physicalresources and is appropriately attuned to its environment. While this"situated" theorydoes not use plans, it can accommodate the richer notion ofstrategies (see x5).

Title: Sequential Auctions for the Allocation of Resources with Complementarities
Abstract: Market-based mechanisms such as auctions are being studiedas an appropriate means for resource allocation in distributedand multiagent decision problems. When agents value resourcesin combination rather than in isolation, one generallyrelies on combinatorial auctions where agents bid for resourcebundles, or simultaneous auctions for all resources. Wedevelop a different model, where agents bid for required resources sequentially. This model has the advantage that it canbe applied in settings where combinatorial and simultaneousmodels are infeasible (e.g., when resources are made availableat different points in time by different parties), as well as certainbenefits in settings where combinatorial models are applicable.We develop a dynamic programming model for agentsto compute bidding policies based on estimated distributionsover prices. We also describe how these distributions are updatedto provide a learning model for bidding behavior.1 IntroductionA great deal of att...

Abstract: ffiCombinatorial auctions can be used to reach efficient resource andtask allocations in multiagent systems where the items arecomplementary. Determining the winners is NP-complete andinapproximable, but it was recently shown that optimal searchalgorithms do very well on average. This paper presents a moresophisticated search algorithm for optimal (and anytime) winnerdetermination, including structural improvements that reduce searchtree size, faster data structures, and optimizations at search nodesbased on driving toward, identifying and solving tractable specialcases. We also uncover a more general tractable special case, anddesign algorithms for solving it as well as for solving knowntractable special cases substantially faster. We generalizecombinatorial auctions to multiple units of each item, to reserveprices on singletons as well as combinations, and to combinatorialexchanges -- all allowing for substitutability.

Themodel is partitioned into a social level and a strategiclevel, to distinguish between regulations that must beagreed upon and are forced by agent-designers, andstrategies by which each agent acts at will. In addition,we present an implementation of the model andsimulation results.

It also shows that morecoalition formations yield more benefits to the agents.IntroductionAn important method for cooperation in multi-agentenvironments is coalition formation.

We describe Gala,an implemented system that provides the user with avery natural and expressive language for describinggames. From a game description, Gala creates anaugmented game tree with information sets whichcan be used by various algorithms in order to findoptimal strategies for that game. In particular, Galaimplements the first practical algorithm for findingoptimal randomized strategies in two-player imperfectinformation competitive games [Koller et al.,1994] .

Abstract: Task execution in multi-agent environments may require cooperationamong agents. Given a set of agents and a set of tasks which theyhave to satisfy, we consider situations where each task should beattached to a group of agents that will perform the task. Taskallocation to groups of agents is necessary when tasks cannot beperformed by a single agent. However it may also be beneficial whengroups perform more efficiently with respect to the single agents'performance. In this paper we present several solutions to theproblem of task allocation among autonomous agents, and suggest thatthe agents form coalitions in order to perform tasks or improve theefficiency of their performance. We present efficient distributedalgorithms with low ratio bounds and with low computationalcomplexities. These properties are proven theoretically and supportedby simulations and an implementation in an agent system. Our methodsare based on both the algorithmic aspects of combinatorics andapproximat...

However, thereare strong similarities between the objects, actions and attributesof the data model and those of the user interface.This means that considerable specification work has to bedone twice. Our approach is to automatically generate userinterface elements directly from the data model. This savestime and effort and at the same time style rules can be appliedautomatically to the design of the user interface. Thisrelieves the designer of the need to be familiar with certainstyle rules, while at the same time creating the consistencyembodied in the rules.IntroductionAn early step in the design of an interactive application isthe definition of the application's data model.

Transportable documents are those in which thedocument structure can be accessed across system environmentsindependently of individual component input or output dependencies;dynamic documents are those in which the synchronization of documentcomponents are not staticly defined as an integral part of the datadefinition but are dynamicly defined as attributes of the generaldocument structure. The focus of this paper is the presentation ofthe basic building blocks of the CWI Multimedia Interchange Format(CMIF). CMIF is used to describe the temporal and structuralrelationships that exist in multimedia documents.

The design and use of eXene is inextricably wovenwith the presenceof multiple threads and a high-level language. These features replacethe object-orienteddesign of most toolkits, and provide a better basis for dealing withthe complexities of userinterfaces, especially concerning such aspects as type safety,extensibility, component reuseand the balance between the user interface and other parts of theprogram.4.1 INTRODUCTIONIn two previous papers [Rep86, Gan92], we have advocated an approachto the design ofa foundation for graphical user interfaces and interactiveapplications.

Title: A Survey of Methods for Scaling Up Inductive Learning Algorithms
Abstract: : Each year, one of the explicit challenges for the KDD researchcommunity is to developmethods that facilitate the use of inductive learning algorithms formining very large databases.By collecting, categorizing, and summarizing past work on scaling upinductive learning algorithms,this paper serves to establish a common ground for researchersaddressing the challenge.We begin with a discussion of important, but often tacit, issuesrelated to scaling up learningalgorithms. We highlight similarities among methods by categorizingthem into three main approaches.For each approach, we then describe, compare, and contrast thedifferent constituentmethods, drawing on specific examples from the published literature.Finally, we use the precedinganalysis to suggest how one should proceed when dealing with a largeproblem, and wherefuture research efforts should be focused.Primary contact:Foster ProvostNYNEX Science and Technology, 400 Westchester Avenue, White Plains,NY 10604em...

Title: CRANIUM: An Interface for Message Passing on Adaptive Packet Routing Networks
Abstract: . Cranium is a processor-network interface for an interconnectionnetwork based on adaptive packet routing. Adaptive networksrelax the restriction that packet order is preserved; packets may bedeliveredto their destinations in an arbitrary sequence. Cranium uses twomechanisms: an automatic-receive interface for packet serializationandhigh performance, and a processor-initiated interface forflexibility. Tominimize software overhead, Cranium is directly accessible byuser-levelprograms. Protection for user-level message passing is implemented bymapping user-level handles into physical node identifiers and bufferaddresses.1 IntroductionScalable multicomputer architectures have been converging on astandard organizationwith four elements: a workstation microprocessor, main memory basedon dynamic RAM, a point-to-point interconnection network and aprocessornetworkinterface.

Abstract: Recommender systems improve access to relevant productsand information by making personalized suggestions basedon previous examples of a user's likes and dislikes.

By contrast,content-based methods use information about an itemitself to make suggestions. This approach has the advantageof being able to recommended previously unrated items tousers with unique interests and to provide explanations forits recommendations.

Title: Filtering with Approximate Predicates
Abstract: Approximate predicates can be used to reducethe number of comparisons made by expensive,complex predicates. For example,to check if a point is within a region (expensivepredicate) we can first check if thepoint is within a bounding rectangle (approximatepredicate). In general, approximatepredicates may have false positive and falsenegative errors. In this paper we study theproblem of selecting and structuring approximatepredicates in order to reduce the costof processing a user query, while keeping errorswithin user-specified bounds. We modeldifferent types of approximate predicates andtheir dependencies, we derive expressions forthe errors of compound predicates, and wedevelop query optimization strategies. Wealso study the complexity of our optimizationstrategies under various scenarios, andwe present an experimental case study thatillustrates the potential gains achieved by optimizingqueries with approximate predicates.1 IntroductionAs database systems are u...

Abstract: In a digital library, there are many different interaction modelsbetween customers and information providers or merchants.Subscriptions, sessions, pay-per-view, shareware,and pre-paid vouchers are different models that each havedifferent properties. A single merchant may use several ofthem. Yet if a merchant wants to support multiple models,there is a substantial amount of work to implement each one.In this paper, we formalize the shopping models which representthese different modes of consumer to merchant interaction.In addition to developing the overall architecture, wedefine the application program interfaces (API) to interactwith the models. We show how a small number of primitivescan be used to construct a wide range of shopping modelsthat a digital library can support, and provide examples ofthe shopping models in operation, demonstrating their flexibility.Two models have been implemented as part of theStanford Digital Library Project, validating re-usability ofk...

But Web datasources also consist of stand-alone HTML pages hand-codedby individuals, that provide very useful information such asreviews, digests, links, etc. As for the information that alsoexists in underlying databases, the HTML interface is oftenthe only one available for many would-be clients.1.1 A need for HTML wrappersAs soon as we want to go beyond the basic mode of a browsing human, for example to achieve Web-awareness amongservices (services taking advantage of one another) orinteroperability(between Web sources and legacy databases oramong Web sources themselves), we need software applications

Title: Schema Discovery for Semistructured Data
Abstract: To formulate a meaningful query on semistructureddata, such on the Web, that matches someof the source's structure, we need first to discoversomething about how the information is representedin the source. This is referred to as schemadiscovery and was considered for a single objectrecently. In the case of multiple objects, the taskof schema discovery is to identify typical structuringinformation of those objects as a whole.We motivate the schema discovery in this generalsetting and propose a framework and algorithmfor it. We apply the framework to a realWeb database, the Internet Movies Database, todiscover typical schema of most voted movies.IntroductionAs the amount of data available on-line grows rapidly,we find that more and more of the data is semistructured.In the semistructured world, data has no absoluteschema fixed in advance, and the structure of datamay be irregular or incomplete.

Selection is based on statistics extractedfrom the results of probe queries submitted to each server.We evaluate published selection methods and a new methodfor enhancing selection based on expected search servereffectiveness.Results show CORI to be the most effective of three publishedselection methods. CORI selection steadily degradeswith fewer probe queries, causing a drop in early precision ofas much as 0#05 (one relevant document out of 20).

Title: Rate-constrained bandwidth smoothing for the delivery of stored video
Abstract: Bandwidth smoothing techniques for the delivery of compressedprerecorded video have been shown effective inremoving the burstiness required for the continuous playback ofstored video. Given a fixed client-side buffer, severalbandwidth smoothing algorithms have been introduced that are provablyoptimal under certain constraints. Thesealgorithms, however, may be too aggressive in the amount of data thatthey prefetch, making it more difficult to supportVCR functions that are required for interactive video-on-demandsystems. In this paper, we introduce a rate-constrainedbandwidth smoothing algorithm for the delivery of stored video that,given a fixed maximum bandwidth rate minimizesboth the smoothing buffer requirement as well as the buffer residencyrequirements. By minimizing the buffer residencytimes, the clients and servers can remain more tightly coupled makingVCR functions easier to support. A comparisonbetween the rate-constrained bandwidth smoothing algorithm and otherbandwidth smoothing algorithms is presented usinga compressed full-length movie.Keywords: bandwidth smoothing, video-on-demand, video retrievaltechniques1

Abstract: Text is a pervasive information type, and many applications requirequerying over text sources in addition to structured data. This paperstudies the problem of query processing in a system that looselyintegrates an extensible database system and a text retrieval system.We focus on a class of conjunctive queries that include joins betweentext and structured data, in addition to selections over these twotypes of data. We adapt techniques from distributed query processingand introduce a novel class of join methods based on probing that isespecially useful for joins with text systems, and we present a costmodel for the various alternative query processing methods.Experimental results confirm the utility of these methods. The spaceof query plans is extended due to the additional techniques, and wedescribe an optimization algorithm for searching this extended space.The techniques we describe in this paper are applicable to othertypes of external data managers loosely integrated ...

Abstract: A database merging technique is a strategy for combining the resultsof multiple independent searches into a single cohesive response.While a variety of techniques have been developed to address a rangeof problem characteristics, our work focuses on environments in whichsearch engines work in isolation. This paper shows that the behaviorof two previously developed isolated techniques is indeed independentof the particular search engines that participate in the search. Twovery different search engines, SMART and TOPIC, were each used toretrieve documents from five subcollections. The relativeeffectiveness of the merged result compared to the effectiveness of acorresponding single collection run is comparable for both engines.The effectiveness of the merged result is improved when both searchengines search the same five subcollections but participate in asingle merging. The improvement is such that this 10-collection mergeis sometimes more effective than the single coll...

Abstract: We have been developing Name-It, a system that associates faces andnames in news videos. First, as the only knowledge source, the systemis given news videos which include image sequences and transcriptsobtained from audio tracks or closed caption texts. The system canthen either infer the name of a given face and output the namecandidates, or can locate the faces in news videos by a name. Toaccomplish this task, the system extracts faces from image sequencesand names from transcripts, both of which might correspond to keypersons in news topics. The proposed system takes full advantage ofadvanced image and natural language processing. The image processingcontributes to the extraction of face sequences which provide richinformation for face-name association. The processing also helps toselect the best frontal view of a face in a face sequence to enhancethe face identification which is required for the processing.

Abstract: Consider a hierarchical network in which each node periodicallyissues a request for an objectdrawn from a fixed set of unit-size objects. Suppose further that thefollowing conditions are satisfied:the frequency with which each node accesses each object is known;each node has a cache of knowncapacity; any cache can be accessed by any node; any request issatisfied by the closest node witha copy of the desired object. In such an environment, it is desirableto fill the available cache spacewith copies of objects in such a way that the average access cost isminimized. We provide both exactand approximate polynomial-time algorithms for this hierarchicalplacement problem. Our exactalgorithm is based on a reduction to min-cost flow, and does notappear to be practical for largeproblem sizes. Thus we are motivated to search for a fasterapproximation algorithm.

The collectorruns on shared-memory parallel computers and requiresminimal mutator/collector synchronization.No special hardware or operating system supportis required.Our concurrent collector derives from sequentialsemi-space copying collectors.

Title: Polymorphic Type Reconstruction for Garbage Collection Without Tags
Abstract: Several papers ([Appel89],[Goldberg91]) have recentlyclaimed that garbage collection can be performedon untagged data in the presence of ML-style type polymorphism.They rely on the ability to reconstruct thetype of any reachable object during garbage collection.The bad news is that this is false -- there can be reachableobjects in the program whose type cannot be determinedby the garbage collector. The good news is that tag-freegarbage collection can be performed anyway -- any objectwhose type cannot be determined by the collector is,in fact, garbage. Such objects can be discarded by thecollector. This is the key result of this paper.We present a type reconstruction algorithm that candetermine the type of any non-garbage object. Unfortunately,the implementation of the tag-free collector for apolymorphically typed language is difficult in ways thatwere not described in the previous papers, and we addresssome implementation issues as well.

Title: Concurrent compacting garbage collection of a persistent heap
Abstract: We describe a replicating garbage collector for a persistentheap. The garbage collector cooperates with a transactionmanager to provide safe and efficient transactional storagemanagement. Clients read and write the heap in primarymemory and can commit or abort their write operations.When write operations are committed they are preserved instable storage and survive system failures. Clients can freelyaccess the heap during garbage collection because the collectorconcurrently builds a compact replica of the heap. A logcaptures client write operations and is used to support boththe transaction manager and the replicating garbage collector.Our implementation is the first to provide concurrent andcompacting garbage collection of a persistent heap. Measurementsshow that concurrent replicating collection producessignificantly shorter pause times than stop-and-copy collection.For small transactions, throughput is limited by the loggingbandwidth of the underlying log manager. The resultssuggest that replicating garbage collection offers a flexibleand efficient way to provide automatic storage managementin transaction systems, object-oriented databases and persistentprogramming environments.

Abstract: Research results show that while LogStructured File Systems (LFS)offer the potential for dramatically improved file systemperformance, the cleaner can seriously degrade performance, by asmuch as 40% in transaction processing workloads [9]. Our goal is toexamine trace data from live file systems and use those to derivesimple heuristics that will permit the cleaner to run withoutinterfering with normal file access. Our results show that trivialheuristics perform very well, allowing 97% of all cleaning on themost heavily loaded system we studied to be done in the background.1.

Since thisrids the system of seeks during writing, the potential performance ofsuch a system is much greater than in the standard Fast File System[4], which must make writes to several different locations on thedisk for common operations such as file creation.

Title: Alias Types for Recursive Data Structures
Abstract: Linear type systems permit programmers to deallocate orexplicitly recycle memory, but they are severly restricted bythe fact that they admit no aliasing. This paper describesa pseudo-linear type system that allows a degree of aliasingand memory reuse as well as the ability to define complexrecursive data structures. Our type system can encodeconventional linear data structures such as linear lists andtrees as well as more sophisticated data structures includingcyclic and doubly-linked lists and trees. In the latter cases,our type system is expressive enough to represent pointeraliasing and yet safely permit destructive operations such asobject deallocation. We demonstrate the flexibility of ourtype system by encoding two common compiler optimizations:destination-passing style and Deutsch-Schorr-Waiteor "link-reversal" traversal algorithms.

Abstract: We present a functional interpretation of classical linearlogic based on the concept of linear continuations.Unlike their non-linear counterparts, such continuationslead to a model of control that does not inherently imposeany particular evaluation strategy. Instead, suchadditional structure is expressed by admitting closelycontrolled copying and discarding of continuations. Wealso emphasize the importance of classicality in obtainingcomputationally appealing categorical models of linearlogic and propose a simple "coreflective subcategory" interpretation of the modality "!".1 IntroductionIn recent years, there has been considerable interestin applications of Girard's Linear Logic (LL) [Gir87]to programming language design and implementation.Over time, various more or less mutated versions of theoriginal system have been proposed, but they all sharethe same basic premise: that assumptions made in thecourse of a formal proof can not necessarily be used anarbitrary n...

Title: Efficient optimistic concurrency control using loosely synchronized clocks
Abstract: This paper describes an efficient optimistic concurrency controlscheme for use in distributed database systems in which objects arecached and manipulated at client machines while persistent storageand transactional support are provided by servers. The schemeprovides both serializability and external consistency for committedtransactions; it uses loosely synchronized clocks to achieve globalserialization. It stores only a single version of each object, andavoids maintaining any concurrency control information on a perobjectbasis; instead, it tracks recent invalidations on a per-client basis,an approach that has low in-memory space overhead and no per-objectdisk overhead. In addition to its low space overheads, the schemealso performs well. The paper presents a simulation study thatcompares the scheme to adaptive callback locking, the bestconcurrency control scheme for client-server object-oriented databasesystems studied to date. The study shows that our schemeoutperforms...

Title: A Binding Protocol for Distributed Shared Objects
Abstract: This paper specifies a general binding protocol that supports theneeds stated&lt;E-371&gt;above. It is designed to support late binding and language- orapplicationspecific&lt;E-345&gt;policies. It is conceptually simple (it consists of two local methodcalls&lt;E-379&gt;and a single RPC) but recursive. An actual implementation mayterminate&lt;E-355&gt;the recursion at any point, trading off performance and simplicityagainst&lt;E-366&gt;completeness. The examples will show that in most common cases, nomore&lt;E-376&gt;than a single RPC is needed (no recursion).&lt;E-196&gt;An outline of the protocol is as follows (a more detailedpresentation comes&lt;E-370&gt;in Section 5).Theunboundreferencetargetssomeremoteatomofthereferenced&lt;E-111&gt;object; binding produces a local proxy for the object (for instance,a stub or a&lt;E-393&gt;cache) that in turn connects to a further atom (respectively, aremote server or&lt;E-388&gt;some on-disk data). Binding invokes method accept-bind of the initialtarget,&lt;E-370&gt;which type-checks the binding and the remote interface, and returnswhat is&lt;E-391&gt;needed to create the proxy and its connection, possibly redirectingit to another&lt;E-364&gt;atom. On the client side, instantiation method new is upcalled withthe&lt;E-384&gt;information returned by the target. This type-checks the localinterface and&lt;E-381&gt;returns the proxy, instantiated with its connection. As aside-effect, code for&lt;E-385&gt;the proxy may be dynamically linked.&lt;E-190&gt;An important goal of distributed system design is transparency, e.g.,the&lt;E-384&gt;target of a reference being accessed independently of its location.From the perspective&lt;E-380&gt;of an object's client, transparency is a good thing.

Title: Closing the Window of Vulnerability in Multiphase Memory Transactions
Abstract: Multiprocessor architects have begun to explore several mechanismssuch as prefetching,context-switching and software-assisted dynamic cache-coherence,which transformsingle-phase memory transactions in conventional memory systems intomultiphaseoperations. Multiphase operations introduce a window of vulnerabilityin whichdata can be invalidated before it is used. Losing data due toinvalidations introducesdamaging livelock situations.

Title: A High-Throughput Secure Reliable Multicast Protocol
Abstract: A (secure) reliable multicast protocol enables a process to multicasta message to a group of processesin a way that ensures that all honest destination-group membersreceive the same message,even if some group members and the multicast initiator aremaliciously faulty. Reliable multicasthas been shown to be useful for building multiparty cryptographicprotocols and secure distributedservices. We present a high-throughput reliable multicast protocolthat tolerates the malicious behaviorof up to fewer than one-third of the group members. Our protocolachieves high-throughputusing a novel technique for chaining multicasts, whereby the cost ofensuring agreement on eachmulticast message is amortized over many multicasts. This is coupledwith a novel flow-controlmechanism that yields low multicast latency.1.

Title: Evolving Turing-Complete Programs for a Register Machine with Self-modifying Code
Abstract: The majority of commercial computers today are register machines ofvon Neumann type. We have developed a method to evolveTuring-complete programs for a register machine. The describedimplementation enables the use of most program constructs, such asarithmetic operators, large indexed memory, automatic decompositioninto subfunctions and subroutines (ADFs), conditional constructs i.e.if-then-else, jumps, loop structures, recursion, protected functions,string and list functions. Any C-function can be compiled and linkedinto the function set of the system. The use of register machinelanguage allows us to work at the lowest level of binary machine codewithout any interpreting steps. In a von Neumann machine, programsand data reside in the same memory and the genetic operators can thusdirectly manipulate the binary machine code in memory. The geneticoperators themselves are written in C-language but they modifyindividuals in binary representation. The result is an executionspe...

Title: Garbage Collection and Local Variable Type-Precision and Liveness in Java Virtual Machines
Abstract: . Full precision in garbage collection implies retainingonly those heap allocated objects that will actually be used in thefuture.Since full precision is not computable in general, garbage collectorsuse safe (i.e., conservative) approximations such as reachabilityfrom a set of root references. Ambiguous roots collectors(commonly called "conservative") can be overly conservativebecausethey overestimate the root set, and thereby retain unexpectedlylarge amounts of garbage. We consider two more precise collectionschemes for Java virtual machines (JVMs). One uses a typeanalysis to obtain a type-precise root set (only those variables thatcontain references); the other adds a live variable analysis toreducethe root set to only the live reference variables. Even with the Javaprogramming language's strong typing, it turns out that the JVMspecification has a feature that makes type-precise root setsdifficultto compute. We explain the problem and ways in which it can besolved....

Abstract: Multiversion two-phase locking (MV2PL) has been incorporated in somecommercial transactionprocessing systems to support the serializable execution of queries.A drawback to this algorithmis the potentially high cost that it adds to maintain and accessprior versions of data. In this paper,we present a new multiversion locking algorithm, multiversion querylocking (MVQL), thatreduces the cost of versioning by accepting weaker forms ofconsistency for queries than MV2PL.Nevertheless, queries are guaranteed to see transaction-consistentdata. We present results from adetailed performance study that show that, under a wide range ofconditions, MVQL provides higherthroughput to queries and update transactions with a lower storagecost than MV2PL. In the worstcase, the performance of MVQL approaches that of MV2PL.1.

Title: Person Counting Using Stereo
Abstract: For the problem of tracking vehicles on freeways using machinevision, existing systems work well in free-flowingtraffic. Traffic engineers, however, are more interested inmonitoring freeways when there is congestion, and currentsystems break down for congested traffic due to theproblem of partial occlusion. We are developing a featurebasedtracking approach for the task of tracking vehiclesunder congestion. Instead of tracking entire vehicles, vehiclesub-features are tracked to make the system robust topartial occlusion. In order to group together sub-featuresthat come from the same vehicle, the constraint of commonmotion is used. In this paper we describe the system,a real-time implementation using a network of DSP chips,and experiments of the system on approximately 44 lanehours of video data.1 IntroductionTraffic management and information systems must relyon a system of sensors for estimating traffic parameters inreal-time.

Title: Making large-scale support vector machine learning practical
Abstract: Training a support vector machine (SVM) leads to a quadraticoptimization problem with bound constraints and one linear equalityconstraint. Despite the fact that this type of problem is wellunderstood, there are many issues to be considered in designing anSVM learner. In particular, for large learning tasks with manytraining examples, off-the-shelf optimization techniques for generalquadratic programs quickly become intractable in their memory andtime requirements. SVMlight is an implementation of an SVM learnerwhich addresses the problem of large tasks. This chapter presentsalgorithmic and computational results developed for SVMlight V2.0,which make large-scale SVM training more practical.

Abstract: Selecting a set of features which is optimal for a given task is aproblem which plays an important role in a wide variety of contextsincluding pattern recognition, adaptive control, and machinelearning.

Title: Pedestrian detection using wavelet templates
Abstract: This paper presents a trainable object detection architecturethat is applied to detecting people in staticimages of cluttered scenes. This problem poses severalchallenges. People are highly non-rigid objects with ahigh degree of variability in size, shape, color, and texture.Unlike previous approaches, this system learnsfrom examples and does not rely on any a priori (handcrafted)models or on motion.The detection technique is based on the novel ideaof the wavelet template that defines the shape of anobject in terms of a subset of the wavelet coefficientsof the image. It is invariant to changes in color andtexture and can be used to robustly define a rich andcomplex class of objects such as people. We show howthe invariant properties and computational efficiencyof the wavelet template make it an effective tool forobject detection.1 IntroductionThe problem of object detection has seen a high degreeof interest over the years.

Abstract: This article proposes a general theory and methodology, called theminimax entropyprinciple, for building statistical models for images (or signals) ina variety of applications.This principle consists of two parts. The first is the maximumentropy principle for featurebinding (or fusion): for a certain set of feature statistics, adistribution can be built tobind these feature statistics together by maximizing the entropy overall distributions thatreproduce these feature statistics. The second part is the minimumentropy principle forfeature selection: among all plausible sets of feature statistics, wechoose the set whosemaximum entropy distribution has the minimum entropy. Computationaland inferentialissues in both parts are addressed, in particular, a feature pursuitprocedure is proposedfor approximately selecting the optimal set of features. The modelcomplexity is restrictedbecause of the sample variation in the observed feature statistics.The minimax entropyprinci...

Furthermore, general but efficientalgorithms can used for combining information sources in actualrecognizers and for optimizing their application.

We also address this problem when distances aremeasured by the L 1 norm,and in the Hamming cube. Significantly improving and extending recentresults of Kleinberg,we construct data structures whose size is polynomial in the size ofthe database, and searchalgorithms that run in time nearly linear or nearly quadratic in thedimension (depending onthe case; the extra factors are polylogarithmic in the size of thedatabase).

One way of producing such structuraldocumentation for existing software systems is to use reverseengineering technologies.

Abstract: A real-time system is described for automaticallydetecting, modeling and tracking faces in 3D. A closedloop approach is proposed which utilizes structure frommotion to generate a 3D model of a face and then feedback the estimated structure to constrain feature trackingin the next frame. The system initializes by usingskin classification, symmetry operations, 3D warpingand eigenfaces to find a face. Feature trajectoriesare then computed by SSD or correlation-based tracking.The trajectories are simultaneously processed byan extended Kalman filter to stably recover 3D structure,camera geometry and facial pose. Adaptivelyweighted estimation is used in this filter by modelingthe noise characteristics of the 2D image patch trackingtechnique. In addition, the structural estimate is constrainedby using parametrized models of facial structure(eigen-heads). The Kalman filter's estimate of the3D state and motion of the face predicts the trajectoryof the features which constrains...

Abstract: A very promising idea for fast searching in traditional andmultimedia databases is to map objects into points in k-dspace, using k feature-extraction functions, provided by adomain expert [25]. Thus, we can subsequently use highlyfine-tuned spatial access methods (SAMs), to answer severaltypes of queries, including the `Query By Example' type(which translates to a range query); the `all pairs' query(which translates to a spatial join [8]); the nearest-neighboror best-match query, etc.However, designing feature extraction functions can behard. It is relatively easier for a domain expert to assess thesimilarity/distance of two objects. Given only the distanceinformation though, it is not obvious how to map objectsinto points.This is exactly the topic of this paper. We describe a fastalgorithm to map objects into points in some k-dimensionalspace (k is user-defined), such that the dis-similarities arepreserved. There are two benefits from this mapping: (a)efficient ret...

The proofs make useof a viewpoint that is apparently novel in the field of statisticallearningtheory. The hypothesis class is described in terms of a linearoperatormapping from a possibly infinite dimensional unit ball in featurespaceinto a finite dimensional space. The covering numbers of the classarethen determined via the entropy numbers of the operator. Thesenumbers,which characterize the degree of compactness of the operator, canbe bounded in terms of the eigenvalues of an integral operatorinduced bythe kernel function used by the machine. As a consequence we are ableto theoretically explain the effect of the choice of kernel functionon thegeneralization performance of support vector machines.Index terms: ffl-entropy, covering numbers, statistical learningtheory,support vect...

Abstract: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a universallearning machine whose decision surfaceis parameterized by a set of support vectors,and by a set of corresponding weights.An SVM is also characterized by a kernelfunction. Choice of the kernel determineswhether the resulting SVM is a polynomialclassifier, a two-layer neural network, a radialbasis function machine, or some otherlearning machine.SVMs are currently considerably slower intest phase than other approaches with similargeneralization performance. To addressthis, we present a general method to significantlydecrease the complexity of the decisionrule obtained using an SVM. The proposedmethod computes an approximationto the decision rule in terms of a reducedset of vectors. These reduced set vectorsare not support vectors and can in somecases be computed analytically. We give experimentalresults for three pattern recognitionproblems. The results show that themethod can decrease the computational complexityof th...

We assume that we have measurements of the transmissiontimes of a group of packets sent from an originating host, A,and a corresponding set of measurements of their arrival times attheir destination host, B, recorded by two separate clocks. We alsoassume that we have a similar series of measurements of packetssent from B to A (as might occur when recording a TCP connection), but we do not assume that the clock at A is synchronized withthe clock at B, nor that they run at the same frequency. We developrobust algorithms for detecting abrupt adjustments to either clock,and for estimating the relative skew between the clocks. By analyzinga large set of measurements of Internet TCP connections, wefind that both clock adjustments and relative skew are sufficientlycommon that failing to detect them can lead to potentially largeerrors when ...

Abstract: This paper summarizes the results of the BARWAN project, whichfocused on enabling truly useful mobile networking across anextremely wide variety of real-world networks and mobile devices. Wepresent the overall architecture, summarize key results, and discussfour broad lessons learned along the way. The architecture enablesseamless roaming in a single logical overlay network composed of manyheterogeneous (mostly wireless) physical networks, and providessignificantly better TCP performance for these networks. It alsoprovides complex scalable and highly available services to enablepowerful capabilities across a very wide range of mobile devices, andmechanisms for automated discovery and configuration of localizedservices. Four broad themes arose from the project: 1) the power ofdynamic adaptation as a generic solution to heterogeneity, 2) theimportance of cross-layer information, such as the exploitation ofTCP semantics in the link layer, 3) the use of agents in theinfrastructure to enable new abilities and to hide new problems fromlegacy servers and protocol stacks, and 4) the importance of softstate for such agents for simplicity, ease of fault recovery, andscalability.

Title: Active network vision and reality: lessions form a capsule-based system
Abstract: Although active networks have generated much debate in theresearch community, on the whole there has been little hardevidence to inform this debate. This paper aims to redressthe situation by reporting what we have learned by designing,implementing and using the ANTS active network toolkitover the past two years. At this early stage, active networksremain an open research area. However, we believe that wehave made substantial progress towards providing a moreflexible network layer while at the same time addressing theperformance and security concerns raised by the presenceof mobile code in the network. In this paper, we argue ourprogress towards the original vision and the difficulties thatwe have not yet resolved in three areas that characterize a"pure" active network: the capsule model ofprogrammability;the accessibility of that model to all users; and theapplications that can be constructed in practice.1 IntroductionActive networks are a novel approach to network...

Title: Competitive routing in multiuser communication networks
Abstract: We consider a communication network shared by several selfish users.Each userseeks to optimize its own performance by controlling the routing ofits given flow demand,giving rise to a non-cooperative game. We investigate the Nashequilibrium ofsuch systems. For a two-node multiple-links system, uniqueness of theNash equilibriumis proved under reasonable convexity conditions. It is shown thatthis Nash equilibriumpoint possesses interesting monotonicity properties. For generalnetworks, these convexityconditions are not sufficient for guaranteeing uniqueness, and acounter exampleis presented. Nonetheless, uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium forgeneral topologies isestablished under various assumptions.

Title: Issues with multicast video distribution in heterogeneous packet networks
Abstract: ve have limitations. In the first case, thevideo delivered to some of participants will be oflow quality (since packet losses and/or delays willbe high on some branches of the tree). The secondcase is safest, but it results in disturbing thebulk of the participants.In practice, it is not clear how to choose an adequatevalue for this fraction. In IVS, we set thefraction to a few percent [2, 3]. Ideally, however,the source should be able to single out the partsof the multicast tree that experience congestion.In order not to disturb the bulk of participants inthe tree, these branches should be treated separately.Two possible solutions include video gateways,and using some form of layered coding.Video gateways or layered coding schemes arenot new ideas. Our contribution is to identifyand discuss the issues associated with using thesetechniques in the Internet. We illustrate ourpoints with the H.261[10] software coder of IVS.2 Vide

Title: TCP Extensions for Space Communications
Abstract: The space communication environment and mobile and wirelesscommunication environments show many similarities when observedfrom the perspective of a transport protocol. Both types ofenvironments exhibit loss caused by data corruption and linkoutage, in addition to congestion-related loss. The constraintsimposed by the two environments are also similar --- power,weight, and physical volume of equipment are scarce resources.Finally, it is not uncommon for communication channel data ratesto be severely limited and highly asymmetric. We are working onsolutions to these types of problems for space communicationenvironments, and we believe that these solutions may be applicableto the mobile and wireless community. As part of our work,we have defined and implemented the Space CommunicationsProtocol Standards-Transport Protocol (SCPS-TP), a set of extensionsto TCP that address the problems that we have identified.The results of our performance tests, both in the laboratory andon...

Abstract: The specifications and performance of RAMP, a Reliable AdaptiveMulticast Protocol, are presented.Initially described in IETF RFC 1458 [1], RAMP has been enhanced foruse over an all-optical,circuit-switched, gigabit network under our ARPA-sponsored Testbedfor Optical NEtworking(TBONE) project. RAMP uses immediate, receiver-initiated, NAK-basederror notification combinedwith originator-based unicast retransmission. The approach ismotivated by the loss characteristics of theTBONE network, where extremely low bit-error rates (10e-12 or better)and circuit switching makepacket losses almost entirely a result of receiver buffer overflows.Hence, multicast retransmissionwould hinder performance through unnecessary receiver processing ofredundant packets, and delayedNAKs would increase both latency and the likelihood of bufferoverflow.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a bottom-up clustering algorithm based onrecursive collapsing of small cliques in a graph. The sizes of thesmall cliques are derived using random graph theory. This clusteringalgorithm leads to a natural parallel implementation in whichmultiple processors are used to identify clusters simultaneously. Wealso present a cluster-based partitioning method in which ourclustering algorithm is used as a preprocessing step to both thebisection algorithm by Fiduccia and Mattheyses and a ratio-cutalgorithm by Wei and Cheng. Our results show that cluster-basedpartitioning obtains cut sizes up to 49.6% smaller than the bisectionalgorithm, and obtains ratio cut sizes up to 66.8% smaller than theratio-cut algorithm. Moreover, we show that cluster-basedpartitioning produces much stabler results than direct partitioning.

Furthermore, with worst and average case complexity analysis andempirical tests, we demonstrate that efficient and well-behavedapproximation algorithms are applicable for optimizing plans withlarge sizes.

Title: Person Counting Using Stereo
Abstract: For the problem of tracking vehicles on freeways using machinevision, existing systems work well in free-flowingtraffic. Traffic engineers, however, are more interested inmonitoring freeways when there is congestion, and currentsystems break down for congested traffic due to theproblem of partial occlusion. We are developing a featurebasedtracking approach for the task of tracking vehiclesunder congestion. Instead of tracking entire vehicles, vehiclesub-features are tracked to make the system robust topartial occlusion. In order to group together sub-featuresthat come from the same vehicle, the constraint of commonmotion is used. In this paper we describe the system,a real-time implementation using a network of DSP chips,and experiments of the system on approximately 44 lanehours of video data.1 IntroductionTraffic management and information systems must relyon a system of sensors for estimating traffic parameters inreal-time.

Title: Randomized kinodynamic planning
Abstract: This paper presents a state-space perspective on the kinodynamicplanning problem, and introduces a randomized path planning techniquethat computes collision-free kinodynamic trajectories for highdegreeof -freedom problems. By using a state space formulation, thekinodynamic planning problem is treated as a 2n-dimensionalnonholonomic planning problem, derived from an n-dimensional conguration space. The state space serves the same role as the conguration space for basic path planning; however, standard randomizedpath planning techniques do not directly apply to planningtrajectories in the state space. We have developed a randomizedplanning approach that is particularly tailored to kinodynamicproblems in state spaces, although it also applies to standardnonholonomic and holonomic planning problems. The basis for thisapproach is the construction of a tree that attempts to rapidly anduniformly explore the state space, o ering bene ts that are similarto those obtained by succ...

Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm that reduces the cost of regressiontesting by reducing the number of test cases that must be re-run andby reducing the size of the program that they must be run on. Thealgorithm uses dependence graphs and program slicing to partition thecomponents of the new program into two sets: preservedpoints---components that have unchanged run-time behavior; andaffected points---components that have changed run-time behavior.Only test cases that test the behavior of affected points must bere-run; the behavior of the preserved points is guaranteed to be thesame in the old and new versions of the program. Furthermore, thealgorithm produces a program differences, which captures the behaviorof (only) the affected points. Thus, rather than re-testing the(large) new program on a large number of test cases, it is possibleto certify the new program by running the (smaller) programdifferences on a (smaller) number of test cases.

Title: Computability at the Planck Scale
Abstract: We consider the issue of computability at the most fundamental level of physical reality: the Planck scale. To this aim, we consider the theoretical model of a quantum computer on a non commutative space background, which is a computational model for quantum gravity. In this domain, all computable functions are the laws of physics in their most primordial form, and non computable mathematics finds no room in the physical world. Moreover, we show that a theorem that classically was considered true but non computable, at the Planck scale becomes computable but non decidable. This fact is due to the change of logic for observers in a quantumcomputing universe: from standard quantum logic and classical logic, to paraconsistent logic. A quantum computer [24] can simulate [13] perfectly and efficiently a quantum mechanical system. Precision is due to discreteness from both sides: qubits in the quantum register, and discrete spectra in the quantum system. Efficiency is due to quantum parallelism in the quantum computer. However, there is not an isomorphism between the quantum computer and the quantum system, because the latter lies on a classical background (classical space-time, which is a smooth manifold). The classical background is not taken into account during the simulation, but only at the end, when a classical output is obtained by measurement. Because of that, a great deal of quantum information remains hidden. The hidden quantum information is due to the irreversibility of a standard quantum measurement, but this is related to the situation of the external observer in a classical background, which cannot be put in one-to-one correspondence with the machine computational state. One might argue, then, that in a discrete space-time like a lattice, one could overcome this problem. However, we wish to recover the hidden information in a physical discrete space-time, that is, both discrete and Lorentz invariant. And, obviously, a lattice breaks Lorentz invariance. The simplest way out is to consider a quantum space background like a fuzzy sphere [23], which is both discrete and Lorentz invariant. This choice arises quite naturally. In fact, in a recent paper [36], we showed that the non commutative algebra of quantum logic

Title: Essay: Construction Theory, Self-Replication, and the Halting Problem
Abstract: This essay aims to propose construction theory, a new domain of theoretical research on machine construction, and use it to shed light on a fundamental relationship between living and computational systems. Specifically, we argue that self-replication of von Neumanns universal constructors holds a close similarity to circular computational processes of universal computers that appear in Turings original proof of the undecidability of the halting problem. The result indicates the possibility of reinterpreting a self-replicating biological organism as embodying an attempt to solve the halting problem for a diagonal input in the context of construction. This attempt will never be completed because of the indefinite cascade of self-computation/construction, which accounts for the undecidability of the halting problem and also agrees well with the fact that life has maintained its reproductive activity for an indefinitely long period of time.

The four additional theories that it draws upon are utility theory (how important are the values?), decision theory (how do stakeholders  values determine decisions?), dependency theory (how do dependencies affect value realization?), and control theory (how to adapt to change and control value realization?). After discussing the motivation and context for developing a VBSE theory and the criteria for a good theory, the chapter discusses how the theories work together into a process for defining, developing, and evolving software-intensive systems. It also illustrates the application of the theory to a supply chain system example, discusses how well the theory meets the criteria for a good theory, and identifies an agenda for further research.

Title: Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems
Abstract: There are quite a few solutions for crew scheduling, including some commercial applications. The same happens for aircraft scheduling and for flight scheduling including revenue management. However, the airline operations problem did not receive the same attention has the other airline scheduling problems. Some companies like Carmen Systems AB and The Sabre Group have research teams dedicated to this topic. In this paper Im proposing the development of a Distributed Multi-agent System that will be capable of dealing with the crew and aircraft recovery problem, during the airline operations phase. The MAS will be able to deal with different operational bases and all bases will cooperate to find the solutions to the local problems. Robustness will be a key feature and I will try to achieve that through redundancy in finding the possible solutions to the problem. To be an Intelligent System  some kind of learning must be available. Ill use learning to define the crew members profile, to learn the use of stand by crew members and include this learning in future crew scheduling and in suggesting new solutions based on previous decisions. Finally, I would like to explore the possibility of having a kind of electronic market  for available crew members/aircrafts among airline companies, to be used in crew and aircraft recovery.

Title: A reinforcement learning scheme for a partially-observable multi-agent game
Abstract: We formulate an automatic strategy acquisition problem for the multi-agent card game Hearts  as a reinforcement learning problem. The problem can approximately be dealt with in the framework of a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) for a singleagent system. Hearts is an example of imperfect information games, which are more difficult to deal with than perfect information games. A POMDP is a decision problem that includes a process for estimating unobservable state variables. By regarding missing information as unobservable state variables, an imperfect information game can be formulated as a POMDP. However, the game of Hearts is a realistic problem that has a huge number of possible states, even when it is approximated as a single-agent system. Therefore, further approximation is necessary to make the strategy acquisition problem tractable. This article presents an approximation method based on estimating unobservable state variables and predicting the actions of the other agents. Simulation results show that our reinforcement learning method is applicable to such a difficult multi-agent problem.

Title: Abstract Designing for augmented attention: Towards a framework for attentive user interfaces
Abstract: Attentive user interfaces are user interfaces that aim to support the users attentional capacities. By sensing the users  attention for objects and people in their everyday environment, and by treating user attention as a limited resource, these interfaces avoid todays ubiquitous patterns of interruption. Focusing upon attention as a central interaction channel allows development of more sociable methods of communication and repair with ubiquitous devices. Our methods are analogous to human turn taking in group communication. Turn taking improves the users ability to conduct foreground processing of conversations. Attentive user interfaces bridge the gap between the foreground and periphery of user activity in a similar fashion, allowing users to move smoothly in between. We present a framework for augmenting user attention through attentive user interfaces. We propose five key properties of attentive systems: (i) to sense attention; (ii) to reason about attention; (iii) to regulate interactions; (iv) to communicate attention and (v) to augment attention.

Title: Where You Point is Where the Robot is
Abstract: It is virtually envisioned that in the near future home-service robots will be assisting people in their daily lives. While a wide spectrum of utility of home-service robots has been proposed, i.e., cleaning, surveillance or go-and-fetch jobs, usability studies of the home-service robots have been less undertaken. This paper explores the usability issues, in particular, a map-based user interface for instructing home-service robots in the home environment. It focused on how the different map representation of the co-located environment would affect task performance of locating the home-service robots. The effectiveness of the mapbased human-robot interface was thus analysed according to the dimensionality of the map, the location information of the elements in the co-located workspace. The experimental results showed that task performance was varied by the different map representation, providing a better understanding of what characteristics of the map representation were able to effectively support the human operator in instructing the home-service robots in the home environment.

Abstract: This paper examines the use of motorized physical sliders with position and force as input and output parameters for tangible human computer interaction. Firstly, we present an analogue platform. It was used to realize two proof-ofconcept applications: one for learning system dynamics as part of physics education and the second for interaction with music loops. Based on the insight gained with the analogue platform and the two applications, we took the first steps towards a digital platform, also presented here. More generally, the paper presents socalled haptic modes, which may be generated using force feedback control of motorized sliders. The paper also briefly presents parts of the underlying software and hardware which was designed and realized as part of this project.

Title: The Reality of the Semantic Gap in Image Retrieval
Abstract: The semantic gap is referred to frequently in papers on image retrieval or multimedia information handling. However, whilst many authors have been happy to make reference to it, few have attempted to characterize the gap in any detail. This tutorial will attempt to rectify this situation by characterizing the semantic gap in image retrieval rather more specifically than hitherto. It will summarise current attempts to begin to bridge the gap both through developments in content-based techniques, the application of semantic web and knowledge technologies and recent progress in auto image annotation. The tutorial will consist of presentations/demonstrations partly based on research in recent European and UK projects, and particularly on a project to investigate the semantic gap funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council in the UK involving the four presenters. This tutorial aims to provide valuable insights for those involved in research and development on image or multimedia retrieval and who wish to understand and address the concerns of real end-users and exploit recent research results in the field. In particular, the tutorial will provide practical insights into the problems associated with bridging the communication gap between the computer science/vision research community and the image management/practitioner community. The first presentation will summarise research into the way picture searchers articulate real queries, how they

Title: Abstract Testing the cluster hypothesis in distributed information retrieval
Abstract: How to merge and organise query results retrieved from different resources is one of the key issues in distributed information retrieval. Some previous research and experiments suggest that cluster-based document browsing is more effective than a single merged list. Cluster-based retrieval results presentation is based on the cluster hypothesis, which states that documents that cluster together have a similar relevance to a given query. However, while this hypothesis has been demonstrated to hold in classical information retrieval environments, it has never been fully tested in heterogeneous distributed information retrieval environments. Heterogeneous document representations, the presence of document duplicates, and disparate qualities of retrieval results, are major features of an heterogeneous distributed information retrieval environment that might disrupt the effectiveness of the cluster hypothesis. In this paper we report on an experimental investigation into the validity and effectiveness of the cluster hypothesis in highly heterogeneous distributed information retrieval environments. The results show that although clustering is affected by different retrieval results representations and quality, the cluster hypothesis still holds and that generating hierarchical clusters in highly heterogeneous distributed information retrieval environments is still a very effective way of presenting retrieval results to users.

Title: Automatic Age Estimation Based on Facial Aging Patterns
Abstract: While recognition of most facial variations, such as identity, expression and gender, has been exten-sively studied, automatic age estimation has rarely been explored. In contrast to other facial variations, aging variation presents several unique characteristics which make age estimation a challenging task. This paper proposes an automatic age estimation method named AGES (AGing pattErn Subspace). The basic idea is to model the aging pattern, which is defined as the sequence of a particular individuals face images sorted in time order, by constructing a representative subspace. The proper aging pattern for a previously unseen face image is determined by the projection in the subspace that can reconstruct the face image with minimum reconstruction error, while the position of the face image in that aging pattern will then indicate its age. In the experiments, AGES and its variants are compared with the limited existing age estimation methods (WAS and AAS) and some well-established classification methods (kNN, BP, C4.5, and SVM). Moreover, a comparison with human perception ability on age is conducted. It is interesting to note that the performance of AGES is not only significantly better than that of all the other algorithms, but also comparable to that of the human observers.

Title: On the Flexibility of Theoretical Models for Pattern Recognition
Abstract: This thesis is devoted to relaxing certain theoretical assumptions in pattern recognition models. In pattern recognition a predictor is trying to guess a discrete label of some object (usually a real vector), based on given examples of object-label pairs. Pattern recognition was developed to serve a growing number of practi-cal applications; many of these applications still do not fit any theoretical model. The aim of this work is to make existing learning algorithms justifi-ably applicable to a wider range of practical tasks, by proving that certain theoretical assumptions can be relaxed without significant loss in perfor-mance. The first assumption this work aims to relax is that examples are in-dependent and identically distributed (i.i.d.); this condition is traditionally imposed in the majority of works on pattern recognition, but is often vio-lated in applications. It turns out that many results of pattern recognition

Title: XML Based Network Topology Description Idea Paper
Abstract: In todays world governments, public and private institutions depend heavily on their networked computer systems for the delivery of their services and products. Networked computer systems required a wide variety of management tasks that have been formalized in management frameworks. Arguably the most successful management framework is the Internet management framework, also called SNMP management. Despite its success, there is a common understanding that the Internet management framework will be unable to resolve the current and future Internet management needs. In particular SNMP provides poor support for configuration management (e.g.; download and upload of complete configurations files, support for multiple configuration files, download and upload of configuration file deltas). XML based network management has emerged as both an alternative and a complementary technology of SNMP. We proposed the creation of an XML based Network Topology Description. An XML based Network Topology Description will allow for simplified, automated checking of network device configuration, the creation of XML based network topology databases, and simplified, automated generation of network device configuration.

Title: The network oracle
Abstract: This paper sets out a high-level research agenda aimed at building a collaborative, global end-system monitoring and information infrastructure for the Internets core state. We argue that such a system is beneficial, feasible and timely, representing an important area for engagement across database and networking technologies. We start by hypothesizing the benefits to the Internet of a Network Oracle  that could answer real-time questions about the global state of the network. We then argue that database and networking technology should make it possible to provide a useful approximation of such an oracle today, gathering information from a large number of end hosts and delivering useful views to each end system. We further argue that this can and should be done in a decentralized fashion. We provide an outline of such a system: it employs sensing agents, along with a distributed query/trigger/dissemination engine, and possible attractive end-user applications. A key point of our discussion is the timeliness and importance of a grassroots agenda for Internet monitoring and state-sharing. While significant social and economic barriers to deploying a centralized, public Internet monitoring infrastructure exist, there are corresponding social and economic incentives for a collaborative approach. 1

Title: A new way of estimating compute boundedness and its application to dynamic voltage scaling
Abstract: : Many recent dynamic voltage-scaling (DVS) algorithms use hardware events (such as cache misses, memory bus transactions, or instruction execution rates) as the basis for deciding how much a program region can be slowed down with acceptable performance loss. Although these approaches result in power savings, the hardware events measured are at best indirectly related to execution time and clock frequency. We propose a new metric for evaluating the performance loss caused by DVS, a metric that is logically related to clock frequency and execution time, namely the percentage drop in cycles. Further, we show that we can predict with high accuracy the execution time of a code region at any clock frequency after measuring the total number of cycles spent in that region for two clock frequenciesthe maximum and the second highest clock frequency. Measurements using several real-world applications show that this two-point  model predicts execution times with an accuracy that is greater than 95 % in many cases. This result can be used to develop low-overhead DVS algorithms that are more system-aware than many of the current algorithms, which

Title: Isla Vista Heap Sizing: Using Feedback to Avoid Paging
Abstract: Managed runtime environments (MREs) employ garbage collection (GC) for automatic memory management. However, GC induces pressure on the virtual memory (VM) manager, since it may touch pages that are not related to the working set of the application. Paging due to GC can significantly hurt performance, even when the applications working set fits into physical memory. We present a feedback-directed heap resizing mechanism to avoid GC-induced paging, using information from the operating system (OS). We avoid costly GCs when there is physical memory available, and trade off GC for paging when memory is constrained Our mechanism is simple and uses allocation stall events during GC alone to trigger heap resizing, without user participation or OS kernel modification. Our system enables significant performance improvements when real memory is restricted and similar to, or better performance than, the current state-of-the-art MRE, when memory is unconstrained. 1.

We argue and show that memory reuse and co-location of prolific objects can result in improved cache locality, reduced memory fragmentation, reduced GC time, and faster object allocation. We evaluate STEMA using 16 benchmarks. Experimental results show that STEMA performs 2.7%, 4.0%, and 8.2 % on average better than MarkSweep, CopyMS, and SemiSpace.

The two-tier architecture and the use of the distributed hash table as the routing substrate provides an infrastructure for creating large networks of digital libraries with minimal administration costs.

Title: Is there an Elegant Universal Theory of Prediction? ?
Abstract: Solomonoffs inductive learning model is a powerful, universal and highly elegant theory of sequence prediction. Its critical flaw is that it is incomputable and thus cannot be used in practice. It is sometimes suggested that it may still be useful to help guide the development of very general and powerful theories of prediction which are computable. In this paper it is shown that although powerful algorithms exist, they are necessarily highly complex. This alone makes their theoretical analysis problematic, however it is further shown that beyond a moderate level of complexity the analysis runs into the deeper problem of Godel incompleteness. This limits the power of mathematics to analyse and study prediction algorithms, and indeed intelligent systems in general.

Title: Plausible Neural Networks www.pnntech.com Logic, science and complex systems- a synthesis view
Abstract: There have been many important new developments of mathematical science in the last few decades; among them are fractals/chaos, neural networks, and fuzzy systems. These developments are mostly due to the invention of the computer. With the computer it also exposes its limitation to mimic the brain function. From our current understanding, the brain seemed to take advantage of both analog and digital computations. The brain extracts the pattern in the world. Since we never step over the same river twice; precision becomes an encumbrance, the concept of physical state can be stretched to a field or manifold. These developments assert the viewpoint of Kelly (1955), Our psychological geometry is a geometry of dichotomies rather than the geometry of areas envisioned by the classical logic of concepts, or the geometry of lines envisioned by classical mathematical geometries." A decade ago, I have found a way to unify probability theory and fuzzy set theories into a single framework of statistical inference. In the process I helped to make fuzzy set measurement objective, i.e. the fuzzy set membership can be estimated from data. Recently I have combined neural networks and fuzzy systems, which has shed light onto the mystery of how the brains higher order cognition network is organized and is computed. Now the brains higher order cognition can be linked to lower levels of the perception system, and therefore be understood. Plausible Neural Network (PNN) was developed to demonstrate the propriety of this approach.

Title: The confluent capacity of the internet: congestion vs. dilation
Abstract: Using shortest paths, the Internet scales very poorly with respect to congestion [2]. Two main reasons for using shortest paths are dilation (or delay) and size of routing tables. As the Internet grows, the small size of routing tables is important for scaling, but it does not require shortest paths. As long as the paths are confluent, the routing table size is unchanged. In this paper we study the confluent capacity of the Internet. We use the preferential attachment model [5] for the Internet, and all-pair uniform demand for the traffic pattern. Our main theoretical result is that the confluent congestion 1 is within a logarithmic factor of the optimal splittable congestion and can be achieved using a simple randomized and distributed scheme called Locally Independent Rounding Algorithm (LIRA). We reinforce this result experimentally by employing simulations to demonstrate that for almost all instances the confluent congestion is (nearly) equal to the splittable congestion. Thus we conclude that the Internet scales well using confluent paths. We combine known results on expanders and the expansion properties of the preferential attachment model to show that for almost all Internet-like networks, we can find a confluent flow that simultaneously achieves O(log n)approximate congestion and O(1)-approximate dilation. We confirm, using simulations, the intuition that confluence does not come at the cost of dilation.

Title: Overlays on Wireless Mesh Networks: Implementation and Cross-Layer Searching," presented at
Abstract: . After years of research on ad hoc networks, practical wireless mesh networks are moving towards mainstream industry deployment. As wireless mesh networks become more ubiquitous, how to enable distributed applications and services is a challenging research topic. A new network architecture called OverMesh is recently proposed, in which computational overlays provide the facility to deploy distributed services across mobile mesh nodes. In this paper, we present the first implementation of the OverMesh architecture. The overlays are built over an IEEE 802.11s wireless mesh network pre-standard prototype. The platform enables development and deployment of concurrent distributed experiments on wireless mesh networks. Based on this platform, we further introduce a cross-layer searching algorithm, which combines traditional overlay searching with ad hoc network routing so that a physically short searching route is facilitated. Both experimentation and simulation results are presented.

Title: Adaptive Transaction Scheduling for Transactional Memory Systems
Abstract: Transactional memory systems are expected to enable parallel programming at lower programming complexity, while delivering improved performance over traditional lock-based systems. Nonetheless, we observed that there are situations where transactional memory systems could actually perform worse, and that these situations will actually become dominant in future workloads as more and larger-scale trans-actional memory systems are available. Transactional memory systems can excel locks only when the executing workloads contain sufficient parallelism. When the workload lacks the inherent parallelism, blindly launching excessive transactions can adversely result in performance degradation. To quantita-tively demonstrate the issues, we introduce the concept of effective transactions in this paper. We show that the effectiveness of a transaction is closely related to a dynamic quantity we call contention inten-sity. By limiting the contention intensity below the desired level, we can significantly increase transaction effectiveness. Increased effectiveness directly increases the overall performance of a transactional memory system. Based on our study, we implemented a transaction scheduler which not only guarantees that hard-ware transactional memory systems perform better than locks, but also significantly improves performance for both the hardware and software transactional memory systems.

Abstract: Large-memory high-performance applications such as scientific computing, weather prediction simulations, database management, and graphics rendering applications are increasingly claiming a prominent share of the cluster-based application space. Even though improvements in Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) technology have yielded an enormous increase in the memory capacity of off-theshelf systems, the memory-intensive applications continue to hunger for even larger amounts of memory. The issue is not whether one can provide enough DRAM to satisfy these applications; rather the more DRAM one provides, the more these applications ask for. These large-memory applications quickly hit the physical memory limit and start paging to the local disk. As a consequence, application execution time is degraded due to higher disk latency involved in paging

Abstract: Summary. Agent technology is widely perceived to be a viable solution for largescale industrial and commercial applications in dynamic environments such as the Internet. However, the lack of rigour and language support in the analysis, specification, design and implementation of multi-agent systems has hampered the wide adoption of agent technology. This paper proposes a model-driven approach to the development of multi-agent systems. It combines graphic modelling with formal specification through automated tools. The paper reports an agent-oriented modelling language CAMLE and the automated tools in its modelling environment. Two aspects of particular importance in the model-driven development methodology are addressed in this paper. The first is the definition and implementation of consistency constraints on graphic models. The second is the automated transformation of graphic models into formal specifications.

Abstract: In todays ever-changing world of technology and information, a growing number of organizations and universities seek to store digital documents in an online, accessible manner. These digital library (DL) repositories are powerful systems that allow institutions to store their digital documents while permitting interaction and collaboration among users in their organizations. Despite the continual work on DL systems that can produce out-of-the-box online repositories, the installation, configuration, and customization processes of these systems are still far from straightforward. Motivated by the arduous process of designing digital library instances; installing software packages like DSpace and Greenstone; and configuring, customizing, and populating such systems, we have developed an XML-based model for specifying the nature of DSpace digital libraries. The ability to map out a digital library to be created in a straightforward, XML-based way allows for the integration of such a specification with other DL tools. To make use of DL specifications for DSpace, we create a DL generator that uses these models of digital library systems to create, configure, customize, and populate DLs as specified.

Title: Title Argumentation Based Decision Making for Trust in Multi-Agent Systems
Abstract: Agents in Multi-Agent Systems depend on assistance from others to attain their goals. Often, goals of agents conflict with each other, and agents can be unreliable or deceitful. Therefore, rational agents embedded in an open Multi-Agent System need to be equipped with algorithms to reason about trust. Currently, existing algorithms mainly focus on performance of these algorithms in terms of utility, but do not provide explanation of their actions. This might hinder acceptance of agent-based technologies in sensitive applications where users rely on their personal agents. In this thesis, we therefore propose a new approach to trust in Multi-Agent Systems based on argumentation that aims to expose the rationale behind these decisions. Our solution features a clear separation of opponent modeling and decision making. It uses fuzzy logic to model behavior of opponents, and argumentation to translate these models into wellsupported decisions.

While surfaces of them are genuine / original stones and shells, embedded microcomputers generate responses to humans  physical actions with electronic light and sound. This mechanism consequently can augment relationships between human and natural things, and produce joyful experiences. We believe our concept can open the way to the next-design paradigm and applications with pervasive computing technologies.

Title: Interaction patterns for auditory user interfaces
Abstract: This paper proposes the use of interaction patterns in the design process of auditory displays in human-computer interaction. To avoid introducing visual concepts in auditory design, a common ground for developing user interfaces without determining their means of representation is proposed. This meta domain allows for the design of user interfaces which can be equally realised in different interaction modalities or multi-modal settings. Although this work focuses on the auditory domain the concept shown is developed keeping in mind that it should be equally applicable in other modalities. A set of mode independent interaction patterns for design in the meta domain are introduced along with their transformation into the auditory domain. A real world application was chosen to evaluate the approach. MS Explorer was analysed, described through the mode independent interaction patterns and transformed into the auditory domain making extensive use of 3D audio rendering techniques. The result, a virtual audio reality version of a file manager, was evaluated with normally sighted persons as well as visually impaired and blind participants showing the feasibility and usability of the approach.

Title: Full-text federated search in peer-to-peer networks
Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks integrate autonomous computing resources without requiring a central coordinating authority, which makes them a potentially robust and scalable model for providing federated search capability to large-scale networks of text digital libraries. However, P2P networks have so far mostly used simple search techniques based on document names or controlledvocabulary terms, and provided very limited support for full-text search of document contents. This dissertation provides solutions to full-text federated search with relevance-based document ranking within an integrated framework of P2P network overlay, search, and evolution models. Previous notions of P2P network architectures are extended to define a network overlay model with desired content distribution and navigability. Existing approaches to federated search are adapted, and new methods are developed for resource representation, resource selection, and result merging in a network search model according to the unique characteristics of P2P networks. Furthermore, autonomous and decentralized algorithms to evolve the network topology into one with desired search-enhancing properties are proposed in a network evolution model to facilitate effective and efficient full-text federated search in dynamic environments. To demonstrate that the proposed solutions are both effective and practical, two P2P testbeds consisting of thousands of real-content text digital libraries and hundreds of thousands of automatically generated queries are developed. Evaluation using these testbeds provides strong empirical evidence that the approaches proposed in this dissertation provide a better combination of accuracy, efficiency and robustness than more common alternatives.

Title: On the Fusion of Prosody, Voice Spectrum and Face Features for Multimodal Person Verification
Abstract: 1 Multimodal person recognition systems normally use shortterm spectral features as voice information. In this paper prosodic information is added to a system based on face and voice spectrum features. By using two fusion techniques, support vector machines and matcher weighting, different fusion strategies based on the fusion of monomodal scores in several steps are proposed. The performance of the system is clearly improved when the prosodic information is added and the best results are achieved when prosodic scores are previously fused and the resulting scores are fused again with spectral and facial scores. Speech and face scores have been obtained upon Switchboard-I and XM2VTS databases respectively.

Title: From aardvark to zorro: A benchmark of mammal images
Abstract: Current object recognition systems aim at achieving two challenging goals: recognizing numerous object classes and learning new object classes from a small number of examples. This paper provides a benchmark for evaluating progress on these fundamental tasks. Several methods have recently proposed to utilize the commonalities between object classes in order to effectively acquire new object classes. Such methods can be termed interclass transfer techniques. However, it is currently difficult to asses which of the proposed methods maximally utilizes the shared structure of related classes. To facilitate the development, as well as the assessment of methods for dealing with multiple related classes, the proposed benchmark provides labeled images of over &nbsp;???? mammal classes. The images are organized in five levels of variability, and their labels provide information on the objects identity, location and pose. A labeled benchmark containing a large number of related classes is crucial for assessing how well proposed solutions scale up, and which methods better utilize interclass transfer

Title: Agent Organization and Request Propagation in the Knowledge Plane
Abstract: In designing and building a network like the Internet, we continue to face the problems of scale and distribution. In particular, network management has become an increasingly difficult task, and network applications often need to maintain efficient connectivity graphs for various purposes. The knowledge plane was proposed as a new construct to improve network management and applications. In this proposal, I propose an application-independent mechanism to support the construction of applicationspecific connectivity graphs. Specifically, I propose to build a network knowledge plane and multiple sub-planes for different areas of network services. The network knowledge plane provides valuable knowledge about the Internet to the sub-planes, and each sub-plane constructs its own connectivity graph using network knowledge and knowledge in its own specific area. I focus on two key design issues: (1) a region-based architecture for agent organization; (2) knowledge dissemination and request propagation. Network management and applications benefit from the underlying network knowledge plane and sub-planes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this mechanism, I conduct case studies in network management and security.

Title: VARON: Vehicular Ad hoc Route Optimisation for NEMO q,qq Abstract
Abstract: In this paper, we analyse the provision of enhanced communications between vehicles. It is expected that vehicles will have several communication devices, and that a specialised node will provide external connectivity to these devices, i.e., the devices in the vehicle form a Mobile Network. We propose the use of Network Mobility communication solutions for providing access from the vehicles to an infrastructured network (e.g., the Internet) or for communication with other vehicles. The main contribution of this paper consists in a route optimisation solution for mobile networks  based on the use of mixed ad hoc and infrastructure communications  that enables intervehicle communications to be improved in terms of bandwidth and delay. The mechanism provides the same level of security than todays IPv4 Internet, by means of reusing Mobile IPv6 security concepts, and the use of public key cryptography and Cryptographically Generated Addresses. The proposed solution is characterised and evaluated through extensive simulation, showing that it provides an efficient optimisation in vehicular communications.

Title: Adaptive distributed traffic control service for DDoS attack mitigation
Abstract: Frequency and intensity of Internet attacks are rising with an alarming pace. Several technologies and concepts were proposed for fighting distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks: traceback, pushback, i3, SOS and Mayday. This paper shows that in the case of DDoS reflector attacks they are either ineffective or even counterproductive. We then propose a novel concept and system that extends the control over network traffic by network users to the Internet using adaptive traffic processing devices. We safely delegate partial network management capabilities from network operators to network users. All network packets with a source or destination address owned by a network user can now also be controlled within the Internet instead of only at the network users Internet uplink. By limiting the traffic control features and by restricting the realm of control to the owner  of the traffic, we can rule out misuse of this system. Applications of our system are manifold: prevention of source address spoofing, DDoS attack mitigation, distributed firewall-like filtering, new ways of collecting traffic statistics, traceback, distributed network debugging, support for forensic analyses and many more.

Title: Scoped types and aspects for real-time Java
Abstract: . Real-time systems are notoriously difficult to design and implement, and, as many real-time problems are safety-critical, their solutions must be reliable as well as efficient and correct. While higher-level programming models (such as the Real-Time Specification for Java) permit real-time programmers to use language features that most programmers take for granted (objects, type checking, dynamic dispatch, and memory safety) the compromises required for real-time execution, especially concerning memory allocation, can create as many problems as they solve. This paper presents Scoped Types and Aspects for Real-Time Systems (STARS) a novel programming model for real-time systems. Scoped Types give programmers a clear model of their programs  memory use, and, being statically checkable, prevent the run-time memory errors that bedevil models such as RTSJ. Our Aspects build on Scoped Types guarantees so that Real-Time concerns can be completely separated from applications  base code. Adopting the integrated Scoped Types and Aspects approach can significantly improve both the quality and performance of a real-time Java systems, resulting in simpler systems that are reliable, efficient, and correct. 1

Title: Security of memory allocators for C and C++
Abstract: Most memory allocators ignore security issues. Instead they focus on maximizing performance and limiting fragmentation and waste. While these are very important issues for a memory allocator, in the days of worms that use code injection attacks to cause significant economical damage, security can not be ignored. This paper evaluates a representative set of commonly used memory allocators for C and C++ with respect to their resilience against code injection attacks. We present a significant improvement for memory allocators in order to increase robustness against code injection attacks. We evaluate this new approach in terms of performance and memory usage and show that the associated overhead is negligible. CR Subject Classification: K6.5, A.1, D3.4, D4.2 1

Title: Clocking type-2 computation in the unit cost model
Abstract: . In [12] we defined a class of functions called Type-2 Time Bounds (henceforth T2TB) for clocking the Oracle Turing Machine (OTM) in order to capture the long missing notion of complexity classes at type-2. In the present paper we further advance the type-2 complexity theory under our notion of type-2 complexity classes. We have learned that the theory is highly sensitive to how the oracle answers are handled. We present a reasonable alternative called unit cost model, and examine how this model shapes the outlook of the type-2 complexity theory. Under the unit cost model we prove two theorems opposite to the classical union theorem and gap theorem. We also investigate some properties of T2TB including a very useful theorem stating that there is an effective operator to convert any ? ? T2TB into an equivalent one that is locking-detectable. The existence of such operator allows us to simplify many proofs without loss of generality.
