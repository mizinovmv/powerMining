Title: Service discovery in DEAPspace
Abstract: The DEAPspace group at IBM Research, Zurich Lab is developing a  system in which services can be shared between proximate devices.   The target environment is single-hop short-range wireless systems,  and the solution must offer prompt responsiveness for transient  devices.  In this article, the service discovery algorithm is  presented.  Through this new algorithm, a computing device can detect the presence of neighboring devices, share configuration and service information with those devices, and also notice when devices become  unavailable.  Targeted for wireless ad hoc single-hop networks, this  solution improves the responsiveness of devices to changes in their  environments.  The effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated  through comparison with others that achieve similar goals,  considering the responsiveness to changes in the local environment,  power consumption, and bandwidth requirement of devices.  11 Refs.

Title: PiNet: Wireless connectivity for organizational information access  using lightweight handheld devices
Abstract: In order to support connectivity requirements for today's pervasive  devices, a new type of wireless network is needed.  Pervasive  Information Network (PiNet) is a new wireless connectivity  architecture designed to support access to organizational  information using lightweight handheld devices.  PiNet's main  objective is to support a mass-market-type application, where  thousands of users can simultaneously have interactive access to a  variety of organizational information sources while maintaining a  short response time and using a simple, low-cost, power-limited  pervasive device.  This article summarizes the necessary  characteristics of PiNet and presents a survey of the existing main  technologies, explaining how they fall short of providing a total  solution for pervasive wireless networks.  In conclusion, this  document indicates the direction that must be taken in order to  design a solution that will provide a large number of users with a  practical means of obtaining information in a timely manner.  7 Refs.

Title: Bandwidth adaptive smoothing for multimedia delivery
Abstract: Providing a satisfactory multimedia application service In networking environments requires an effective media delivery mechanism.   However, a common network such as Internet does not provide a  guaranteed network bandwidth to accommodate multimedia service in a  reliable fashion.  A typical approach to assist multimedia delivery  is via buffer management In end system.  Buffer management techniques are classified into two categories; one is adapting the changes in  network load and the other is smoothing the bandwidth requirement.   The former may cause a serious loss of service quality and the  latter is not able to adapt to the dynamic network condition.  In  this paper we propose a bandwidth adaptive smoothing which is  adaptive to the dynamic networks and also supports better quality of service by smoothing the bandwidth requirement.  Simulation results  with a prerecorded MPEG video show that the quality of video  delivered IS Improved with the proposed technique.  6 Refs.

Title: Foveation-based error resilience for video transmission over mobile  networks
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a foveation-based error resilience scheme for low bit rate visual communications over highly error-prone  mobile networks.  In order to alleviate the degradation of visual  quality due to signal fading attenuation, it is necessary to develop more robust error resilience schemes.  By maintaining relatively high source throughput for perceptually important regions, the visual  quality degradation can be effectively reduced.  We spatially divide  each frame into foveated and background layers according to  perceptual importance.  Two bitstreams are generated from the layers  and transmitted using an unequal error protection scheme.  In the  simulation, the visual quality is significantly increased up to 3 dB FPSNR (foveal peak signal to noise ratio) at 40% packet error rate.   5 Refs.

Title: Bandwidth management providing guaranteed call dropping rates for  multimedia mobile networks
Abstract: One major concern for the future mobile multimedia networks is how to guarantee various handoff call dropping rates (CDRs) for different  services.  Previous researches proposed bandwidth reservation  schemes, which reduce CDR but may not guarantee CDR.  Bandwidth  efficiency is another important issue due to the scarcity of  wireless bandwidth resources.  In this paper, we address these issues by proposing schemes that combine reservation with dynamic channel  allocation to improve bandwidth efficiency.  Bandwidth reservations  are made based on monitored network parameters.  Priorities are  assigned so that higher priority services may have access to more  reserved channels than lower priority services.  Simulation study  shows that the proposed scheme guarantees predefined CDRs for  different multimedia services while providing high bandwidth  efficiency.  6 Refs.

Title: A fully scalable 3D subband video codec
Abstract: Multimedia transmissions over heterogeneous networks require a high  degree of flexibility from video compression systems.  They are  expected to be fully scalable, that is to say to be able to partly  decode a video bitstream and to get a reconstruction quality  proportional to the received amount of information.  To achieve this  functionality, we propose a video codec based on 2D+t subband  decomposition.  Groups of frames are first temporally filtered using  motion compensation and then spatially decomposed with wavelets.  The spatiotemporal coefficients are further scanned and compressed using a new SPIHT-like strategy, namely Fully Scalable Zerotree coding,  together with arithmetic encoding, which provides a combination of  temporal, spatial and SNR scalability.  In addition, scalable motion  vector coding ensures a fully progressive bitstream.  11 Refs.

Title: Tracking multiple individuals for video communication
Abstract: We propose a new interpretation platform dedicated to video  communication.  Basically, a video communication system takes an  image flow from a camera and broadcasts it in a computer network.   The goal of interpretation is to enable the video communication  system to adapt automatically the broadcasted image flow, using  image filtering, blurring and zooming.  For that we need to detect  and track individuals in office scenes, then to understand their  behavior.  In this article, we focus on a new tracking method based  on a 3D model of the scene, on explicit models of individuals and on the computation of several possible paths for each individual.  The  main issues of the tracking algorithm are presented.  Finally we show the results of our algorithm for several sequences illustrating  office activities in every-day life situations.  9 Refs.

Title: Embedded OSs gain the inside track
Abstract: Embeded operating systems are found in all kinds of devices and  systems, from high-end routers and switches that keep networks  running to medical devices, copiers and factory automation systems.   Open source embeded operating systems (OSs) were released based on  on BSD Unix and Linux.  They are less expensive and users can access  to and customize the source code.  Microsoft built windows CE  embedded with real time features such as nested interrupt support,  but didn't included such elements in Windows NT embedded which works only with x86 processors.  Virtual memory approach eliminates the  time consuming need in the flat memory model for programmers to  assign each task a specific memory address and to keep track of  these allocations.

Title: Cluster file systems: A case study
Abstract: Traditional distributed file systems do not provide clusters with  strict single-system image, and cannot fully meet the cluster  applications requirements, such as I/O performance, scalability,  reliability, and availability.  COSMOS is a scalable single-image  file system designed for Dawning2000 superserver, a typical cluster  system.  This paper discusses the essential issues in designing  cluster file systems, and presents our solutions to them with  emphasis on COSMOS's novelty.  Measurements are given to show the I/O bandwidth, scalability and overall performance of COSMOS.  Based on  our experience with COSMOS and initial performance measurements, we  also point out the bottlenecks of the existing system and propose  methods for improvement. copy 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Medical image presentation system using Super High Definition (SHD)  imaging systems
Abstract: The wide spread of digital technology in the medical field has led to a demand for a high-quality, high-speed, and user-friendly digital  image presentation system for daily medical conferences.  To fulfill  this demand, we have developed a presentation system for  radiological and pathological images.  It is composed of a Super High Definition (SHD) imaging system, a radiological image database  (R-DB), a pathological image database (P-DB), and the network  interconnecting these three component.  We installed a system in NTT  East Kanto Hospital to evaluate it in the weekly case conferences.   The doctors evaluated the image quality and size, and found them  suitable for actual medical diagnosis.  They also appreciated the  short image-switching time and easy system operation that  contributed to smooth presentation.  Thus, we conclude that its  characteristics meet the requirements.  10 Refs.

Title: Multiplicative multifractal modeling of long-range-dependent (LRD)  traffic in computer communications networks
Abstract: Source traffic streams as well as aggregated traffic flows often  exhibit long-range-dependent (LRD) properties.  In this work, we  model traffic streams using multiplicative multifractal processes.   We develop two type of models, the multifractal point processes and  multifractal counting processes.  We demonstrate our model to  effectively track the behavior exhibited by the system driven by the actual traffic processes.  We also study the superposition of LRD  flows.  We prove that the superposition of a finite number of  multiplicative multifractal traffic streams results asymptotically  in another multifractal stream.  Furthermore we demonstrate  numerically that the superimposed process can be effectively modeled by an ideal multiplicative process.  11 Refs.

Title: Design of intelligent network performance analysis & forecast support system
Abstract: A system designed for supporting the network performance analysis and forecast effort is presented, based on the combination of offline  network analysis and online real-time performance forecast.  The  off-line analysis will perform analysis of specific network node  performance, correlation analysis of relative network nodes  performance and evolutionary mathematical modeling of long-term  network performance measurements.  The online real-time network  performance forecast will be based on one so-called hybrid  prediction modeling approach for short-term network performance  prediction and trend analysis.  Based on the module design, the  system proposed has good intelligence, scalability and  self-adaptability, which will offer highly effective network  performance analysis and forecast tools for network managers, and is one ideal support platform for network performance analysis and  forecast effort.  10 Refs.

Title: Parallel automated knowledge acquisition of case-based semantic  networks from relational databases
Abstract: The number of databases that are accessible over networks within  organizations is increasing.  This paper presents a methodology for  automatically converting the data in these into a useful knowledge  base of case-based semantic networks that can be accessed through a  browsing facility.  A parallel processing strategy has been  implemented for this knowledge acquisition process to support its  scalability to large databases.  This methodology has potential  application in the development of organizational intranets.  It can  also be used for retrospective browsing of the context of  interesting patterns discovered by data mining.  The database  examples used in this paper are from clinical laboratories that  provide data to a hospital infection control committee.  Even though  the results presented here use a single domain, the methodology can  be used with no changes to explore the construction of multidomain  knowledge bases.  14 Refs.

Title: Aggregating caches: A mechanism for implicit file prefetching
Abstract: We introduce the aggregating cache, and demonstrate how it can be  used to reduce the number of file retrieval requests made by a  caching client, improving storage system performance by reducing the impact of latency.  The aggregating cache utilizes predetermined  groupings of files to perform group retrievals.  These groups are  maintained by the server, and built dynamically using observed  inter-file relationships.  Through a simple analytical model we  demonstrate how this mechanism has the potential to reduce average  latencies by 75% to 82%.  Through trace-based simulation we  demonstrate that a simple aggregating cache can reduce the number of demand fetches by almost 50%, while simultaneously improving cache  hit ratios by up to 5%.  21 Refs.

Title: Analysis of timeout-based adaptive wormhole routing
Abstract: Although many adaptive routing algorithms have been proposed for  wormhole-routed networks, it is necessary to have clear  understanding of the factors that affect their potential performance before they can be widely adopted in commercial multicomputers.  This paper proposes a new analytical model of an adaptive routing  algorithm proposed by Duato in [11] .  The  main feature of this routing algorithm is the use of a timeout  mechanism to select a particular class of virtual channels at a  given router.  This has the advantage of reducing virtual channels  multiplexing, leading to improvement in network performance.   Simulation experiments reveal that the proposed analytical model  predicts message latency with a good degree of accuracy.  27 Refs.

Title: Requirements-based dynamic metrics in object-oriented systems
Abstract: Because early design decisions can have a major long-term impact on  the performance of a system, early evaluation of the high-level  architecture can be an important risk mitigation technique.  This  paper proposes a technique for predicting the volume of data that  will flow across a network in a distributed system.  The prediction  is based upon anticipated execution of scenarios and can be applied  at an extremely early stage of the design.  It is driven by  requirements specifications and captures dynamic metrics by defining typical usage patterns in terms of scenarios.  Scenarios are then  mapped to architectural components, and dataflow across  inter-partition links is estimated.  The feasibility of the approach  is demonstrated through an experiment in which predicted metrics are compared to runtime measurements.  14 Refs.

Title: Requirements modeling for organization networks: A (Dis)trust-based  approach
Abstract: Recently, viewpoint resolution methods which make conflicts  productive have gained popularity in requirements engineering for  organizational information systems.  However, when extending such  methods beyond organizational boundaries to social networks,  sociological research indicates that a delicate balance of trust in  individuals, confidence in the network as a whole, and watchful  distrust becomes a key success factor.  We capture these  relationships in the so-called TCD (Trust-Confidence-Distrust)  approach and demonstrate how this approach can be supported by a  dynamic requirements engineering environment that combines the  structural analysis of strategic dependencies and rationales, with  the interaction between planning, tracing, and communicative action.  An example drawn from an ongoing case study in entrepreneurship  networks illustrates our approach.  47 Refs.

Title: Virtual time synchronization over unreliable network transport
Abstract: In parallel and distributed simulations, it is sometimes desirable  that the application's time-stamped events and/or the simulator's  time-management control messages be exchanged over a combination of  reliable and unreliable network channels.  A challenge in developing  infrastructure for such simulations is to correctly compute  simulation time advances despite the loss of some simulation events  and/or control messages.  Presented here are algorithms for  synchronization in distributed simulations performed directly over  best-effort network transport.  The algorithms are presented in a  sequence of progressive refinement, starting with all reliable  transport and finishing with combinations of reliable and unreliable transports for both time-stamped events and time management  messages.  Performance results from a preliminary implementation of  these algorithms are also presented.  To our knowledge, this is the  first work to solve asynchronous time synchronization performed  directly over unreliable network transport.  11 Refs.

Title: On design and implementation of NET-RAM
Abstract: A NVM (Network Virtual Memory) system treats all the memories  distributed on the network as the memory of a single node so that an application can take the advantage of much larger memory resources  on the network.  This is especially suitable for such applications  which are not time-sensitive but need a large amount of memories.  A  method of implementing a NVM system by simplifying the distributed  shared memory management, which is used in our SNOW clustering  system, is introduced.  After giving the concept of network virtual  memory, we describe the architecture of a network virtual  system-NET-RAM and expatiate the structure of soft-cache.  The  prototype of NET-RAM is tested and the result is analyzed.  Finally,  the feature work to improve the NET-RAM system is discussed.  3 Refs.

Title: Cooperative multi-agent intelligent field terminals
Abstract: We have developed a method for improving cooperation in complex  systems that uses multi-agent (MA) intelligent field terminals  (IFTs).  The MA function evaluates the control conditions of the  overall system and the conditions of the other IFTs.  To shorten the  turn-around time for data transfer among IFTs, the conflicts that  occur when the data processed by different IFTs is inconsistent or  irregular must be resolved autonomously.  We thus incorporate a  predictive agent in each IFT, and these agents cooperate to resolve  the conflicts.  Experimental results showed that this method not only provides adequate controls but also reduces the load on the network  and the turn-around time when the number of IFTs is less than 30.  9  Refs.

Title: Performance modeling of elastic traffic in overload
Abstract: The simple preliminary models for an overloaded link accounting for  user impatience and reattempt behavior were discussed under  Markovian assumptions.  It was found that the degree of congestion on a network link was not easy to detect by observing the packet  arrival process.  Impatience was manifested by the interruption of a  session and may not be detectable as an abnormal event.  Impatience  interrupts large flows after a small fraction of their data had  transferred.  Aborted flows are not generally abandoned at first  attempt as users will frequently make a repeat attempt.  To perform  admission control an alternative overloaded link was allowed to  stabilize through impatience.  (Edited abstract) 4 Refs.

Title: An open approach for deploying programming nodes into communication  networks
Abstract: Nowadays, we are facing in the computer network research community  new challenges related to the concepts of programmable and active  networks.  Great efforts have been spent to make current data  communication networks more flexible and dynamic.  Unfortunately,  such efforts are followed by complexity and, therefore, the process  of deploying the mechanisms has been committed.  In order to make  this process simpler, this work presents an open approach for having programmable nodes that make computer networks more dynamic in terms of adding new services without increasing complexity.  This approach  presents SNPI (Simple Network Programming Interface), which is a  group of skeletons and data structures resources that make possible  to the programmers and developers a fast deployment of new services  into the network.  The mechanism presented allows the access to  internal mechanisms of data flow processing in the network nodes.  13 Refs.

Title: Analisis de prestaciones de un planificador de trafico sobre  plataformas de proposito general   Review of traffic scheduler features on general purpose platforms
Abstract: In this study, we review the features of a traffic scheduler running  on a general-purpose platform, specifically a PC with a Linux  operating system.  The traffic scheduler was configured to manage a  CBQ (Class Based Queueing) queue discipline, and by means of a  series of experiments, we proved that the limitations of the system  are due to the accuracy of the clock.  After we modified this factor, we reviewed the features of the scheduler again.  We were able to  prove that the features of the scheduler improve greatly at the  expense of a very small increase (around 10%) in the use of the  system's CPU.  16 Refs.

The relation  of cost and response-time is given as a monotonous decreasing and  convex function.  Regarding communication bandwidth as cost in an  information network, this problem means a minimum-cost tree shaped  routing for response-time constrained broadcasting, where any  response-time from a root vertex to other vertex is less than a  given time bound.  This problem is proven to be NP-hard and consists  of the minimum-cost assignment to a rooted tree and the minimum-cost tree finding.  A nonlinear programming algorithm solves the former  problem for the globally optimal solution.  For the latter problem,  different types of heuristic algorithms evaluate to find a near  optimal solution experimentally.  (Author abstract) 19 Refs.

Title: Applied study of optical interconnection link in computer cluster
Abstract: In this paper, some study results to apply fiber link to a computer  cluster are presented.  The research is based on a ring network  topology for a cluster system, which is connected by gigabit/s  virtual parallel optical fiber link (VPOFLink) and its driver is for Linux Operating System, the transmission protocol of VPOFLink is  compliant with Ethernet standard.  We have studied the effect of  different types of motherboard on transmission rate of the VPOFLink, and have analyzed the influence of optical interconnection network  topology and computer networks protocol on the performance of this  optical interconnection computer cluster.  The round-trip  transmission bandwidth of the VPOFLink have been tested, and the  factors that limit transmission bandwidth, such as modes of  forwarding data packets in the optical interconnection ring  networks, and the size of the link buffer etc, are investigated.

Title: Design and analysis of the communication protocol for TSOINet
Abstract: In this paper, a communication protocol has been designed for the  two-layer scalable optical interconnection network (TSOINet)  designed in Tianjin University.  The communication protocol has been  designed based on TCP/IP (transmission control protocol/internet  protocol) protocol.  But it is more efficient than TCP/IP for data  transmission in TSOINet.  An auxiliary channel has been introduced in TSOINet for transmission of the communication status messages among  the sub-layer rings.  Many network management functions, such as flow control, hand shaking, etc., can be achieved via the auxiliary  channel, so the communication overheads can be decreased.  The  performance of the communication protocol has been evaluated  compared to TCP/IP protocol for data transmission in TSOINet.   (Author abstract) 4 Refs.

Title: New genetic approach to universal rule generation from trained neural networks
Abstract: In this paper a new rule generation method from neural networks is  presented.  A neural network (NN) is formed using a genetic algorithm (GA) with virus infection and deterministic mutation to represent  regularities in training data.  This method utilizes a modular  structure in GA.  Each module learns a different neural network  architecture, such as sigmoid and a higher order neural networks.   Those chromosome information is communicated to the other modules by the virus infection.  The higher order units are connected to an  output unit or hidden units.  By using these architectures, rules can be extracted.  The results of computer simulations show that this  approach can generate obvious, network architectures and as a result simple rules.

Title: Collaborative design method on network
Abstract: Collaborative product development based on network is an important  research area in computer supporting collaborative work.  This paper  sets forth the idea that the collaborative product development mode  on Internet is a process of common understanding on product data and of collaborative decision making in stages.  There are several  techniques, which include expanded STEP product data for common  understanding, mutual operations and dynamic transfer of modules  between different platforms, and the decision coordination and  optimization techniques to support the process.  The process of  collaborative development based on network includes: establishing  information models for products in different stages, providing  modules by encapsulating products, accessing and transfering of  remote resources, sharing collaborative design processes, optimizing product performance and making decisions on collaboration.  CORBA and Java techniques are used to support the solving of the assessment,  optimization and collaborative problems solving.  6 Refs.

Title: Handling the incomplete data problem using Bayesian networks
Abstract: Much of the current research in learning Bayesian networks fails to  effectively deal with missing data.  This paper presents two methods  to account for missing data.  One method is to recast the incomplete  data set into a complete data set and then to learns Bayesian  networks from the complete data set.  The other is to learn Bayesian  networks directly from the incomplete data set and this method is  gradually corrected.  The experimental results show that the former  provides accurate results, but is inefficient; while the latter is  highly efficient, and can obtain good results when the data set is  large.  Furthermore, both methods perform better than other methods  that deal with missing data.  4 Refs.

Title: Computational learning mechanism of Bayesian approach and problem  solving
Abstract: This paper discusses the rationality of the Bayesian hypothesis of  non-informational prior from the information entropy point of view,  and emphasizes the analysis of the computational learning mechanism  in the Bayesian approach.  The results show that the Bayesian theorem averages the expectation of priors and the means of samples weighted according to their precision, and the higher the precision is, the  bigger the corresponding weights are.  With the premise of conjugate  priors, the posterior can be used as the prior in successive  combinations with new samples using the Bayesian theorem.  When this  procedure is repeated, the impact of samples is more and more  important, so the assessment of priors is vital to the efficiency  and quality of learning.  The Bayesian approach is suitable for data  mining and knowledge discovery problems characterized by probability and statistics.  5 Refs.

Title: Matrix-based substitution-permutation network against differential  cryptanalysis
Abstract: An important problem in the design of the block cipher is to improve  the performance of resisting differential crypto-analysis.  This  paper proposes a matrix-based substitution-permutation network as  the model of block cipher.  Based on this mode, a new  crypto-structure called completely-nonsingular-matrix-based  substitution-permutation network is designed.  The upper bound of the differential probability is developed for the completely nonsingular matrix-based substitution-permutation network.  The analysis proves  that the upper bound of the differential probability of the i rounds completely nonsingular matrix-based substitution-permutation network is greatly reduced when a large completely-nonsingular-matrix-based  substitution-permutation network is used.  Therefore, using large  completely-nonsingular-matrix-based substitution-permutation  networks can effectively improve cipher security in relation to  differential crypto-analysis.  3 Refs.

Title: Performance modeling and evaluation of topologies for low-latency SCI systems
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical performance characterization and  topology comparison from a latency perspective for the scalable  coherent interface (SCI).  Experimental methods are used to determine constituent latency components and verify the results obtained by  these analytical models as close approximations of reality.  In  contrast with simulative models, analytical SCI models are faster to solve, yielding accurate performance estimates very quickly, and  thereby broadening the design space that can be explored.   Ultimately, the results obtained here serve to identify optimum  topology types for a range of system sizes based on the latency  performance of common parallel application demands. copy 2001  Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Efficient architectures and algorithms for multicasting data in  computer communication networks
Abstract: This paper presents two network architectures with associated routing and multicast algorithms for improved performance under multicasting traffic conditions.  A conditionally nonblocking network, referred to as a Clos network, forms the basis for the development of efficient  multicast communication networks.  The Clos network is first analyzed under multicast traffic conditions for blocking and multicast  overflow probability.  The analysis determines the overflow  probability under two different multicast distribution assumptions.   The first distribution assumes all packets request the same number  of copies and the second distribution uses a random number of  requested copies.  An analysis of an extension of the presented  network to multiplexed parallel planes of a network shows a  significant improvement on the network performance and particularly  on the carried traffic load when compared with previously published  multicast architectures using different buffering strategies. copy  2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Technology mapping for SOI domino logic incorporating solutions for  the parasitic bipolar effect
Abstract: We present a technology mapping algorithm for implementing a random  logic gate network in domino logic.  The target technology of  implementation is Silicon on Insulator (SOI).  SOI devices exhibit an effect known as Parasitic Bipolar Effect (PBE), which can lead to  incorrect logic values in the circuit.  Our algorithm solves the  technology mapping problem by permitting several transformations  during the mapping process in order to avoid the PBE, such as  transistor reordering, altering the way transistors are organized  into gates, and adding pmos discharge transistors.  We minimize the  total cost of implementation, which includes the discharge  transistors required for correct functioning.  Our algorithm  generates solutions that reduce the number of discharge transistors  needed by 44.23% and reduces the size of the final solution by  11.66% on average.  14 Refs.

Title: An approach to mapping the timing behavior of VLSI circuits on  emulators
Abstract: The time spent in simulation grows in an exponential form with the  complexity of the circuit.  Therefore, improving the simulation speed can represent a significant profit regarding the verification time.   Several approaches can be used to speedup the simulation.  These  recent years, FPGAs have been used to develop emulators.  These  systems are composed of several thousands of FPGAs connected  together through a programmable network.  Although this approach  seems very attractive in regard of the speedup, all the information  included in a circuit description cannot be mapped on the emulator.   In this paper, we propose a method to reproduce the timing behavior  of the circuit on an emulator.  10 Refs.

Title: Distributed multi-resolution data integration using mobile agents
Abstract: We describe the use of the mobile agent paradigm to design an  improved infrastructure for data, integration in Distributed Sensor  Network (DSN).  We use the acronym MADSN to denote the proposed  Mobile-Agent-based DSN.  Instead of moving data to processing  elements for data integration, as is typical of a client/server  paradigm, MADSN moves the processing code to the data locations.   This saves network bandwidth and provides an effective means for  overcoming network latency, since large data transfers are avoided.   We study two important problems related to MADSN design - the  distributed integration problem, and the optimum performance  problem.  Compared to DSNs, a mobile-agent implementation of  multi-resolution data integration saves up to 90% of the data  transfer time.  For a given set of network parameters, we analyze the conditions under which MADSN performs better than DSN and determine  the condition under which MADSN reaches its optimum performance  level.  19 Refs.

Title: Fixed and adaptive model-based controllers for active queue  management
Abstract: In this paper we present new model-based controllers for active queue management (AQM) supporting TCP flows.  Our control design is based  on linearization of a previously developed TCP model using fluid  flow and stochastic differential equations.  An AQM using a simple PI controller is shown to significantly outperform RED AQM.  However, we show that both AQMs are unable to maintain performance as the number of flows increases.  To overcome this, we introduce a special type of adaptation, the externally excited adaptive loop (EEAL) controller.   In comparison to the PI AQM, the EEAL AQM exhibits faster response  to flow changes, and is able to give a dynamic estimate of the  number of flows.  12 Refs.

Title: Spanning tree algorithm for spare network capacity
Abstract: Restorability algorithms need to produce a good logical structure  that does not introduce delay and congestion problems.  This work  uses pre-configuration for detailed examination of the network and  proposes a tree as the logical topology.  The algorithm produces a  spanning tree from a WDM mesh network that allows for good  restorability while assuring a structure with short routing paths.   Shortest path method with cost on the links inversely proportional  to the spare capacity is used to find maximum capacity paths between the nodes.  Preliminary results show that varying the definition of  the cost on the links for the shortest path analysis achieves  different tradeoffs in network restorability vs. average path  length.  In some cases the restorability approaches optimum (for a  tree structure), while using minimum spare capacity.  9 Refs.

The quality of service based  on Internet becomes a focus of computer network research.

Title: Component-based active network architecture
Abstract: We believe that the 'killer application' of active networking will be the provision of services which are not known to either the hardware manufacturer or the vendor at the time of network deployment.  This  would enable the rapid deployment of new services by third parties,  and an unprecedented level of customisation by network  administrators and end users.  This vision, however, requires a  degree of flexibility not yet seen in any of the currently proposed  active router architectures.  The lack of flexibility found in  current active router designs has inspired us to develop a novel  component-based active router architecture enabling extensible  network programmability based on a progressive service composition  framework.  This document presents this architecture, LARA++,  discusses its rudimentary concepts, and illustrates by example how  its component architecture can benefit network programmability.  16  Refs.

Title: Network characterization service (NCS)
Abstract: Distributed applications require information to effectively utilize  the network.  Some of the information they require is the current and maximum bandwidth, current and minimum latency, bottlenecks, burst  frequency, and congestion extent.  This type of information allows  applications to determine parameters like optimal TCP buffer size.   In this paper, we present a cooperative information-gathering tool  called the network characterization service (NCS).  NCS runs in user  space and is used to acquire network information.  Its protocol is  designed for scalable and distributed deployment, similar to DNS.   Its algorithms provide efficient, speedy and accurate detection of  bottlenecks, especially dynamic bottlenecks.  On current and future  networks, dynamic bottlenecks do and will affect network performance dramatically.  25 Refs.

The detail design method is shown in the paper.  Finally, we describe the computer simulation of implementing several  2-objective Flow Shop Scheduling Problems and compare the computing  results of new method with MultiObjective Genetic Algorithm.

Title: Exploiting diversity of neural ensembles with speciated evolution
Abstract: In this paper, we evolve artificial neural networks (ANNs) with  speciation and combine them with several methods.  In general, an  evolving system produces one optimal solution for a given problem.   However, we argue that many other solutions exist in the final  population, which can improve the overall performance.  We propose a  new method of evolving multiple speciated neural networks by fitness sharing that helps to optimize multi-objective functions with  genetic algorithms, and several combination methods to construct  ensembles of ANNs.  Experiments with the UCI benchmark datasets show  that the proposed methods can produce more speciated ANNs and, thus, improve the performance by combining representative individuals with combination methods.  17 Refs.

Title: A Diffserv measurement-based admission control utilizing effective  envelopes and service curves
Abstract: Among recent trends in quality of service (QoS) provisioning is the  Differentiated Services (Diffserv) Architecture.  The successful  deployment of Diffserv requires an effective Connection Admission  Control (CAC), which needs to be scalable and relatively simple to  implement.  An efficient CAC provides a high degree of network  resource sharing among multiple traffic classes while satisfying  their quality-of-service requirements.  In this paper we present a  novel effective measurement-based CAC based on the so-called global  effective envelopes of an arriving traffic aggregate and the service curves of the corresponding departing traffic aggregate.  This  approach provides the statistical service guarantees to a variety of service classes within a Diffserv domain.  We show that the novel CAC algorithm does not depend on the underlying network topology and is  scalable.  To evaluate this approach, we perform a set of simulations on a number of bursty video traffic sources.  16 Refs.

Title: A role based modelling approach for the information infrastructure
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to evaluate alternative technical  solutions for the Information Infrastructure on the basis of a role  model.  The approach particularly applies to functions like mutual  access control and billing, which gain importance in a deregulated  communications market where multiple players cooperate to provide a  seamless service.  It is the main benefit of this new approach that  it takes into account the requirements which players in different  roles make on each other.  Its application makes transparent who will benefit from a proposed technical solution and who will not.  As an  example we discuss the 'Tick' micropayment scheme as a means to pay  services directly.  14 Refs.

Title: Path Selection with class distribution information in the integrated  network
Abstract: In an integrated network, QoS routing plays an essential role in  supporting various classes with different priority and  Quality-of-Service (QoS) characteristics.  The Path Selection  Procedure is an important part of the QoS routing scheme.  The  existing Path Selection Algorithms do not consider the class  distribution information of residual bandwidth (RB-CDI).  As a  result, these algorithms may cause the sessions of higher priority  classes to be preempted instead of those of lower priority classes.   We propose a new and straightforward Path Selection Algorithm to  solve this problem.  The proposing algorithm uses not only the  information of residual bandwidth amount but also RB-CDI.  We  evaluate the proposing algorithm by comparing with existing Path  Selection Algorithms.  The performance evaluations are done in  various situations.  We use the throughput of each class and the link utilization of the network as evaluation metircs.  16 Refs.

The rate region for MASCs with arbitrarily small but  non-zero error probabilities was studied by Slepian and Wolf.

Based on the new streaming  architecture, we have developed a flexible and efficient audio/video transmission system.  In order to eliminate heterogeneity problems  found in networks, end-systems and applications, we adopt the  concept of QoS media filter.  The individual or receiver-driven  quality of service requirement can be achieved through the  application of a QoS media filtering mechanism.  6 Refs.

Title: Analysis of deterministic routing in k-ary n-cubes with virtual  channels
Abstract: Adding virtual channels to wormhole-routed networks greatly improves  performance because they reduce blocking by acting as "bypass" lanes for non-blocked messages.  Although several analytical models have  been proposed in the literature for k-ary n-cubes with deterministic routing, most of them have not included the effects of virtual  channel multiplexing on network performance.  This paper proposes a  new and simple analytical model to compute message latency in k-ary  n-cubes with an arbitrary number of virtual channels.  Results from  simulation experiments confirm that the proposed model exhibits a  good degree of accuracy for various network sizes and under  different operating conditions.  The proposed model is then used to  investigate the relative performance merits of two different  organisations of virtual channels.  21 Refs.

Title: AMRB: Toward location and migration transparency of services
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new mobility-support model for  applications, Application Module Request Broker (AMRB).  We focus on  two types of mobility: host mobility and application code mobility.   These two types of mobility dynamically change the binding between  applications name and location in the network.  AMRB conceals these  changes of binding to reduce a complexity in development of  applications.  In AMRB, we deal with mobile application codes that  communicate with each other as Application Modules (AMs).  AMRB  provides AM's service transparent communication for applications by  using a specifier which does not need to include any network  location information.  Furthermore, applications can use AM's service transparently of migration by exploiting location management  mechanism.  In this paper, we describe the design and implementation  of AMRB and some evaluations.  Also, we demonstrate a sample  application that AMRB is effective for developing mobile sensor type applications.  19 Refs.

Title: An efficient adaptive broadcast algorithm for the mesh network
Abstract: Most existing broadcast algorithms proposed for the mesh do not scale well with the network size.  Furthermore, they have been mainly based on deterministic routing, which cannot exploit the alternative paths provided by mesh topology to reduce communication latency.  Motivated by these observations, this paper introduces a new adaptive  broadcast algorithm for the mesh.  The unique feature of our  algorithm is its ability to handle broadcast operations with only  two message-passing steps irrespective of the network size.  Results  from extensive comparative analysis reveal that the proposed  algorithm exhibits superior performance characteristics over those  of the well-known Recursive Doubling and Extending Dominating Node  algorithms.  16 Refs.

Title: Network Membership: A partition model for reliable mobile  communication
Abstract: We give a formal specification of a new model called Network  Membership for reliable mobile communication in asynchronous  distributed systems.  Our approach is new in the sense that the  Network Membership service does not have any join or leave  procedures.  We let the system flow, views are not forced and are  installed with stability.  The model is less restrictive than others  since no consensus is required.  The Network Membership allows  multiple partitions to operate simultaneously and provides  connectivity feedback.  We have build on top of this Network  Membership service an efficient reliable broadcast service that is  resistant to network partitions.  The protocol insures that all  recipients eventually receive the message even if a receiver has  been partitioned away at any time.  We show how we use an unreliable  channel detector in conjunction with data forwarding and stability  to achieve this goal.  24 Refs.

Abstract: In this paper, we present an adaptive version of the parallel  Distributive Join (DJ) algorithm that we proposed in [1 ] .  The adaptive parallel DJ algorithm can handle the  data skew in operand relations efficiently.  We implemented the  original and adaptive parallel DJ algorithms on a network of Alpha  workstations using the Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM).  We analyzed  the performance of the algorithms, and compared it with that of the  parallel Hybrid-Hash (HH) join algorithms.  Our results show that the parallel DJ algorithms perform comparably with the parallel HH join  algorithms over the entire range of the number of processors used  and for different join selectivities.  A significant advantage of the parallel DJ algorithms is that they can easily support non-equijoin  operations.  9 Refs.

Title: Design method for conceptual design of by-wire control: Two case  studies
Abstract: Safety critical mass produced products are today being implemented  without mechanical backup.  Most of these will have distributed  real-time computer networks, which must be ultra-dependable.  Here a  development method for future control-by-wire systems is presented.   By using a scalable software architecture and the systems' intrinsic redundancy it is possible to achieve the dependability requirements  cost-effectively.  The method starts with analyzing a functional  task-graph, which gives input for developing a non-redundant  architecture.  This non-redundant architecture is modified to meet  the dependability requirements by adding hardware redundancy.  The  functionality implemented in software is allocated to the network  according to some optimization criteria.  The proposed method has  been used in two cases; a fly-by-wire aircraft and a drive-by-wire  car.  12 Refs.

Title: A priority-based resource allocation strategy in distributed  computing networks
Abstract: In a distributed computing network, various types of resources  attached at nodes, such as disks, main memory, resident programs,  and printers, could be shared among applications.  To promote the  resource utilization, an efficient resource allocation algorithm for application requests should be developed.  In this paper, our system  model considers the factors such as the computation power of nodes,  the upper limit of shared programs, the transmission bandwidth of  peripherals, the channel bandwidth, and the quality of service (QoS) requirement of applications.  Based on these factors, a  priority-based resource allocation strategy is proposed and applied  to different environments, respectively.  The simulation results show that our strategy has a near optimal solution. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science Inc.  All rights reserved.  29 Refs.

Title: A multicast routing algorithm based on mobile multicast agents in  ad-hoc networks
Abstract: In this paper we describe a multicast routing algorithm, which builds upon mobile multicast agents of an ad-hoc network.  Mobile multicast  agents (MMAs) form a virtual backbone of an ad-hoc network and they  provide multicast tree discovery, multicast tree maintenance and  datagram delivery.  First, we construct a cluster-spine hierarchy  structure for an ad-hoc network.  Second, we propose a multicast  routing algorithm, which is inspired by Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance  Vector (AODV) routing protocol.  The results show that the MMA  multicast algorithm can simplify the multicast tree discovery,  reduce control overhead of the network, and increase the total  network throughput, in comparison with general AODV multicast  operation.  We also overcome the deficiency of CBRP multicast  routing, which places much burden on cluster heads.  14 Refs.

Abstract: Although the embedding of complete binary trees in faulty hypercubes  has received considerable attention, to our knowledge, no paper has  demonstrated how to embed a complete binary tree in a faulty  Flexible Hypercube.  Therefore, this investigation presents an  algorithm to facilitate the embedding job when the Flexible  Hypercube contains faulty nodes.  Of particular concern are the  network structures of the Flexible Hypercube that balance the load  before as well as after faults start to degrade the performance of  the Flexible Hypercube.  Furthermore, to obtain the replaceable node  of the faulty node, 2-expansion is permitted such that up to (n-2)  faults can be tolerated with congestion 1, dilation 4 and load 1.   copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Efficient parallel timing simulation of synchronous models on  networks of workstations
Abstract: In this paper we address the parallel timing simulation of  synchronous VLSI designs on a network of workstations (NOWs).  We  suggest combining cycle based and conventional timing simulation  techniques to achieve fast timing simulation even on NOWs which are  typically characterized by low bandwidth and high communication  latency.  In particular we execute a timing simulator on each node of the NOW and use cycle based simulation to produce synchronization  information required by the timing simulators.  As synchronization  information is generated exclusively by the cycle based simulator  there is no need for any communication between the timing  simulators.  To verify the feasibility and performance of our  approach we simulated several circuits using our approach.  The  results show that a significant speedup can be achieved even for  very small circuits. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights  reserved.  14 Refs.

Title: eClips: A new personalised multimedia delivery service
Abstract: This article presents a new multimedia personalisation service that  automatically extracts multimedia content segments (electronic  clips-called eClips), based on individual preferences (key  terms/words, content source, etc.) -which the user identifies in a  profile.  User profiles are stored in the service platform and  continually checked against new content in the system.  When matches  are found between a user profile and the content, the service  platform alerts the user that segments have been identified and  extracted.  The user may then view/play these automatically provided  segments (eClips).  In addition, the eClips service stitches the  clips of diverse sources together, providing an  automatically-generated multimedia experience that revolves around  the user's provided profile.  5 Refs.

Title: Spanning tree approach in all-terminal network reliability expansion
Abstract: A method is presented to maximize the reliability improvement of a  communication network through a new edge addition between an  existing node pair of the network.  The method does not require the  numerical reliability functions for determining such a node pair.   The node pairs are compared by the number of spanning trees  generated as a result of the connection of an additional link, and  then the node pair connection, which results in generating the  largest number of spanning trees, is determined.  The counting  process for the number of spanning trees of the expanded network is  based on the degree matrix (DM) of the network. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  19 Refs.

Title: Network heavy traffic modeling using alpha-stable self-similar  processes
Abstract: We propose a new model for network heavy-traffic approximation, based on alpha-stable self-similar processes, namely the skewed linear  fractional stable noise.  The model demonstrates more flexibility  than existing models in fitting different levels of burstiness and  correlation in the data.  Nonetheless, it is parsimonious in the  number of parameters, which have a direct physical meaning.  An  algorithmic procedure for the estimation of the model parameters is  presented, and an asymptotic lower bound of the residual queueing  distribution is derived.  Extensive simulations are presented, where  the new model is fitted to bursty Ethernet data collected at  Bellcore (now Telcordia) Laboratories.  Furthermore, new measurements of aggregate web and webcasting traffic are introduced along with  traffic generated by the fitted new model.  Queueing simulations of a G/D/1 system confirm our analytical results regarding the tail of  the queue distribution.  27 Refs.

Title: High functionalities for intelligent sensors, application to fuzzy  colour sensor
Abstract: If the main use of colour measurement is metrology, it is now  possible to find industrial control applications which use this  information.  Using colour in process control leads to specific  problems where human perception has to be replaced by colour  sensors.  This paper relies on the fuzzy representation of colours  that can be taken into account by fuzzy controllers.  If smart  sensors already include intelligent functionalities like signal  processing, or configuration, only few of them include  functionalities to elaborate the fuzzy representation of  measurements.  In this paper, we develop a solution where the numeric processing is performed locally by the sensor, and where fuzzy  processing is exported towards another computing resource by means  of the CAN network.  This paper presents the concept and the  application to a smart fuzzy spectrometer. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  14 Refs.

Title: Efficient support for skeletons on workstation clusters
Abstract: Beowulf class clusters are gaining more and more interest as low cost parallel architectures.  They deliver reasonable performance at a  very reasonable cost, compared to classical MPP machines.  Parallel  applications are usually developed on clusters using MPI/PVM message passing or HPF programming environments.  Here we discuss new  implementation strategies to support structured parallel programming environments for clusters based on skeletons.  The adoption of  structured parallel programming models greatly reduces the time  spent in developing new parallel applications on clusters.  The  adoption of our implementation techniques based on macro data flow  allows very efficient parallel applications to be developed on  clusters.  We discuss experiments that demonstrate the full  feasibility of the approach.  30 Refs.

Title: Designing multiprotocol label switching networks
Abstract: Multiprotocol label switching adds to the capabilities of IP networks in several ways.  Despite new capabilities, MPLS technology has much  in common with ordinary IP networks.  In turn, the design process for MPLS networks has much in common with the design of any IP network.   This article examines MPLS and IP technology with particular  emphasis on what is common between them.  The common design steps of  MPLS networks and other IP networks are outlined briefly, and those  issues specific to MPLS networks are covered in more detail.  This  article emphasizes MPLS point of presence design, routing design  issues for MPLS, and provisioning of sufficient label space.  11  Refs.

Title: A new CAN-like field network based on a star topology
Abstract: Because of the particular medium access technique they adopt,  Controller Area Networks (CAN) suffer from an intrinsic drawback  which severely limits the maximum bus length allowed at high bit  rates.  In this paper, a new proposal is presented, which is based on a star topology and enables to enlarge the CAN network extension  more than 10 times or, equivalently, to increase the bit rate of the same factor.  In the proposed scheme, a star coupler takes part  actively in the arbitration phase by disabling on-the-fly all the  nodes which lose the contention, so that the increased propagation  delays can be dealt with properly.  The new mechanism shows a  behaviour that is very similar to CAN, thus a reasonable degree of  compatibility with the original protocol and the technology of the  existing devices can be preserved. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Designing a parallel, distributed test system
Abstract: The increasing use of parallel architectures and networking  technologies has enabled test systems to break free from their  traditional structure.  Today's systems run multiple parallel tasks,  distribute testing among many computers, and publish live data  through the Internet to achieve faster performance, better  reliability, and increased connectivity with enterprise-wide  systems.  Specifically, software technologies and techniques will be  examined for developing and running parallel, distributed automated  tests and distributing test data between applications or across the  Internet.  If used correctly, the result of these techniques is a  higher performance, more robust test system.  In addition, we will  examine technologies that make creating these parallel, distributed  systems possible for not only the advanced test program developer,  but also the novice user.  5 Refs.

Title: Constructing delay-bounded multicast trees in computer networks
Abstract: In this paper we propose a distributed protocol for constructing  delay-bounded minimum-cost multicast trees in computer networks.  The proposed protocol does not require knowledge of the complete network topology.  Furthermore, it is unnecessary to know how many nodes are  in the networks and which nodes are group members in advance.  It is  shown, through analysis and simulation on a class of random graphs,  that our protocol only uses O(n) messages in the best case, where n  is the number of nodes in the networks.  Even in the worst case, our  protocol uses O(d*n) messages that has lower message complexity than previous protocols, where d is the average nodal degree.  32 Refs.

Title: Statistical traffic modeling and guaranteed service disciplines: A  performance evaluation paradigm
Abstract: In this paper, a new performance analysis framework for guaranteed  services is introduced.  Performance is evaluated in terms of the  loss probability and delay distribution statistically guaranteed.   Traffic sources are characterized statistically and are modeled with Markov-based processes.  The service is guaranteed by allocating a  service curve to each connection and some buffer space.  As service  curve based servers are not memoryless, the resulting queueing  system, called SBBP/Sc/1/K, is not Markovian.  For this reason, the  system is observed only at some renewal instants.  The process  obtained is Markovian and can be easily solved.  Then we use this  solution to evaluate the steady-state probabilities of the  SBBP/Sc/1/K process which are needed for the performance analysis.   copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  37 Refs.

Title: Development of an intelligent high-speed machining center
Abstract: This paper describes a method for constructing an intelligent,  high-speed machining system.  According to the stability lobe diagram theory, there may exist a wide, stable cutting area at high spindle  speeds.  When cutting in this regime, it is possible to realize high  productivity and efficiency and produce high quality products.  On  the other hand, when the spindle speed is high, the power  consumption of the spindle motor is high and the prevention and  control of thermal deformation is crucial.  Furthermore, a machining  state monitoring method in high spindle speed area should be  established.  The developed system has the following features: (1)  active thermal deformation compensation function, (2) a real-time  machining state judging function, and (3) a remote operation  function using a computer network.  16 Refs.

Title: A method of push-based communications scheduling for minimum latency  time
Abstract: It is desirable in data broadcast that, when data are updated, a  server outputs the updated data as soon as possible in order to  deliver the latest data to clients.  When two or more data updates  take place at the same time, the server has to choose which data to  output first.  We first define the latency time, which is the elapsed time from the time data are updated to the time they are broadcast.   Then, we propose methods to reduce mean latency time under the  circumstance that each datum has various user request ratios and  update probabilities.  Furthermore, we discuss output data selecting  algorithms which can decrease the computational load of the server.   10 Refs.

Title: Resource-limited energy-efficient wireless multicast of session  traffic
Abstract: In this paper, we address the impact of resource limitations on the  operation and performance of the broadcasting and multicasting  schemes developed for infrastructureless wireless networks in our  earlier studies.  These schemes, which provide energy-efficient  operation for source-initiated session traffic, were previously  studied without fully accounting for such limitations.  We discuss  the "node-based" nature of the all-wireless medium, and demonstrate  that improved performance can be obtained when such properties are  exploited by networking algorithms.  Our broadcast and multicast  algorithms involve the joint choice of transmitter power and tree  construction, and thus depart from the conventional approach that  makes design choices at each layer separately.  We indicate how the  impact of limited frequency resources can be addressed.  Alternative  schemes are developed for frequency assignment, and their  performance is compared under different levels of traffic load,  while also incorporating the impact of limited transceiver  resources.

In this system, a sales expert and multiagents provide  service as one body.  Moreover, To overcome problems in remote  consultation systems, we propose classifying customers during the  first stage of consultation, according to their characteristics.  For customers who have unclear goals, but understand the product  categories and have sufficient knowledge in the field, we have  developed an effective communication method in which a salesperson  and a manager cooperate with their agents to perform N Customer: M  expert communication with their customers.

Title: A comparative content analysis of face-to-face vs. ALN-mediated  teamwork
Abstract: This paper presents the content analysis results of a field  experiment comparing manual groups with groups using an Asynchronous Learning Network (ALN) to discuss and solve a case study.  Findings  how that ALN-mediated groups had broader discussions and submitted  more complete reports than their manual counterparts.  There was no  difference in the ability to transfer information from the  discussion to the report, in both conditions about 15 percent of  issues mentioned in the discussion were omitted from the final group report.  In terms of coordination, face-to-face teams covered the  case study questions sequentially and efficiently, like items on a  meeting agenda.  Asynchronous groups were more focused on solving  their general disagreements than on the worksheet questions and  adopted parallel and pooled coordination strategies to put together  the report.

From the 15 papers in which the effectiveness of ALN was compared to that for  face-to-face classes, 2/3 reported it was more effective, and the  remainder reported "no significant difference." Additional papers  are expected to be supportive of a need for better research  techniques in the ALN community.

Title: Study on the multicommodity reliability of a capacitated-flow network
Abstract: Traditionally, many researchers solved the multicommodity maximum  flow problem by assuming that the arcs of the flow network are  deterministic.  When the arcs are stochastic (i.e., the capacity of  each arc has several values), this article studies how to calculate  the probability that a capacitated-flow network with a unique source node satisfies a demand (d**1, d**2,..., d**p) at the unique sink  node, where d**k is the demand of commodity k. Such a probability is named the multicommodity reliability and is dependent on capacities  of arcs.  One solution procedure is proposed to evaluate the  multicommodity reliability, which includes two parts: an algorithm  to generate all (d**1, d**2,...,d**p)MPs and a method to calculate  the multicommodity reliability in terms of (d**1, d**2,...,  d**p)-MPs.  Two illustrative examples are given. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science Ltd.  11 Refs.

Title: On the construction of modular observers and diagnosers for  discrete-event systems
Abstract: A modular approach for designing observers and diagnosers for  detecting faults in large distributed systems is presented.  In  particular, the model is based on a discrete-event system framework.  The model assumes that the system is composed of distributed  components that interact with each other via sets of common  resources.  Modularity can be achieved by imposing a total ordering  on access to the common resources.  Further, a component's own access to a common resource is an observable event.  It is then possible to  partition component behavior such that an observer of a component's  behavior need not be aware of all the behavior of other components  that use the same resources.  Procedures for the design of such  observers and the subsequent construction of diagnosers are given.  9 Refs.

Title: Message latency in k-ary n-cubes with hop-based routing
Abstract: Many adaptive routing algorithms for wormhole-routed k-ary n-cubes  have been proposed to overcome the performance limitations of  deterministic routing.  However, before such routing schemes can be  successfully incorporated in future practical multicomputers, it is  necessary to develop a clear understanding of the factors that  affect their potential performance.  Boppanna and Chalasani have  recently proposed a routing algorithm (referred to as hop-based  routing) that achieves full adaptivity in wormhole-routed k-ary  n-cubes using a hop-based scheme borrowed from traditional store-and forward networks.  A new analytical model is prepared to compute  message latency in k-ary n-cubes with hop-based routing.  Results  from simulation experiments reveal that the proposed model exhibits  a good degree of accuracy in predicting message latency.  26 Refs.

Title: Experience with handling concurrent events in group communication  services
Abstract: Most group communication services are event driven, with multiple  events occurring concurrently at a group member during execution.   These concurrent event occurrences are typically handled by one of  two common implementation techniques: a sequential implementation  technique that uses a single thread of execution, and a parallel  implementation technique that uses multiple, concurrent threads of  execution.  In this article, the authors evaluate these two  techniques in the context of implementing a group communication  service.  This evaluation is based on a comparison of the performance measured from a sequential implementation and a parallel  implementation of a group communication service, and their past  experience in using these techniques to implement various group  communication services.  The conclusion is that a sequential  implementation is preferable to a parallel implementation of a group communication service.  A sequential implementation provides better  performance, scales better, and results in a simpler, more  manageable and portable code.  22 Refs.

Title: Epoch load sharing in a network of workstations
Abstract: This paper examines load sharing in a network of workstations (NOW).   It proposes a special load sharing method referred to as epoch load  sharing.  With this policy, load is evenly distributed among  workstations with job migration only at the end of predefined  intervals.  The time interval between successive load sharing is  called an epoch.  We compare the performance of epoch load sharing  with other traditional load sharing methods.  The objective is to  reduce the number of times that global system information is needed  to make allocation decisions, while at the same time achieving good  overall performance.  A simulation model is used to address  performance issues associated with load sharing.  Simulated results  indicate that epoch load sharing frequently succeeds in this  pursuit.  9 Refs.

Title: Java-based mobile asset location
Abstract: Owing to the way networks grow and the advent of mobile computing,  the task of physically locating assets is becoming increasingly  complex.  Network management tools are usually not suitable for  management of dynamically moving assets and provide almost no  facilities for asset localisation.  In addition, asset management  products delegate to human operators the task to identify physical  asset's location.  JLocator is a Java-based system that allows both  static and dynamic assets to be physically localised.  Based on SNMP  and Java, it enables users to locate assets through a simple web  interface and allows asset management systems to take advantage of  asset location information provided by JLocator.  Finally, its  distributed architecture makes it scalable and completely  platform-independent.  23 Refs.

Title: Optimal distributed location management in mobile networks
Abstract: An important issue in the design of future Personal Communication  Services (PCS) networks is the efficient management of location  information.  In this paper, we consider a distributed database  architecture for location management in which update and query loads of the individual database are balanced.  We obtain lower bounds to  the worst-case delay in locating a mobile user, to the average  delay, and to the call blocking probability.  We then propose a  dynamic location management algorithm that meets these lower bounds.  The optimality of this algorithm with respect to these three  performance measures, as well as simplicity, make it an appealing  candidate for distributed location management in PCS networks.  20  Refs.

Title: Assessing 'hands on' skills on CS1 computer & network technology  units
Abstract: Edith Cowan University (ECU) introduced a new curriculum in computer  and network technology based upon a market analysis of employer  expectations.  Uniquely, within Australia, this curriculum has  extensive workshop exercises that require students to work on  equipment they are likely to meet in the workplace and as such the  workshop environment is potentially hazardous to students.  It was  found that prospective employers often required both an assessment  and an assurance that students following this curriculum could work  to an acceptable industry standard.  The traditional forms of  assessment (examinations and assignments) did not fulfil this  requirement.  The authors therefore designed a Competency-Based  Assessment (CBA) to measure procedural knowledge and skills.  The CBA designed was simple, easy to use and can be implemented as part of a standard workshop without interrupting student activities.  15 Refs.

Title: Measuring service in multi-class networks
Abstract: Quality of Service mechanisms and differentiated service classes are  increasingly available in networks and servers.  While network  clients can assess their service by measuring basic performance  parameters such as packet loss and delay, such measurements do not  expose the network's core QoS functionality.  In this paper, we  develop a framework and methodology for enabling network clients to  assess a system's multi-class mechanisms and parameters.  Using  hypothesis testing, maximum likelihood estimation, and empirical  arrival and service rates measured across multiple time scales, we  devise techniques for clients to (1) determine the most likely  service discipline among EDF, WFQ, and SP, (2) estimate the server's parameters with high confidence, and (3) detect and parameterize  non-work-conserving elements such as rate limiters.  We describe the  important role of time scales in such a framework and identify the  conditions necessary for obtaining accurate and high confidence  inferences.  25 Refs.

Title: Algorithmic solution to second-order fluid flow
Abstract: We develop a numerically stable algorithm for the solution of a  general Fluid-Flow model in steady-state.  The fluid dynamics is  modulated by a Semi-Markov process, with Phase-type distributions  for the sojourn times.  We use an algorithmic solution to examine the impact of variance in the case of homogeneous On-Off sources, and  differences between the infinite and finite buffer case.  The need  for the complete distribution of the buffer is demonstrated through  analysis of two existing approximations, which perform  unsatisfactorily.  Our numerical results demonstrate the robustness  of the numerical algorithm; we compute both the CDF and the moments  of the process, over a wide range of time-scales and system  parameters.  19 Refs.

Title: Consistent group membership in ad hoc networks
Abstract: The design of ad hoc mobile applications often requires the  availability of a consistent view of the application state among the participating hosts.  Such views are important because they simplify  both the programming and verification tasks.  Essential to  constructing a consistent view is the ability to know what hosts are within proximity of each other, i.e., form a group in support of the particular application.  In this paper we propose an algorithm that  allows hosts within communication range to maintain a consistent  view of the group membership despite movement and frequent  disconnections.  The novel features of this algorithm are its  reliance on location information and a conservative notion of  logical connectivity that creates the illusion of announced  disconnection.  Movement patterns and delays are factored in the  policy that determines which physical connections are susceptible to disconnection.  15 Refs.

Title: Survivability analysis of networked systems
Abstract: Survivability is the ability of a system to continue operating  despite the presence of abnormal events such as failures and  intrusions.  Ensuring system survivability has increased in  importance as critical infrastructures have become heavily dependent on computers.  In this paper we present a systematic method for  performing survivability analysis of networked systems.  An architect injects failure and intrusion events into a system model and then  visualizes the effects of the injected events in the form of  scenario graphs.  Our method enables further global analyses, such as reliability, latency, and cost-benefit analyses, where mathematical  techniques used in different domains are combined in a systematic  manner.  We illustrate our ideas on an abstract model of the United  States Payment System.  19 Refs.

Title: Demand-driven service differentiation in cluster-based network  servers
Abstract: Service differentiation that provides prioritized service qualities  to multiple classes of client requests can effectively utilize  available server resources.  This paper studies how demand-driven  service differentiation in terms of end-user performance can be  supported in cluster-based network servers.  Our objective is to  deliver better services to high priority request classes without  over-sacrificing low priority classes.  To achieve this objective, we propose a dynamic scheduling scheme, called DDSD, that adapts to  fluctuating request resource demands by periodically repartitioning  servers.  This scheme also employs priority-based admission control  to drop excessive user requests and achieve soft performance  guarantees.  For each scheduling period, our scheme monitors the  system status and uses a queuing model to approximate server  behaviors and guide resource allocation.  Our experiments show that  the proposed technique achieves demand-driven service  differentiation while maximizing resource utilization and that it  can substantially outperform static server partitioning.  27 Refs.

Title: Message passing architectures for stochastic and dynamic distributed  real-time systems
Abstract: Distributed real time systems have recently evolved that are based on commodity computers and networking technologies.  In these systems,  critical system resources and functionality are distributed over  many different computers and networks.  The operational modes of  these systems include the integration of heterogeneous event driven  information flows from multiple sensor platforms that dynamically  change with the operational scenario.  The dynamic and stochastic  nature of these systems renders allocating the distributed resources based on a-priori worst case loading and capacity scenarios  impossible.  This paper first discusses the operational  characteristics of these systems that effect the requirements for a  messaging based communications system.  Appropriate message passing  protocols are then discussed.  Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the architectural support necessary for efficiently implementing  a message passing protocol in a dynamic and stochastic distributed  real time system.  20 Refs.

Title: Optimising thin clients for wireless computing via localization of  keyboard activity
Abstract: The thin client model is based on the classic client-server model  with all client activity processed at the server.  This model can be  exploited for providing an application-independent solution for  mobile computing where powerful fixed servers serve mobile thin  client devices with poor computing resources.  However high latency  in the wireless connection can lead to delay in display of keyboard  and mouse activities, thereby affecting the performance of the thin  client.  This can be remedied by handling certain client activities  locally, which will not only mitigate latency's ill effects but also reduce the volume of exchanged messages passed.  This short paper  presents an implementation and performance evaluation of a thin  client system that locally processes keyboard activities during  periods of high network latency.  2 Refs.

Title: Coded path routing: A new approach to broadcasting in 3-D meshes
Abstract: Broadcast is an important collective communication operation required by many real-world parallel applications.  This paper proposes the  Coded Path Routing (or CPR for short) as a new approach for  designing efficient broadcast algorithms for wormhole-switched  multicomputer networks.  A unique feature of the CPR is that a  message can be delivered to an arbitrary number of destination nodes with single start-up latency.  The CPR is then used to devise a new  broadcast algorithm for the all-port 3-dimensional mesh.  The  algorithm requires a fixed number of message-passing steps to  implement a broadcast operation irrespective of the network size.   Results from an extensive comparative analysis reveal that the  proposed algorithm exhibits superior performance characteristics  over those of the well-known Recursive Doubling and Extending  Dominating Node algorithms.  8 Refs.

Title: Evaluating STREAMS-based protocol stacks over high-performance  networks
Abstract: STREAMS-based protocol stacks have become integral components of many desktop operating systems.  STREAMS allows the use of different  communication Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) with  dynamically configurable protocol stacks.  This work compares these  APIs and protocol stacks using connectionless datagrams over Fast  Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet networks.  In recent years, STREAMS  implementations have evolved to overcome the limitations of  predecessors in order to provide better performance with emerging  high-speed networking technologies.  Our performance analyses  demonstrate the maximum performance that can be delivered to  end-user applications using two of the most recent STREAMS  implementations.  In addition, our experimental results demonstrate  the suitability of STREAMS as a promising framework for supporting  applications running over high-speed networks.  We hope that our  experiences will give network designers and developers useful  insights into STREAMS performance capabilities for supporting fast  networks emerging on the market today.  12 Refs.

Abstract: Liveness and safeness are important behavioral properties of nets (systems).  Many powerful results have been derived for some subclasses of Place/Transition nets (systems).  The aim of this contribution is to draw a general perspective of the liveness and safeness for Asymmetric Choice nets (AC nets).

Title: Admission control for providing statistical QoS in high-speed networks
Abstract: This paper presents an admission control scheme for providing Quality of Service (QoS) including delay tail distribution and loss probability in high-speed networks.  The relationship between resource allocation for flows modeled by on/off Markovian fluids and statistical QoS is established based on an analysis of the Markov process.  Using this theoretical result, the feasible test method of admission control for QoS provision is put forward.  Our proposed admission control scheme is optimal in that it takes account of the relative precedence of flows and represents a requirement for maximizing network revenue, while providing delay tail distribution and loss probability guarantee for multiple classes flows.  Its performance is investigated through numerical results.  (Author abstract) 11 Refs.

Title: Adaptive query processing strategy for mobile databases
Abstract: Concerning information access for portable terminals, various methods of managing positional information as well as access methods are considered.  Which is the optimum of those methods depends on network conditions, such as the speed of movement of the mobile host and the number of access requests to the mobile host.  This paper is concerned with data queries in a mobile computing environment.  The performance is evaluated for a system which can select the movement notification method in order to manage the position of the mobile host when the movement of the mobile host is detected, and the query processing method to process the query to the mobile host, from several alternatives.  This paper presents a system in which these methods are dynamically switched in order to reduce the traffic over the whole network, and presents analytically the selection principle based on network conditions.

Title: Availability evaluation of quorum-based mutual exclusion schemes in general topology networks
Abstract: The use of quorums is a well-known approach to achieving mutual exclusion in distributed environments.  In this paper, we propose a new availability evaluation method for quorum-based mutual exclusion schemes in the presence of failures.  Most of the previously proposed methods take neither the topology of systems nor link failures into consideration, and exhaustive state enumeration has been the only approach that can deal with them so far.  By incorporating a notion called Minimal Quorum Spanning Trees, this method can efficiently evaluate the availability of quorum-based mutual exclusion schemes in general topology networks with unreliable nodes and links.  Through experimental results, we show the superiority of the proposed method over exhaustive state enumeration.  (Author abstract) 27 Refs.

Title: Mediacups: Experience with design and use of computer-augmented everyday artefacts
Abstract: Our view of ubiquitous computing is artefact-centred: in this view, computers are considered as secondary artefacts that enable items of everyday use to communicate as networked digital artefacts.  This view is expressed in an artefact computing model and investigated in the Mediacup project, an evolving artefact computing environment.  The Mediacup project provides insights into the augmentation of artefacts with sensing, processing, and communication capabilities, and into the provision of an open infrastructure for information exchange among artefacts.  One of the artefacts studied is the Mediacup itself, an ordinary coffee cup invisibly augmented with computing and context-awareness.  The Mediacup and other computer-augmented everyday artefacts are connected through a network infrastructure supporting loosely coupled spatially defined communication.  (Author abstract) 16 Refs.

Title: Use of an electronic medical record in a department of cardiology
Abstract: A computer - network infrastructure was realized to integrate the different remote cardiovascular diagnostic laboratories with the data derived from CCU and the administrative information.  A variety of heterogeneous data, texts, signals, images is gathered from each peripheral unit, stored into a relational database (ARCA), processed and presented to health-care personnel by network-connected clinical workstations.  From August 1999 to August 2000 the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) of 754 patients hospitalized in a Cardiological department were collected; 7808 procedures were digitally integrated and for each patient was possible to calculate the number of tests performed during hospitalization and the quantity of drugs assumed.  The use of EMR allowed to obtain rapidly a clinical data integration; to access to patient data from any clinical Lab; to collect information to obtain patient cost definition.

Title: Model-based fault tolerant control reconfiguration for discrete event systems
Abstract: We describe a novel fault-tolerant approach for Discrete-Event Systems by integrating sensor fusion within a diagnosis and control reconfiguration mechanism.  This approach can automatically compute fault-tolerant control/reconfiguration actions which maintain pre-specified control objectives.  Our underlying framework is based on model-based diagnostic representations and algorithms, and integrates diagnostics and control reconfiguration for discrete event systems using a single modeling mechanism and suite of algorithms.  Given failures in the system, we describe a modeling approach that facilitates diagnostic isolation while performing sensor fusion to minimize false alarms, thereby increasing tolerance to sensor faults as well as (non-measurable) component faults.  We show how we can explicitly trade off the false alarm rate with other system constraints.  (Author abstract) 4 Refs.

Title: Perspective on next-generation ad hoc networks - a proposal for an open community network
Abstract: The concept of wireless ad hoc networking has unique features in which neither base stations nor wired backbone networks are required and a mobile node can communicate with a partner beyond the transmission range by multihopping.  In this paper, innovations and issues in ad hoc network technologies are reviewed.  The concept of a general-purpose ad hoc network is identified as a step toward next-generation ad hoc network development.  The concept of an open community network is then presented as a vision for general-purpose ad hoc networks.  An open community network is a novel information infrastructure for local communities based on wireless multihopping technologies, which may support an advanced information-oriented society in the twenty-first century.  As a case study, an experimental system using PHS (Personal Handy Phone System) is described and some research issues for developing an open community network are identified.

Title: Design and implementation of a VBR continuous media file server
Abstract: This paper describes the design and implementation of a file server for variable bit rate continuous media.  We address the problem of building a server where each stream may have a different bit rate and, more importantly, where the bit rate within a single stream may vary considerably.  Such a server has been implemented within a high-speed network environment.  The server is designed to be used in a heterogeneous environment and is linearly scalable.  A significant aspect of the design of the system is the detailed consideration of the variable bit-rate profile of each data stream in performing admission control for the disk and for the network.  This paper describes the system model, the user interface design, implementation details, and performance results based on initial experience with the server.  (Author abstract) 33 Refs.

Title: Time transformed machine for high speed computer network performance measurement
Abstract: Fiber optic transmission media can deliver broadband network performance measurement data at a rate faster than economically available electronics components can process them.  Commercial implementations seek to limit the amount of high-speed, high-cost electronics needed to recognize performance parameters in the bit stream passing a monitoring point.  A means is presented here for transforming these finite state recognizers into new machines that perform the same function but operate at slower speed for implementation in reconfigurable hardware.  This is accomplished by mapping N-bit sets from the input stream into new symbols that can be processed at rate 1/N while also generating N-bit output symbols.  The process is illustrated by example and a time versus space tradeoff analysis is presented.  (Author abstract) 9 Refs.

Title: TCP performance improvement over high-speed flow switching networks
Abstract: Future broadband networks may provide very high bandwidth on demand for certain applications e.g. download of a gigabyte file to a high-performance workstation.  Motivated by such applications, we study the performance of TCP under the scenario where there is long network latency and rapidly changing bandwidth.  We show that existing TCP cannot utilize the bandwidth effectively under such network dynamics.  We propose a modification of TCP that would separate the flow control from the loss recovery mechanisms, allowing the efficient use of the available bandwidth over a network that has a high bandwidth-delay product and in which the bandwidth can vary by orders of magnitude over a short period of time.  We present simulation results demonstrating the significant performance gain of our new approach.  (Author abstract) 11 Refs.

Title: New end-to-end probing and analysis method for estimating bandwidth bottlenecks
Abstract: We present a network friendly bandwidth measurement method, TOPP, that is based on active probing and includes analysis by segmented regression.  This method can estimate two complementing available bandwidth metrics in addition to the link bandwidth of the congested link.  Contrary to traditional packet pair estimates of the bottleneck link bandwidth, our estimate is not limited by the rate at which we can inject probe packets into the network.  We also show that our method is able to detect bottlenecks that are invisible to methods such as C-probe.  Furthermore, we describe scenarios where our analysis method is able to calculate bandwidth estimates for several congested hops based on a single end-to-end probe session.

Title: Hierarchical networks and the LSA N-Squared Problem in OSPF routing
Abstract: With N routers in a network running the OSPF routing protocol a network topology update can generate on the order of N**2 LSA packets.  This phenomenon, known as the LSA N-Squared Problem, severely degrades network performance and scalability.  Hierarchical OSPF network architectures have been proposed to reduce the number of LSAs that are generated by a network topology update.  We show that equal-size areas minimize the number of LSAs.  Then we derive the optimal number of areas and the size of areas to create the network producing the minimal number of LSAs.  Finally we show that the optimal network architecture reduces the number of LSAs from O(N**2) to O(N**1**/**3 center dot N).  (Author abstract) 6 Refs.

Title: Developing a multicast metric
Abstract: To further advance the deployment of multicast, many consider it necessary to provide a quantitative measure of the potential benefit of employing multicast rather than unicast.  We approach this problem in three ways.  First, we propose a rudimentary metric that can provide a reasonable measure of the benefit achieved by an active group using multicast instead of unicast.  Second, we discuss many of the issues inherent in developing multicast metrics and how these issues may be addressed to improve the accuracy of our model.  Third, we consider how characteristics of network topology and group distribution might offer a predictive estimate for the proposed metric.  In general, we identify two rules for evaluating the efficiency of multicast: (1) multicast efficiency increases as the average path length increases, and (2) fan-out close to the source decreases multicast's efficiency.

Title: Multi-step neural predictive techniques for congestion control - Part 1: Prediction and control models
Abstract: In this two-part paper, we describe a new congestion control scheme which employs an adaptive neural predictive technique to account for the control loop delays in the information transfer process in computer networks.  In feedback-based congestion control schemes, large information transfer delays make the rate control signals received at the data sources or the network access points from the network outdated.  The congestion control scheme described here employs a neural network to predict the state of congestion in a computer network over a prediction horizon.  Based on the neural predictor output, source rate control signals are obtained by minimizing a cost function which represents the cumulative differences between a set-point and the predicted output.  An analytical procedure for the source rate control signal computations is given using gradient functions of the neural network predictor.  (Author abstract) 11 Refs.

Title: Research on adaptive congestion control based on RTT
Abstract: There are no congestion control mechanisms in the continuous media stream communications where UDP is used.  This results in the network congestion easily and affects the quality of traffic communications.  In this paper, by both experiments and theories the round trip time(RTT) of UDP traffic on the Internet is researched profoundly.  On the basis of these, a congestion control algorithm which is driven by RTT is proposed for real-time video communication.  Compared with loss-rate based congestion control mechanisms, by using this algorithm, the real-time ability of control and oscillation constraint of network state etc are improved apparently.  So, this algorithm is more fit to the applications of real-time communication traffics.  In addition, in regard to how to select the optimum parameter values adopted in the control algorithm, analysis and discussion are presented in brief.  (Edited author abstract) 12 Refs.

Abstract: A test system framework TFDS (test system framework for distributed software system) is put forward for the testing of distributed programs, and as an illustration, its prototype implementation PSET (distributed program structure and event trace, revised version) on heterogeneous network platforms is introduced.  The main functions of TFDS are for unit testing and integration testing.  And the framework is divided into two parts: one for specification design and source code analysis, which works statically; and the other for program execution and event sequence manipulation, which works dynamically.  Along with TFDS, and by a component-based architecture, the functionality of the PSET can be easily improved and reinforced.  (Edited author abstract) 8 Refs.

Title: Differentiated services for the Internet based on dynamic buffer thresholds
Abstract: A new integrated scheme of differentiated services for the Internet is proposed.  In this scheme, a service which combines both delay and drop priority is provided to applications with clear service differentiation.  The integrated scheme is based on the dynamic buffer threshold (DBT) scheme.  In the DBT scheme, the threshold is dynamically varied in run-time based on the packet loss behaviors.  In the static buffer threshold (SBT) scheme, the variation of packet loss probabilities can be very large and there is no simple mathematical expression relating the threshold to the desired packet loss rate.  These problems are overcome with the DBT scheme.  The performance model of the scheme is given using stochastic Petri nets and is analyzed by simulation.  (Edited author abstract) 13 Refs.

Title: Analytical modeling of interconnection networks for parallel computers with wormhole routing
Abstract: The realistic analytical modeling method for analyzing interconnection networks with wormhole routing is set up by using birth-death process theory, which can be used to analyze and evaluate various parallel computer interconnection networks.  Message transfer process was analyzed in the model.  The relation between message arrival rate and message density of network channel was analyzed.  Mathematical descriptions on message transfer latency, waiting time of message on each node, and message density distributions among channels were also presented.  Compared to the queuing theory model, this analytical model makes more realistic assumptions on the system, and makes more detailed description on the communication process, so the results are close to the real one.  The analytical results are consistent with the simulation results.  (Edited author abstract) 4 Refs.

Title: On-line signature verification based on altitude and direction of pen movement
Abstract: Signature is widely used to authorize who issued the document.   However, signature has ambiguity, and it is difficult to distinguish the authentic signature from the mimicked signature only by the  bit-mapped pattern.  It is well expected that altitude and the  azimuth of gripped pen under signing depends on the shape of  writer's hand and the habit of writing.  In this paper, we propose a  new on-line writer authentication system using the pen altitude, pen azimuth, shape of signature, and writing pressure in real time.  From experimental results with writing information by 24 writers, it is  found that the authentication rate of 98% is obtained.  6 Refs.

Abstract: Web-based information systems (WIS) are new generation information  systems and have recently received considerable attention in systems development.  As yet little research has been reported on the general model for analysis and design of WIS.  This paper describes an  object-oriented model for WIS.  Five components that support WIS are  discussed.  They are: the Web site, business processes, knowledge,  the information infrastructure, and software agents.  These elements  are harmonised into a unified object-oriented paradigm.  The proposed WIS model extends traditional information systems analysis into the  context of WIS.  It could be useful for the development of WIS by  organisations in pursuing electronic commerce. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  31 Refs.

We describe a high performance technique with superior copy quality, based on two years of research, development, and production, that enables low skill  operators to freely distribute copy jobs.  This approach integrates  common devices with original image quality techniques, culminating  in flexible distribution options to support new digital  reprographics business models.

Yet for the ASP model  to become the computing industry's mainstream paradigm, ASPs must  make significant breakthroughs.  Built upon developments in selective outsourcing, application hosting, and browser-based computing, the  ASP model will shift the purchase of computing power from product to rented-service form.

Title: Recommendation systems: A probabilistic analysis
Abstract: A recommendation system tracks past actions of a group of users to  make recommendations to individual members of the group.  The growth  of computer-mediated marketing and commerce has led to increased  interest in such systems.  We introduce a simple analytical framework for recommendation systems, including a basis for defining the  utility of such a system.  We perform probabilistic analyses of  algorithms within this framework.  These analyses yield insights into how much utility can be derived from knowledge of past user actions.  25 Refs.

Title: Software solutions for the liberalized electric energy industry
Abstract: Few products can lay claim to 'just-in-time' delivery the way  electricity can.  When you flick the light switch, you expect light.   Right away.  The industry that delivers this on-demand power is  undergoing huge changes; liberalization and the consequent  restructuring of the industry have introduced many new players to  the business of producing, delivering and trading electricity.  Such  a complex market can only be mastered by an overlay of  eCommerce-dominated business processes - mapping new patterns of  ownership and trade onto the existing physical control systems.  ABB  has long been a leading supplier of software solutions designed to  meet the challenges posed by liberalization.

Title: Will it work?
Abstract: This paper describes experiences using Requirements Engineering (RE)  to reduce the risk of large heterogeneous distributed systems not  working in their intended environments.  Industry is creating  ever-larger systems by integrating increasingly complex smaller  systems.  As a result, systems integration is becoming a major, or  even dominant, risk in the production of systems such as an  aircraft, railway or telecommunications infrastructure.  In this  paper, we describe some practical techniques we use for the RE of  such integrated systems.  They aim to provide assurance, before  development, that the final integrated system will achieve its  overall requirements.  We illustrate the techniques with case studies drawn from their industrial application.  14 Refs.

Title: Probabilistic pricebots
Abstract: Past research has been concerned with the potential of embedding  deterministic pricing algorithms into pricebots: Software agents  used by on-line sellers to automatically price Internet goods.  In  this work, probabilistic pricing algorithms based on no-regret  learning are explored, in both high-information and low-information  settings.  It is shown via simulations that the long-run empirical  frequencies of prices in a market of no-regret pricebots can  converge to equilibria arbitrarily close to an asymmetric Nash  equilibrium; however, instantaneous price distributions need not  converge.  14 Refs.

Title: Trust-based facilitator for e-partnerships
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a facilitator that finds capable and  trustworthy partners on behalf of client users, which helps users  form and maintain e-partnerships for electronic commerce and  electronic collaboration.  Unlike existing capability-based  facilitators or matchmakers, the facilitator collects and maintains  private "word-of-mouth" trust information as well as capabilities  from each user and uses the information for personalized trust-based facilitation for each user, which is done through the facilitation  protocols and trust propagation mechanism.  Compared to other  existing trust mechanisms, the characteristics of trust, which this  facilitator handles, are  personalized-collaborative-subjective-qualitative-private.  7 Refs.

Title: Intelligent shopping mall agent based on user's preference
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an improved intelligent search engine for  electronic commerce shopping mall.  At present, most intelligent  search engines search goods simply based on input of customer's  preference.  However, it is hard to exactly understand the propensity of consumers, such as not dealing effectively with multiple  interests.  We offer internet shopping mall stores a more  intellectual search engine that does not depend on customer's  inadequate ready-made response but analyzes the preference of  customers after tracking and gathering enough purchasing pattern  data.  This allows the system to display product information of  customer's taste.  6 Refs.

Abstract: This paper discusses the visualization of the relationships in  e-commerce transactions.  To date, many practical research projects  have shown the usefulness of a physics-based mass-spring technique  to layout data items with close relationships on a graph.  We  describe a market basket analysis visualization system (MAV) using  this technique.  This system is described as the following: (1)  integrates a physics-based engine into a visual data mining  platform; (2) uses a 3D spherical surface to visualize the cluster  of related data items; and (3) for large volumes of transactions,  uses hidden structures to unclutter the display.  Several examples of market basket analysis are also provided.  11 Refs.

Title: Tradeoff between client and server transaction validation in mobile  environment
Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of mobile devices and services,  efficient support for mobile transactions has become extremely  important.  As locking based pessimistic approaches to concurrency  control have been known to be not very suitable for the mobile  environment, many optimistic concurrency control schemes have been  proposed to date, of which broadcast certification based approach is of special interest because of its simplicity and its efficient use  of the downlink bandwidth.  In this paper we propose modifications to the broadcast certification based protocol and show using simulation results how useful tradeoffs can be obtained between client side and server side validation, resulting in optimal performance.  12 Refs.

Abstract: The emphasis in manufacturing today is to "make what's ordered, and  ship what's made." To realize that goal, the journey from customer  contact to shop floor execution - via a fully integrated back office - must be made seamless.  Plant-floor information systems give  business information the granularity needed for execution, and in  turn keep the business informed of the fruits of its labor.   Manufacturing execution systems, supervisory control, data  historians, and information portals are the means by which today's  plant floors get fully wired into the information age.

Abstract: With the globalization of the world economy, it is imperative that  managers, both present and future, be sensitive to differences in  intercultural business communication.  In particular, the context of  global electronic commerce leads to an increasing use of email in  negotiating deals, which to this point has been carried out almost  exclusively via face-to-face (FTF) or other high-feedback media  (e.g., telephone) but not of non-FTF media.  This study, involving 20 participants, uses speech act theory and psycholinguistic analysis  to explore the affects of culture on non-FTF communication.  31 Refs.

Title: SI-Designer: A tool for intelligent integration of information
Abstract: SI-Designer (Source Integrator Designer) is a designer support tool  for semi-automatic integration of heterogeneous sources schemata  (relational, object and semi-structured sources); it has been  implemented within the MOMIS project and it carries out integration  following a semantic approach which uses intelligent Description  Logics-based techniques, clustering techniques and an extended  ODMG-ODL language, ODLi3, to represent schemata, extracted,  integrated information.  Starting from the sources' ODLi3  descriptions (local schemata) SI-Designer supports the designer in  the creation of an integrated view of all the sources (global  schema) which is expressed in the same ODi3 language.  We propose  SI-Designer as a tool to build virtual catalogs in the E-Commerce  environment.

Title: Electronic commerce adoption by SMEs in Singapore
Abstract: This study surveys the receptivity of Singaporean small and  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to the adoption of electronic  commerce.  Utilising a portion of Rogers' model of innovation  diffusion as the framework and treating electronic commerce (EC) as  a form of new innovation, we analyse factors affecting EC diffusion.  A multiple regression analysis is carried out, with the five  attributes of innovation highlighted by Rogers, to determine the  attributes that affect the willingness to adopt.  Of the five factors affecting adoption of electronic commerce by SMEs, only relative  advantage, compatibility and trialability appear significant, with  the overall regression explaining around 36 per cent of willingness  to adopt.

Title: Scenario methods for viewpoint integration in e-business requirements integration
Abstract: Before it makes sense to embark upon e-commerce systems development,  first the commercial and technical feasibility of an e-business idea must be established.  To this end, we describe how needs and  interests of various types of stakeholders can be expressed by  different viewpoint models.  We propose an extension of so-called use case maps (UCMs) to e-business requirements engineering, as a  scenario method to achieve the necessary viewpoint integration.   Furthermore, we show how this scenario method is employed in an  iteratively progressing 'spiral' process of e-business requirements  elicitation and analysis.  Our approach is practically illustrated by an e-business case study in electronic advertising.

Title: Defining electronic data interchange transactions with UML
Abstract: The application-to-application exchange of business data, known as  electronic data interchange (EDI), has not fulfilled the expected  potential.  The focus for the development of EDI standards should be  shifted from the interchange file to the information contained  within the business process.  The use of object oriented techniques  to model the semantics of business data permits the differentiation  from IT specific requirements.  In this paper we present the OO-edi  approach.  OO-edi is based on UML and the Rational Unified Process  (RUP).  Nevertheless, RUP is only a framework and guidelines on how  to exactly apply modeling must be specified.  The presented  customization of RUP is called UMM (UN/CEFACT's modeling  methodology).

Title: Enabling and measuring electronic customer relationship management  readiness
Abstract: This work provides a comprehensive customer-focused evaluation  framework that businesses can use to assess their electronic  customer relationship management (e-CRM) readiness.  The framework is intended to provide a big picture of the overall composition of  e-CRM, to facilitate gap analysis, and to support a monitoring and  feedback process.  Knowledge management, trust, and technology are  identified as key enablers of e-CRM.  We examine e-CRM in the context of the Craig's e-Business stakeholder model showing how value is  created for the customer.  Finally, we propose weighting and rating  scales to aid in assessing customer relationship management  readiness, and provide examples of their use.

Title: A case study on interactive exploration and guidance aids for  visualizing historical data
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of historical data  visualization.  We describe the data acquisition, preparation, and  visualization.  Since the data contain four dimensions, the standard  3D exploration techniques have to be extended or appropriately  adapted in order to enable interactive exploration.  We discuss in  detail two interaction concepts: (1) navigation with one fixed  dimension, and (2) quasi 4D navigation allowing to simultaneously  explore the four-dimensional space.  In addition, we also present a  picture-in-picture display mode, enabling the user to interactively  view the data, while "flying with" a particular event, tracking its  motion in time and space.  Finally, we present a technique for guided exploration and animation generation, allowing for a vivid gain of  insight into the historical data.  11 Refs.

Title: Volume rendering of fine details within medical data
Abstract: This paper presents a method concerning the volume rendering of fine  details, such as blood vessels and nerves, from medical data.  The  realistic and efficient visualization of such structures is often of great medical interest, and conventional rendering techniques do not always deal with them adequately.  Our method uses preprocessing to  reconstruct fine details that are difficult to segment and label, it detects the presence of fine geometrical structures, such as cracks  or cylinders that suggest the existence of, for example, blood  vessels or nerves; the subsequent volume rendering then displays  fine geometrical objects that lie on a surface.  The method can also  show structures within the volume, using a special "integration  sampling" scheme to portray reconstructed volume texture, such as  that exhibited by muscle fibers.  By combining the surface structure  and volume texture in the rendering, realistic results can be  produced; examples are provided.  24 Refs.

Title: Salient iso-surface detection with model-independent statistical  signatures
Abstract: Volume graphics has not been accepted for widespread use.  One of the  inhibiting reasons is the lack of general methods for data-analysis  and simple interfaces for data exploration.  An error-and-trial  iterative procedure is often used to select a desirable transfer  function or mine the dataset for salient iso-values.  New  semi-automatic methods that are also data-centric have shown much  promise.  However, general and robust methods are still needed for  data-exploration and analysis.  In this paper, we propose general  model-independent statistical methods based on central moments of  data.  Using these techniques we show how salient iso-surfaces at  material boundaries can be determined.  We provide examples from the  medical and computational domain to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.  13 Refs.

Title: Metodo para calibrar barometros basado en radiosondeos   Method for barometers calibration based on radiosonde observations
Abstract: A new method to calibrate fixed and portable barometers is described  and tested: The method is based on data from the World Net of  Radiosonde (WNR).  The World Meteorological Organization (WMO)  coordinates the WRN operations.  A demonstration of the method that  includes the calibration of a pair of barometers used jointly gave a standard estimation error of plus or minus 0.49 hPa (1014-779 hPa).   The level of that error permits the use of the pair in  meteorological applications.  An additional test of validation was  undertaken successfully.  The method was developed for the  continental equatorial area of South America, although, there is no  restrictions to its use in other tropical areas covered by the WNR.   9 Refs.

Title: Tracking remotely sensed cloud images in time and space
Abstract: Temporal and spatial analysis was applied to a sequence of cloud top  pressure (CTP) images and cloud optical thickness (TAU) images, and  a storm tracking algorithm was proposed.  A sequence of storm tracks  from the satellite images was developed from the satellite images.   Composite images were created by projecting ahead in time and  substituting the first valid pixel for missing data, and a variety  of CTP and TAU cut-off values were used to identify regions of  interest.  The region correspondences were determined from one time  frame to another which yielded the storm center coordinates.  The  obtained tracks were compared to the storm tracks computed from sea  level pressure data by matching the results first in time and then  in spatial distance.  (Edited abstract) 10 Refs.

Title: Real-time weather data on terrain
Abstract: This paper describes the visualization of 3D Doppler radar with  global, high-resolution terrain.  This is the first time such data  have been displayed together in a real-time environment.  Associated  data such as buildings and maps are displayed along with the weather data and the terrain.  Requirements for effective 3D visualization  for weather forecasting are identified.  The application presented in this paper meets most of these requirements.  In particular the  application provides end-to-end realtime capability, integrated  browsing and analysis, and integration of relevant data in a  combined visualization.  The last capability will grow in importance  as researchers develop sophisticated models of storm development  that yield rules for how storms behave in the presence of hills or  mountains and other features.  16 Refs.

Title: Metropolis Monte Carlo deconvolution technique compared to iterative  methods for noisy data
Abstract: The Metropolis Monte Carlo (MMC) technique performance is compared to the performance of an iterative deconvolution method.  In the MMC  approach to deconvolution two Monte Carlo Procedure (MCP) are run at the same time.  In one the blured data is used as a distribution  function for selection of pixels.  And the second MCP decides wether  to place a grain in the true data (true input) or not.  We show that  this approach improves the reconstruction process.  The blurred data  is obtained by convolving a 24 points input signal that has three  peaks with a 21 points wide Gaussian impulse response function  (IRF).  The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to compare the two  techniques.  The MSE is calculated by comparing the reconstructed  input signal with the true input signal.  The Signal-to-Noise-Ratios  (SNR) studied range from 10 to 150.  The type of noise used in this  study is Gaussian distributed additive noise.  15 Refs.

Title: Utilizing a class labeling feature in an adaptive bayesian classifier
Abstract: In this paper, the Mean-Field Bayesian Data Reduction Algorithm is  developed that adaptively trains on data containing missing values.   In the basic data model for this algorithm each feature vector of a  given class contains a class-labeling feature.  Thus, the methods  developed here are used to demonstrate performance for problems in  which it is desired to adapt the existing training data with data  containing missing values, such as the class-labeling feature.  Given that, the Mean-Field Bayesian Data Reduction Algorithm labels the  adapted data, while simultaneously determining those features that  provide best classification performance.  That is, performance is  improved by reducing the data to mitigate the effects of the curse  of dimensionality.  Further, to demonstrate performance, the  algorithm is compared to the classifier that does not adapt and  bases its decisions on only the prior training data, and also the  optimal clairvoyant classifier.  11 Refs.

Title: Ground truth collections at the MTI core sites
Abstract: The Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) selected 13 sites across  the continental US and one site in the western Pacific to serve as  the primary or core site for collection of ground truth data for  validation of MTI science algorithms.  Imagery and ground truth data  from several of these sites are presented in this paper.  These sites are the Comanche Peak, Pilgrim and Turkey Point power plants,  Ivanpah playas, Crater Lake, Stennis Space Center and the Tropical  Western Pacific ARM site on the island of Nauru.  Ground truth data  includes water temperatures (bulk and skin), radiometric data,  meteorological data and plant operating data.  The organizations that manage these sites assist SRTC with its ground truth data  collections and also give the MTI project a variety of ground truth  measurements that they make for their own purposes.  Collectively,  the ground truth data from the 14 core sites constitute a  comprehensive database for science algorithm validation.  3 Refs.

Title: Evaluation of a matrix factorization method for data reduction and  the unsupervised clustering of hyperspectral data using second order statistics
Abstract: We investigate a hyperspectral data reduction technique based on a  matrix factorization method using the notion of linear independence  instead of information measure, as an alternative to Principal  Component Analysis (PCA) or the Karhunen-Loeve Transform.  The  technique is applied to a hyperspectral database whose spectral  samples are known.  We proceed to cluster such dimension-reduced  databases with an unsupervised second order statistics clustering  method and we compare those results to those produced by first order statistics.  We illustrate the above methodology by applying it to  several spectral databases.  Since we know the class to which each  sample belongs to in the database, we can effectively assess the  algorithms' clustering/classification accuracy.  In addition to using unsupervised clustering of data for purposes of image segmentation,  we investigate this algorithm as a means for improving the integrity of spectral databases by removing spurious samples.  16 Refs.

Title: Efficient materials mapping for hyperspectral data
Abstract: Hyperspectral data rates and volumes challenge analysis approaches  that are not highly automated and efficient.  Derived products from  hyperspectral data, which are presented in units that are physically meaningful, have added value to analysts who are not spectral or  statistical experts.  The Efficient Materials Mapping project  involves developing an approach that is both efficient in terms of  processing time and analyzed data volume and produces outputs in  terms of surface chemical or material composition.  Our approach will exploit the typical redundancy inherent in hyperspectral data of  natural scenes to reduce data volume.  This data volume reduction is  combined with an automated approach to extract chemical information  from spectral data.  The results will be a method to produce maps of  chemical quantities that can be readily interpreted by analysts  specializing in characteristics of terrains and targets rather than  photons and spectra.  13 Refs.

Title: SAR image invariants from 3D scattering centers
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors have many advantages over  electro-optical sensors (EO) for target recognition applications,  such as range-independent resolution and superior poor weather  performance.  However, the relative unavailability of SAR data to the basic research community has retarded analysis of the fundamental  invariant properties of SAR sensors relative to the extensive  invariant literature for EO, and in particular photographic sensors.  Prior work that was reported at this conference has developed the  theory of SAR invariants based on the radar scattering center  concept and provided several examples of invariant configurations of SAR scatterers from measured and synthetic SAR image data.  This  paper will show that invariant scattering configurations can be  extracted from predicted 3D data scatterer data and used to predict  invariant features in measured SAR image data.  32 Refs.

Title: Monte Carlo study and statistical description of the radar scattering from 2D ships on rough sea surfaces
Abstract: In this paper, the results of a Monte Carlo simulation of the radar  cross section (RCS) of 2D targets on a rough sea surface are  presented.  Numerical data has been generated using the generalized  forward-backward (GFB) method to compute the RCS as a function of  incidence angle and wind speed for a large number of surface  realizations.  From the Monte Carlo simulation it is found that the  mean RCS of a given target on a rough surface is generally lower  than or equal to the RCS of the same target on a flat surface, while the maximum RCS is usually greater than or equal to the flat surface case.  It is also observed that the variations in the RCS introduced  by the rough surface become less significant as the elevation angle  approaches grazing.  The simulation data was used to obtain the  statistical distributions that best fit the numerical results.  3  Refs.

Title: Estimation of inhomogeneous permittivity profiles of spherical  objects from noisy scattering measurement data
Abstract: An accurate method for reconstructing inhomogeneous permittivity  profiles of spherically shaped objects from the measurement of noisy scattering data is presented.  The overall reconstruction is achieved in two basic steps.  In the first step, the direct problem is  formulated to obtain a non-linear differential equation involving a  frequency dependent reflection coefficient in a spherical coordinate system.  The second step involves the inversion of this non-linear  differential equation using our previously proposed renormalization  technique to obtain the unknown permittivity profile of spherically  shaped objects in terms of a spherical Fourier-Bessel transform of  the measured reflection coefficient data.  Several higher order TE-  and TM- mode illuminations with different noise levels have been  considered.  A good agreement between the actual and the  reconstructed profiles even under high noisy conditions shows the  validity of our proposed scheme.  7 Refs.

Title: A content based internet search engine for analysis and archival of  MPEG-1 compressed newsfeeds
Abstract: In this paper a specialised search engine for TV news editors as part of a system for analysis and presentation of MPEG compressed  newsfeeds is discussed.  The editor is supplied with additional  material relating to particular news items, which he can, for  example, use to prepare the accompanying text of newscasts.  The key  words for the search engine are extracted automatically from the  compressed MPEG newsfeeds.  This is a complex process including a  video analysis phase, image preprocessing of the frames with the  textual information and finally character recognition.  The extracted key words can on the one hand be used by news editors to search for  particular news items in a newsfeed and on the other to search for  additional information on the Interact.  All information supplied to  news editors is presented in a well-structured and clear fashion by  the ClaViPS system based on HTML pages.  11 Refs.

Title: Video scene segmentation using video and audio features
Abstract: In this paper we present a novel algorithm for video scene  segmentation.  We model a scene as a semantically consistent chunk of audio-visual data.  Central to the segmentation framework is the idea of a finite-memory model.  We separately segment the audio and video  data into scenes, using data in the memory.  The audio segmentation  algorithm determines the correlations amongst the envelopes of audio features.  The video segmentation algorithm determines the  correlations amongst. shot key-frames.  The scene boundaries in both  cases are determined using local correlation minima.  Then, we fuse  the resulting segments using a nearest neighbor algorithm that is  further refined using a time-alignment distribution derived from the ground truth.  The algorithm was tested on a difficult data set; the  first hour of a commercial film with good results.  It achieves a  scene segmentation accuracy of 84%.  9 Refs.

Title: Adaptive edge enhancement in SAR images. Training on the data vs.  training on simulated data
Abstract: Edge detection and edge enhancement in SAR images is, due to the  speckle effect, not so easily achieved.  Here we consider edge  enhancement as classification problem, i.e. we segment an image in  several edge classes and a no edge class.  Thus supervised  classification techniques become available.  We proposed an  artificial neural network approach and interpret the output as  'grade of being an edge pixel'.  For training of the network we  applied two training strategies: 1. Selection of training samples  from the data in a supervised way and 2. Artificial creation of  training samples based on speckle statistics using a speckle  simulation algorithm.  Both strategies are applied on a data set  acquired by DLR's E-SAR in L-Band.  The outputs of the edge  enhancement process are compared among each other and with RoA edge  detector.  6 Refs.

Title: Neural assemblies: Technical issues, analysis, and modeling
Abstract: Neurons often work together to compute and process information, and  neural assemblies arise from synaptic interactions and neural  circuits.  One way to study neural assemblies is to simultaneously  record from several or many neurons and study the statistical  relations among their spike trains.  From this analysis researchers  can try to understand the nature of the assemblies, which can also  lead to attempts at modeling the underlying mechanisms.  In this  review we discuss three important parts of this process: (1)  technical issues related to simultaneously recording more than one  single unit, (2) ways of analyzing the data and (3) recent models  offering hypothetical mechanisms of neural assemblies, especially  models which incorporate feedback. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: Evolutionary test environment for automatic structural testing
Abstract: Testing is the most significant analytic quality assurance measure  for software.  Systematic design of test cases is crucial for the  test quality.  Structure-oriented test methods, which define test  cases on the basis of the internal program structures, are widely  used.  A promising approach for the automation of structural test  case design is evolutionary testing.  Evolutionary testing searches  test data that fulfil a given structural test criteria by means of  evolutionary computation.  In this work, an evolutionary test  environment has been developed that performs fully automatic test  data generation for most structural test methods.  The introduction  of an approximation level for fitness evaluation of generated test  data and the definition of an efficient test strategy for processing test goals, increases the performance of evolutionary testing  considerably. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: An approximate lofting approach for B-spline surface fitting to  functional surfaces
Abstract: Owing to their specific functionality, surfaces are often given as  bivariate functions including non-polynomial or higher-order  polynomial terms.  It is necessary to represent them in standard  formats such as non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) for  approximation.  As most such surfaces require fine quality of  surfacing and high precision of manufacturing, accuracy should be  guaranteed in their representations.  As high accuracy is likely to  result in bulky and redundant representations, it is also important  to make them more compact.  For NURBS surfaces, control points must  be reduced without sacrificing accuracy.  This paper presents an  approximate lofting method for B-spline surface fitting to a  functional surface within a specified accuracy.  It adopts adaptive  sampling and multiple B-spline curve fitting.  The method is very  effective when the surface shape is longish or the cross-sectional  curves vary regularly in shape along a specific direction.  Some  experimental results demonstrate its usefulness and quality.  16  Refs.

Title: Visual design steering for optimization solution improvement
Abstract: The paradigm of Visual Design Steering is applied to formal optimal  design solution algorithms to improve efficiency, accuracy, and  reliability.  A formal procedure is presented that guides a designer  to utilize the method of Graph Morphing with a formal optimization  process.  The procedure starts with reduction of the problem for  visualization purposes through a ranking and reduction of design  variables and constraints.  The procedure then outlines how the  reduced problem may be visualized using the method of Graph  Morphing.  Following this procedure an initial point is selected  which can produce an improved final solution point in less time than if the solution were started from a random initial point.  Several  examples are presented which demonstrate this capability.  14 Refs.

Title: Blended Hermite interpolants
Abstract: In (Roschel, l997) B-spline technique was used for blending of  Lagrange interpolants.  In this paper we generalize this idea  replacing Lagrange by Hermite interpolants.  The generated subspline  b(t) interpolates the Hermite input data consisting of parameter  values t//i and corresponding derivatives a//i//,//j,  j=0,...,alpha//i-1, and is called blended Hermite interpolant (BHI).  It has local control, is connected in affinely invariant way with  the input and consists of integral (polynomial) segments of degree 2 center dot k-1, where k-1 greater than or equivalent max left brace  alpha//i right brace -1 denotes the degree of the B-spline basis  functions used for the blending.  This method automatically generates one of the possible interpolating subsplines of class C**k**-**1  with the advantage that no additional input data is necessary. copy  2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract: We show that the support vector machine (SVM) classification  algorithm, a recent development from the machine learning community, proves its potential for structure-activity relationship analysis.   In a benchmark test, the SVM is compared to several machine learning techniques currently used in the field.  The classification task  involves predicting the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase by  pyrimidines, using data obtained from the UCI machine learning  repository.  Three artificial neural networks, a radial basis  function network, and a C5.0 decision tree are all outperformed by  the SVM.  The SVM is significantly better than all of these, bar a  manually capacity-controlled neural network, which takes  considerably longer to train. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: Provision of data for on-line simulation
Abstract: A crucial factor for the quality and results of the on-line  simulation of a municipal sewage treatment system is the provision  of the requisite data in adequate quality and density.  Since the  measured data cannot be incorporated in a simulation model without  prior processing, it should be prepared in such a way that it can be converted to the model-related input quantities.  If individual input measuring signals fail, substitute value concepts must be developed  which are based on the remaining information.  With this it is  possible to ensure the continuous provision of data.  Various  approaches are possible in seeking a solution to this problem.  At  the Wupperverband a detailed programme of investigation on the  subject area of the processing of inflow data is being implemented  as a component of future on-line simulation at Wuppertal-Buchenhofen STP.  10 Refs.

Title: Monitoring river channel and flume surfaces with digital  photogrammetry
Abstract: This paper describes and illustrates a technique for high resolution  monitoring of the surface morphology of water-worked sediments.  The  monitoring uses close-range digital photogrammetry.  While  photogrammetry is a long-established technique, more recent  developments in digital photogrammetry allow application in fluvial  research to be highly cost effective in both flume and natural river channel studies.  Results are presented that involve two scales of  laboratory flume: a smaller-scale application associated with  sediment sorting processes in a straight channel; and a larger-scale application involving sediment transport and bed material feedbacks  in a meandering channel subject to overbank flows.  A preliminary  assessment of data quality is undertaken with encouraging results.   The precision of elevation estimates corresponds to the scale of the imagery acquired and hence may be controlled by design of the image  acquisition process.  24 Refs.

Title: Rough sets, decision algorithms and Bayes' theorem
Abstract: Rough set-based data analysis starts from a data table, called an  information system.  The information system contains data about  objects of interest characterized in terms of some attributes.  Often we distinguish in the information system condition and decision  attributes.  Such information system is called a decision table.  The  decision table describes decisions in terms of conditions that must  be satisfied in order to carry out the decision specified in the  decision table.  With every decision table a set of decision rules,  called a decision algorithm, can be associated.  It is shown that  every decision algorithm reveals some well-known probabilistic  properties, in particular it satisfies the total probability theorem and Bayes' theorem.  These properties give a new method of drawing  conclusions from data, without referring to prior and posterior  probabilities, inherently associated with Bayesian reasoning. copy  2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract: A metric definition follows from a comprehensive sequence of steps  that takes into account all the requirements of the representational theory of measurement.

It is the preservation of viewpoints in numerical  relations that we have tried to empirically validate for the metrics depth of inheritance tree (DIT) and number of children (NOC),  proposed by Chidamber and Kemerer [S.R.

Title: A Bayesian evaluation of simulation models of multiple-site fatigue  cracks
Abstract: The rivet holes along the longitudinal top row of the outer skin of  the fuselage over a two-bay length are considered as the independent structural unit for the simulated multiple-site fatigue cracks.   Models of multiple-site fatigue cracks are proposed.  The models are  divided into several phases with some uncertain parameters.  These  phases are incorporated sequentially into a computer code with the  Monte Carlo simulation method.  The Bayesian estimation of uncertain  parameters in the model can be identified on visual inspections by  the Bayesian procedure from in-service inspection data measuring  crack lengths of each rivet hole.  In summary, this study evaluates  effects of differences in the simulation models for the crack  coalescence and failure phase for the distribution of inspection  data measuring crack lengths with the Bayesian estimation of  uncertain parameters from simulated in-service inspection data. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: Business size distributions
Abstract: In a recent work, we introduced two models for the dynamics of  customers trying to find the business that best corresponds to their expectation for the price of a commodity.  In agreement with the  empirical data, a power-law distribution for the business sizes was  obtained, taking the number of customers of a business as a proxy  for its size.  Here, we extend one of our previous models in two  different ways.  First, we introduce a business aggregation rate that is fitness dependent, which allows us to reproduce a spread in  empirical data from one country to another.  Second, we allow the  bankruptcy rate to take a different functional form, to be able to  obtain a log-normal distribution with power-law tails for the size  of the businesses. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Applying the branch and bound technique to document similarity search
Abstract: This paper proposes a new mechanism for document similarity search,  which uses the indexing structure called signature tables.  The  mechanism of signature tables is originally invented for similarity  search of market basket data, and in this paper we apply it to  document data.  Since the characteristics of document data is  definitely different from that of market basket data, the  performance of similarity search is not satisfactory when the  mechanism is naively applied to document data.  In this paper, we  describe the reason why the naive application decreases the  efficiency, and propose some techniques for improving the  performance.  The results of simulation using real document data set  show that the proposed mechanism implements good performance.  6  Refs.

Title: Seismic facies characterization by monoscale analysis
Abstract: Relating sedimentary records to seismic data is a major challenge.  By shifting focus to a scale-invariant sharpness characterization for  the reflectors, we develop an attribute that can capture and  categorize the main reflector features, without being sensitive to  amplitudes.  Sharpness is defined by a scale exponent, which  expresses singularity order and determines the reflection  signature/waveform.  Local scale exponent estimates are obtained with a new monoscale method.  Compared to multiscale wavelet analysis, our method has the advantage of measuring transition exponents at a  single fixed scale using a simple on-off criterion.  The exponents  contain amplitude variation information and describe lithological  onsets.  We create an image of the earth's local singularity  structure by applying our method to seismic traces and well-log  data.  The singularity map facilitates interpretation, facies  characterization, and integration of well and seismic data.  17 Refs.

Abstract: A historical wind stress data is obtained based on the 925hPa winds  of NCEP reanalysis data and is compared to the FSU wind stress.  A  particular difference between the two wind stress data appears in  the eastern Pacific.  The prediction experiments with an intermediate ocean and statistical atmosphere model indicate that the prediction  skill of the tropical Pacific SST with the NCEP wind stress data is  better than of FSU wind stress for the period of 1980-1999.  In  particular, the prediction skill is considerably improved for the  recent years of 1992-1999, when the NCEP wind stress is used for the ocean initialization.  10 Refs.

Title: D-optimal response surface designs in the presence of random block  effects
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to help the reader in designing  D-optimal blocked experiments.  The block effects are assumed to be  random.  Therefore, in general, the optimal designs depend on the  extent to which observations within one block are correlated.  An  algorithm is presented that produces D-optimal designs for these  cases.  However, in three specific situations, the optimal design  does not depend on the degree of correlation.  These situations  include some cases where the block size is greater than or equal to  the number of model parameters, the case of minimum support designs  and orthogonally blocked first-order designs.  In addition, a  relationship is established between the design of experiments with  random block effects and the design of experiments with fixed block  effects.  Finally, it is shown that orthogonal blocking is an optimal design strategy. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights  reserved.  17 Refs.

Title: Glaciological applications with Landsat-7 imagery: Early assessments
Abstract: Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data from Landsat-7 are  providing glaciologists with an ever-expanding data set that makes a comprehensive monitoring of the global cryosphere feasible for the  first time in history.  Examples of ETM+ data illustrate its ability  to satisfy major scientific needs in the glaciological  subdisciplines of sea-ice, glacier, ice-cap, and ice-sheet research  with high-resolution optical satellite imagery.  Examples shown  include use as proxy ground-truth, positioning glacier termini and  snowlines, and determining snow facies boundaries.  The additional  ETM+ panchromatic band, at a higher spatial resolution of 15 m,  improves the spatial accuracy of these applications.  The  glaciological aspects of the Landsat-7 Long-Term Acquisition Plan  are discussed to show how the timing and location of the image  acquisitions will generate a cryospheric data set of unprecedented  utility for future research. copy 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

Title: An efficient digit-serial systolic multiplier for finite fields  GF(2**m)
Abstract: In this paper, an efficient digit-serial systolic array is proposed  for multiplication in finite fields GF(2**m) with the standard basis representation.  From the least significant bit first algorithm, we  obtain a new dependence graph and design an efficient digit-serial  systolic multiplier.  If input data comes in continuously, the  proposed array can produce multiplication results at a rate of one  every [m/L] clock cycles, where L is the  selected digit size.  The analysis results show that the proposed  architecture leads to a considerable reduction of computational  delay time with a moderate increase of hardware complexity, compared to the existing digit-serial systolic multipliers.  Furthermore,  since the new architecture has the features of regularity,  modularity, and unidirectional data flow, it is well suited to VLSI  implementation with fault-tolerant design.  13 Refs.

Title: Quality measures in applications of image restoration
Abstract: We describe a new method for the estimation of image quality in image restoration applications.  We demonstrate this technique on a  simulated data set of fluorescent beads, in comparison with  restoration by three different deconvolution methods.  Both the  number of iterations and a regularisation factor are varied to  enforce changes in the resulting image quality.  First, the data sets are directly compared by an accuracy measure.  These values serve to  validate the image quality descriptor, which is developed on the  basis of optical information theory.  This most general measure takes into account the spectral energies and the noise, weighted in a  logarithmic fashion.  It is demonstrated that this method is  particularly helpful as a user-oriented method to control the output of iterative image restorations and to eliminate the guesswork in  choosing a suitable number of iterations.  29 Refs.

Title: A Thomson scattering post-processor for the MEDUSA hydrocode
Abstract: In order to understand the physical processes that occur in  laser-produced plasmas it is necessary to diagnose the  time-dependent hydrodynamic conditions.  Thomson scattering is, in  principle, an ideal diagnostic as it provides a non-intrusive method of measuring ion and electron temperature, electron density, plasma  velocity, and heat flow.  We describe here a post-processor for the  MEDUSA hydrocode that simulates streak camera images of the Thomson  spectra.  The post-processor can be used in three ways: (1) creating  simulated streak camera images that can be compared directly with  experimental data, (2) evaluating experimental designs to determine  the viability of the Thomson scattering diagnostic, and (3) as an  automated data analysis routine for extracting hydrodynamic  parameters from a calibrated experimental streak camera image. copy  2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: Volume illustration: Nonphotorealistic rendering of volume models
Abstract: Accurately and automatically conveying the structure of a volume  model is a problem not fully solved by existing volume rendering  approaches.  Physics-based volume rendering approaches create images  which may match the appearance of translucent materials in nature,  but may not embody important structural details.  Transfer function  approaches allow flexible design of the volume appearance, but  generally require substantial hand tuning for each new data set in  order to be effective.  We introduce the volume illustration  approach, combining the familiarity of a physics-based illumination  model with the ability to enhance important features using  nonphotorealistic rendering techniques.  Since features to be  enhanced are defined on the basis of local volume characteristics  rather than volume sample value, the application of volume  illustration techniques requires less manual tuning than the design  of a good transfer function.  Volume illustration provides a flexible unified framework for enhancing structural perception of volume  models d through the amplification of features and the addition of  illumination effects.  38 Refs.

Title: Two-level volume rendering
Abstract: In this paper, we present a two-level approach for volume rendering,  i.e., two-level volume rendering, which allows for selectively using different rendering techniques for different subsets of a 3D data  set.  Different structures within the data set are rendered locally  on an object-by-object basis by either DVR, MIP, surface rendering,  value integration (x-ray-like images), or nonphotorealistic  rendering.  All the results of subsequent object renderings are  combined globally in a merging step (usually compositing in our  case).  This allows us to selectively choose the most suitable  technique for depicting each object within the data while keeping  the amount of information contained in the image at a reasonable  level.  This is especially useful when inner structures should be  visualized together with semitransparent outer parts, similar to the focus-plus-context approach known from information visualization.  We also present an implementation of our approach which allows us to  explore volumetric data using two-level rendering at interactive  frame rates.  29 Refs.

Title: Discovering nontrivial repeating patterns in music data
Abstract: A repeating pattern in music data is defined as a sequence of notes  which appears more than once in a music object.  The themes are a  typical kind of repeating patterns.  The themes and other nontrivial  repeating patterns are important music features which can be used  for both content-based retrieval of music data and music data  analysis.  In this paper, we propose two approaches for fast  discovering nontrivial repeating patterns in music objects.  In the  first approach, we develop a data structure called correlative  matrix and its associated algorithms for extracting the repeating  patterns.  In the second approach, we introduce a string-join  operation and a data structure called RP-tree for the same purpose.   Experiments are performed to compare these two approaches with  other.  The results are further analyzed to show the efficiency and  the effectiveness of our approaches.  42 Refs.

Title: A probabilistic analysis of spark paths in point/plane air gaps
Abstract: Analysis of data derived from sparks in point/plane gaps ranging from 45 to 400 mm has shown the similarity of the probability functions  determining the shape of the spark paths.  This is true, regardless  of gap width, when each path is divided into equal steps, here 2% of the gap width.  The probability functions were used to develop  improved simulations of the spark paths.  The simulations had been  seen previously to give visually similar tracks, but in this work  improved simulations are shown to give similar values for the small  amount by which the spark paths are, on average, displaced when the  pointed electrode is tilted.  The same agreement was found for the  degree of scatter of the spark paths about the mean.  It is  anticipated that the simulations can be generalized to a variety of  geometries and scaled up, to simulate and predict lightning strike  probabilities.  5 Refs.

Title: Development of a continuous radon concentration monitoring system in  underground soil
Abstract: A continuous radon (Rn-222) concentration monitoring system for use  in underground soil was developed and tested.  The system consists of a 19-mm-diameter, 1100-mm-long detector assembly and a  microprocessor based data logger.  A small volume chamber is  installed at the tip of the detector assembly.  A thin ZnS(Ag)  scintillator film inside the chamber and a photomultiplier tube  (PMT) detect alpha particles from radon and its daughters.  When the  system is in measurement, the detector part is buried into  underground soil.  An energy resolution of approximately 70 % full  width half maximum (FWHM) was obtained for 5.5 MeV alpha particles  from Am-241.  Both the rise time and fall time for the system were  measured to be approximately 1-2 h. Temporal variations in  underground radon concentration at different depths were  investigated simultaneously using four sets of the developed system.  The results confirmed that the developed system is useful for  continuous measurement of radon concentration in underground soil.   15 Refs.

Title: A spatial density analysis technique for the automatic classification of 4pi detector data
Abstract: In nuclear physics at intermediate energies, the use of multidetector arrays consisting of thousands of detectors is customary.  This paper presents a novel approach to the automatic classification of data  collected by the 4pi detector CHIMERA, constituted by 1192  telescopes of a thin silicon transparent detector coupled to a thick CsI(Tl) scintillator.  The method is based on spatial density data  processing and produces frequency distributions of the most  significant physical parameters.  These one-dimensional spectra can  be more easily analyzed than the standard two-dimensional scatter  plots.  With respect to manual or semiautomatic procedures, presently used for data analysis, our method offers the advantages of drastic  time reduction and unbiased criteria for cluster identification.  The proposed method can be successfully used in both off-line data  analysis and multidetector stability control.  15 Refs.

Title: Analysis of the westland data set
Abstract: The "Westland" set of empirical accelerometer helicopter data with  seeded and labeled faults is analyzed with the aim of condition  monitoring.  The autoregressive (AR) coefficients from a simple  linear model encapsulate a great deal of information in a relatively few measurements; and it has also been found that augmentation of  these by harmonic and other parameters can improve classification  significantly.  Several techniques have been explored, among these  restricted Coulomb energy (RCE) networks, learning vector  quantization (LVQ), Gaussian mixture classifiers and decision trees.  A problem with these approaches, and in common with many  classification paradigms, is that augmentation of the feature  dimension can degrade classification ability.  Thus, we also  introduce the Bayesian data reduction algorithm (BDRA), which  imposes a Dirichlet prior on training data and is thus able to  quantify probability of error in an exact manner, such that features may be discarded or coarsened appropriately.  13 Refs.

Title: Interval evaluations in the Analytic Hierarchy Process by possibility analysis
Abstract: Since a pairwise comparison matrix in the Analytic Hierarchy Process  (AHP) is based on human intuition, the given matrix will always  include inconsistent elements violating the transitivity property.   We propose the Interval AHP by which interval weights can be  obtained.  The widths of the estimated interval weights represent  inconsistency in judging data.  Since interval weights can be  obtained from inconsistent data, the proposed Interval AHP is more  appropriate to human judgment.  Assuming crisp values in a pairwise  comparison matrix, the interval comparisons including the given  crisp comparisons can be obtained by applying the Linear Programming (LP) approach.  Using an interval preference relation, the Interval  AHP for crisp data can be extended to an approach for interval data  allowing to express the uncertainty of human judgment in pairwise  comparisons.  7 Refs.

Title: Experimenting neural networks to forecast business insolvency
Abstract: This research investigates the way in which Neural Networks (NNs) can be used to forecast insolvency.  The research aimed at forecasting,  one for three years in advance, a clear disclosure of the legal  condition of insolvency in a joint-stock company based in Italy and  operating in the textile industry, through the analysis of the  official balance sheet.  The results refer to experiments which have  been carried out for three years, concerning a sample of about 500  companies in the textile sector, their balance sheets for a  three-year period (1990-1992) and the 'state of the art' in the  following two years (1993-1994).  The research has pointed out how  the problem of insolvency can be dealt with by using NNs in a  satisfactory way and has proved useful to show how important the  method of collecting data for a further analysis through NNs can be.  14 Refs.

Title: An ambulatory physiological monitor for animal welfare studies
Abstract: Monitoring physiological activity in freely moving subjects poses a  considerable challenge.  The Free-Range Physiological Monitor (FRPM)  is a novel instrumentation pack designed to record and analyze  physiological processes in ambulatory subjects for periods of 4  weeks and greater with no researcher intervention.  Up to 255  monitors can be used simultaneously, with data compression ratios of up to 100:1 being achieved by data analysis being performed on the  unit before the summarized results are transmitted by a 2 km range,  2.4 GHz radio link back to a base computer.  Power for indefinite  operation is provided by a solar panel.  Currently the FRPM is being  used to record the Auditory Evoked Response, electrocardiogram and  body temperature to investigate stress levels in farm animals during transportation and handling for animal welfare studies. copy 2001  Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Exploratory analysis of spatial data using interactive maps and data  mining
Abstract: We present new methods for analyzing geo-referenced statistical data.  These methods combine visualization and direct manipulation  techniques of exploratory data analysis and algorithms for data  mining.  The methods have been implemented by integrating two  hitherto separate software tools: Descartes for interactive thematic mapping, and the data mining toolbox Kepler.  In using these tools,  data analysis may proceed as a steady interaction between visual  inspiration and insights gained from mathematical-statistical  calculations.  After introducing the various components of the  methods and tools, the paper guides the reader through in-depth  examples of using the tools in the context of analysis of urban  demographic data.  In particular, it is shown how geography-based  classifications of urban districts can be related to available  thematic characteristics by applying the data mining algorithms  classification tree derivation, attribute weighting, and subgroup  discovery.  28 Refs.

Title: Comparision between crustal density and velocity variations in  Southern California
Abstract: We predict gravity from a three-dimensional V//p model of the upper  crust and compare it to the observed isostatic residual gravity  field.  In general this comparison shows that the isostatic residual  gravity field reflects the density variations in the upper to middle crust.  Both data sets show similar density variations for the upper  crust in areas such as the Peninsular Ranges and the Los Angeles  basin.  Both show similar variations across major faults, such as the San Andreas and Garlock faults in the Mojave Desert.  The difference  between the two data sets in regions such as the Salton Trough, the  Eastern California Shear Zone, and the eastern Ventura basin (where  depth to Moho is less than 30 km), however, suggests high-density  middle to lower crust beneath these regions.  Hence the joint  interpretation of these data sets improves the depth constraints of  crustal density variations.  18 Refs.

Title: Hydrological analysis of high resolution multifrequent,  multipolarimetric and interferometric airborne SAR data
Abstract: Hydrological applications, i.e. physically-based, distributed  hydrological modelling, require areal for input for parameterization and validation of water cycle components.  Active microwave remote  sensing research shows the eligibility of multifrequent,  multipolarimetric and interferometric SAR data to retrieve land use, topography, soil moisture and vegetation information.  In this study, data of the multifrequent, multipolarimetric and interferometric  airborne Experimental Synthetic Aperture Radar (E-SAR) were  evaluated and analysed to derive land use information, surface soil  moisture and plant water content using a standardized scheme.   Topographic information was derived using X-band single pass  interferometry.  Multipolarimetric L-Band data show the highest  information content of hydrologically relevant parameters.  The  hydrological parameters of land use and vegetation features (plant  water content, biomass, plant height) were derived with satisfying  accuracy.  Problems were encountered during the soil moisture  calculation as a result of the influence of vegetation on the L-band backscatter and the large incidence angles.  9 Refs.

Title: Simulating surface winds near the Great Salt Lake using the US Army  Battlescale Forecast Model
Abstract: The ability of a mesoscale model to forecast local diurnal winds is  largely determined by horizontal resolution and treatment of local  surface feature data.  The US Army Battlescale Model (BFM) reproduces these types of local surface flow patterns.  The current  effectiveness of the model is restricted due to lack of  high-resolution surface data (albedo, soil moisture, snow cover).  A  2 km grid has been created near the Great Salt Lake, and two 7-h  model simulations generated.  The day is in late May, during a time  of weak synoptic flow, with each run initializing at 1200 h 1200 h  UTC (0500 h LST).  One run initializes the surface fields with  uniform values, while the other uses more realistic values over the  regions of the salt flats and Great Salt Lake.  3 Refs.

Title: Validation of passive microwave snow algorithms
Abstract: Passive microwave satellite remote sensing can greatly enhance  large-scale snow measurements based on visible satellite data alone  because of the ability to acquire data through clouds or during  darkness as well as to provide a measure of snow depth or water  equivalent (SWE).  This study develops a validation methodology and  provides preliminary results from comparisons of several different  passive microwave algorithms, including both mid- and high-frequency channels, vertical and horizontal polarizations and polarization  difference approaches.  Snow extent derived from passive microwave  data is compared with the NOAA Northern Hemisphere snow charts.   Results clearly indicate those time periods and geographical regions where the two techniques agree and where they tend to consistently  disagree.  Validation of SWE derived from passive microwave data is  undertaken using measurements from snow course transects in the  former Soviet Union.  Preliminary results indicate a general tendency for nearly all of the algorithms to underestimate SWE.  17 Refs.

Title: The effect of competition on the efficiency of secondary schools in  England
Abstract: In this paper we calculate the technical efficiencies, based upon  multiple outputs - school exam performance and attendance rates - of all secondary schools in England over the period 1993-1998.  We then  estimate models to examine the determinants of efficiency in a  particular year, and the determinants of the change in efficiency  over the period.  Our results suggest that the greater the degree of  competition between schools the more efficient they are.  The  strength of this effect has also increased over time which is  consistent with the evolution of the quasi-market in secondary  education.  Competition is also found to be an important determinant  of the change in efficiency over time.  There is, however, some  evidence of conditional convergence between schools. copy 2001  Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  54 Refs.

In this  report we have monitored the detail behavior and the performance of  Objectivity Advanced Multithreaded Server (AMS) as one of the  candidate middle-ware for the world-wide distributed data analysis  environment.  The efficiency of single AMS transaction was found to  be very low over the large latency WAN, and the cause and the  possible implementation solution was studied. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science B.V.

Title: Distributed applications monitoring at system and network level
Abstract: Most distributed applications are based on architectural models that  do not involve real-time knowledge of network status and of their  network usage.  Moreover the new "network aware" architectures are  still under development and their design is not yet complete.  We  considered, as a use case, an application using ODBMS  (Objectivity/DB) for the distributed analysis of experimental data.   The dynamic usage of system and network resources at host and  application levels has been measured in different client/server  configurations, and on several LAN and WAN layouts.  The aim was to  study the application efficiency and behavior versus the network  characteristics and conditions.  The most interesting results of the  LAN and WAN tests are described.  System bottlenecks and limitations  have been identified, and efficient working conditions in the  different scenarios have been defined.  The behavior observed when  moving away from the optimal working conditions is also described.   copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  5 Refs.

Abstract: COMPASS is a new fixed target high rate experiment at CERN.  The  expected RAW data size is in the order of 300 TB per year, collected during about six months of data taking at the mean rate of 35 MB/s.   To fulfill the experiment requirements, the Collaboration decided to build the off-line system using new technologies.  The computing  power needed for RAW data processing has been estimated to be in the order of 2000 SPECint95, and will be provided by a farm of about 200 CPUs.  The reconstruction program is under development and is written using object-oriented techniques and C++ as the programming  language.

Title: GAUDI - A software architecture and framework for building HEP data  processing applications
Abstract: We present a software architecture and framework that can be used to  facilitate the development of data processing applications for High  Energy Physics experiments.  The development strategy follows an  architecture-centric approach as a way of creating a resilient  software framework that can withstand changes in requirements and  technology over the long lifetimes of experiments.  The software  architecture, called GAUDI, supports event data processing  applications that run in different processing environments, from the high level triggers in the on-line system to the final physics  analysis.  We present our major architectural design choices and  outline the arguments that led to these choices.  Several iterations  of a software framework based on this architecture have been  released and the framework is now being used by the physicists of  the collaboration to facilitate the development of data processing  algorithms.  Object oriented technologies have been used throughout.   copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  10 Refs.

Features such as the mechanisms for scheduling algorithms, configuring the application and managing  the dependences among modules are described in detail.  In  particular, a major effort has been placed on providing a service  for managing persistent data and the experience using a commercial  ODBMS (Objectivity/DB) is therefore described in detail. copy 2001  Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: A review of analytical methods for lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic  and tin determination used in proficiency testing
Abstract: The methods used by laboratories participating in FAPAS**R  proficiency testing covering trace metals have been reviewed.   Techniques that tend to give the highest percentage of satisfactory  z-scores are identified.  Comparisons are made of digestion and  extraction techniques, use of atomic absorption spectrophotometry  (AA: graphite furnace and flame) and inductively coupled plasma  techniques (ICP-OES and ICP-MS).  It does not follow that one  technique is more accurate than the others, because some individual  laboratories consistently achieve satisfactory results using any of  the five main digestion techniques and any of the major detection  techniques.  The results do, however, give an indication of which  techniques are easier to perform correctly and with a high standard  of accuracy.  There are also other factors that may influence results such as instrument set-up, background correction and data analysis.   10 Refs.

Title: Data reduction methods for reverse engineering
Abstract: Reverse engineering is an emerging technology that promises to play a role in reducing product development time.  Reverse engineering in  this paper refers to the process of creating engineering design data from existing parts.  It creates or clones an existing part by  acquiring its surface data using a scanning or measurement device.   Recently, laser scanning technology has improved significantly and  has become a viable option in capturing geometries of complicated  design models.  3D laser scanners have become more accurate and the  speed of data acquisition has increased dramatically.  However, they  generate up to thousands of points per second, and handling the huge amount of point data is a major problem.  It becomes quite important, therefore, to reduce the amount of acquired point data and convert  it into formats required by the manufacturing processes while  maintaining the accuracy.  This paper presents methods that can  reduce efficiently the amount of point data.  13 Refs.

Title: On continuity and consistency of l - script infinity optimal models
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the question of continuity of the  mapping from observed time series to models.  The behavioral  framework is adopted to formalize a model identification problem in  which the observed time series is decomposed into a part explained  by a model and a remaining part which is ascribed to noise.  The  misfit between data and model is defined symmetrically in the system variables and measured in the l - script infinity or amplitude norm.  With the introduction of proper notions of convergence, it is shown  that the misfit function continuously depends on both the data and  the model.  Two notions of consistency are formalized and it is shown that the continuity of the misfit function implies a consistent  identification of optimal and suboptimal models. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science B.V.

Title: Testing for nonlinearity in high-dimensional time series from  continuous dynamics
Abstract: We address the issue of testing for nonlinearity in time series from  continuous dynamics and propose a quantitative measure for  nonlinearity which is based on discrete parametric modelling.  The  well-known problems of modelling continuous dynamical systems by  discrete models are addressed by a subsampling approach.  This  measure should preferably be combined with conventional surrogate  data testing.  The performance of the test is demonstrated by  application to simulated, heavily noise-contaminated time series  from high-dimensional Lorenz systems, and to experimental time  series from a high-dimensional mode of Taylor-Couette flow.  We also  discuss the discrimination power of the test under surrogate data  testing, when compared with other well-tried test statistics. copy  2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Structure-selection techniques applied to continuous-time nonlinear  models
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of choosing the multinomials that  should compose a polynomial mathematical model starting from data.   The mathematical representation used is a nonlinear differential  equation of the polynomial type.  Some approaches that have been used in the context of discrete-time models are adapted and applied to  continuous-time models.  Two examples are included to illustrate the  main ideas.  Models obtained with and without structure selection are compared using topological analysis.  The main differences between  structure-selected models and complete structure models are: (i) the former are more parsimonious than the latter, (ii) a predefined  fixed-point configuration can be guaranteed for the former, and  (iii) the former set of models produce attractors that are  topologically closer to the original attractor than those produced  by the complete structure models. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Solubility and diffusivity of Co//2 in triethanolamine solutions
Abstract: The objective of this study was to measure directly the physical  solubility and diffusivity of CO//2 in aqueous triethanolamine (TEA) solutions via the protonation method.  The method is based on the  protonation of TEA solutions by HCl prior to contacting the  solutions to CO//2 to eliminate the solutions reactivity with CO//2.  The properties were measured for concentrations of 10, 20, and 30  mass% TEA in the solution over the temperature range (20-60) degree  C. The volumetric and the wetted sphere methods were used to measure the solubility and diffusivity, respectively.  The measured data of  solubility and diffusivity were well fitted versus temperature by an exponential form.  The measured properties by the protonation  technique and the available literature values measured by the "N//2O analogy" method were compared.  Good agreement between the two  methods was found.  17 Refs.

Abstract: The density of phenylphosphorus dichloride over a temperature range  from 30.90 degree C to 66.00 degree C and viscosity over a  temperature range from 23.00 degree C to 57.20 degree C .as well as  the density and viscosity of dichlorophenyl phosphine sulfide over a temperature range from 20.00 degree C to 55.00 degree C were  measured.  The measured density data were fitted to a second-order  polynomial.  The absolute averaged deviation (AAD%) of density for  phenylphosphorus dichloride and dichlorophenyl phosphine sulfide are (2.5 multiplied by 10**-**2)% and 7.08%, respectively.  The measured  viscosity data were fitted to the Andrade equation.  The absolute  averaged deviation (AAD%) of viscosity for phenylphosphorus  dichloride and dichlorophenyl phosphine sulfide are 2.31% and 4.04%, respectively.  Abnormal behaviour (similar to that of pure water) of  dichlorophenyl phosphine sulfide was found.  Its density increases  with temperature increase below a approximately equals 33 degree C  with a maximum of 1.1230 kg center dot dm**-**3 at this t  emperature.  Above this temperature, density decreases with increases in temperature.  3 Refs.

Title: AR spectral estimation by application of the Burg algorithm to  irregularly sampled data
Abstract: Many methods have been developed for spectral analysis of irregularly sampled data.  Current popular methods such as Lomb-Scargle and  resampling tend to be biased at higher frequencies.  Slotting methods fail to consistently produce a spectrum that is positive for all  frequencies.  In this paper, a new estimator is introduced that  applies the Burg algorithm for AR spectral estimation to unevenly  spaced data.  The new estimator can be perceived as searching for  sequences of data that are almost equidistant, and then analyzing  those sequences using the Burg algorithm for segments.  The estimated spectrum is guaranteed to be positive.  If a sufficiently large data  set is available, results can be accurate even at higher  frequencies.  12 Refs.

Title: Engineering of distributed control systems
Abstract: Besides the functional view on distributed control systems, the  engineering aspect becomes more and more important.  It will be  essential to integrate the whole engineering process.  Here the  transport of information without losses from one engineering (live  cycle) phase to an other must be provided.  It is proposed here, to  regard the distributed control system as a product as defined in ISO 10303 (STEP).  Then all the methods and the already built  infrastructure of STEP are available.  The problem of describing the  distributed control system is put down to the problem of describing  product data (solved in STEP).  This approach is validated by  reference implementations as "Advanced Control Network" (ACORN) and  "Modular, open and distributed Function Block systems for  automation" (MOVA).  7 Refs.

Title: Evolution of safety-critical requirements post-launch
Abstract: This paper reports the results of a small study of requirements  changes to the onboard software of three spacecraft subsequent to  launch.  Only those requirement changes that resulted from  post-launch anoma-lies (i.e., during operations) were of interest  here, since the goal was to better understand the relation-ship  between critical anomalies during operations and how safety-critical requirements evolve.  The results of the study were surprising in  that anomaly-driven, post-launch requirements changes were rarely  due to previous requirements having been incorrect.  Instead, changes involved new requirements (1) for the software to handle rare events or (2) for the software to compensate for hardware failures or  limitations.  The prevalence of new requirements as a result of  post-launch anomalies suggests a need for increased  requirements-engineering support of maintenance activities in these  systems.  The results also confirm both the difficulty and the  benefits of pursuing requirements completeness, especially in terms  of fault tolerance, during development of critical systems.  13 Refs.

Title: Cramer-Rao lower bounds for low-rank decomposition of  multidimensional arrays
Abstract: Unlike low-rank matrix decomposition, which is generically nonunique  for rank greater than one, low-rank three-and higher dimensional  array decomposition is unique, provided that the array rank is lower than a certain bound, and the correct number of components (equal to array rank) is sought in the decomposition.  Parallel factor  (PARAFAC) analysis is a common name for low-rank decomposition of  higher dimensional arrays.  This paper develops Cramer-Rao Bound  (CRB) results for low-rank decomposition of three-and  four-dimensional (3-D and 4-D) arrays, illustrates the behavior of  the resulting bounds, and compares alternating least squares  algorithms that are commonly used to compute such decompositions  with the respective CRBs.  Simple-to-check necessary conditions for a unique low-rank decomposition are also provided.  28 Refs.

Title: Two-dimensional substring indexing
Abstract: As databases have expanded in scope to storing string data (XML  documents, product catalogs), it has become increasingly important  to search databases based on matching substrings, often on multiple, correlated dimensions.  While string B-trees are I/O optimal in one  dimension, no index structure with non-trivial query bounds is known for two-dimensional substring indexing.  In this paper, we present a  technique for two-dimensional substring indexing based on a  reduction to the geometric problem of identifying common colors in  two ranges containing colored points.  We develop an I/O efficient  algorithm for solving the common colors problem, and use it to  obtain an I/O efficient (poly-logarithmic query time) algorithm for  the two-dimensional substring indexing problem.  Our techniques  result in a family of secondary memory index structures that trade  space for time, with no loss of accuracy.  We show how our technique  can be practically realized using a combination of string B-trees  and R-trees.  23 Refs.

Title: A condensed representation to find frequent patterns
Abstract: Given a large set of data, a common data mining problem is to extract the frequent patterns occurring in this set.  The idea presented in  this paper is to extract a condensed representation of the frequent  patterns called disjunction-free sets, instead of extracting the  whole frequent pattern collection.  We show that this condensed  representation can be used to regenerate all frequent patterns and  their exact frequencies.  Moreover, this regeneration can be  performed without any access to the original data.  Practical  experiments show that this representation can be extracted very  efficiently even in difficult cases.  We compared it with another  representation of frequent patterns previously investigated in the  literature called frequent closed sets.  In nearly all experiments we have run, the disjunction-free sets have been extracted much more  efficiently than frequent closed sets.  11 Refs.

Title: Efficient computation of temporal aggregates with range predicates
Abstract: A temporal aggregation query is an important but costly operation for applications that maintain time-evolving data (data warehouses,  temporal databases, etc.).  Due to the large volume of such data,  performance improvements for temporal aggregation queries are  critical.  In this paper we examine techniques to compute temporal  aggregates that include key-range predicates (range temporal  aggregates).  In particular we concentrate on SUM, COUNT and AVG  aggregates.  This problem is novel; to handle arbitrary key ranges,  previous methods would need to keep a separate index for every  possible key range.  We propose an approach based on a new index  structure called the Multiversion SB-Tree, which incorporates  features from both the SB-Tree and the Multiversion B-Tree, to  handle arbitrary key-range temporal SUM, COUNT and AVG queries.  We  analyze the performance of our approach and present experimental  results that show its efficiency.  18 Refs.

Title: Spectral analysis of data
Abstract: Experimental evidence suggests that spectral techniques are valuable  for a wide range of applications.  A partial list of such  applications include (i) semantic analysis of documents used to  cluster documents into areas of interest, (ii) collaborative  filtering - the reconstruction of missing data items, and (iii)  determining the relative importance of documents based on  citation/link structure.  Intuitive arguments can explain some of the phenomena that has been observed but little theoretical study has  been done.  In this paper we present a model for framing data mining  tasks and a unified approach to solving the resulting data mining  problems using spectral analysis.  These results give strong  justification to the use of spectral techniques for latent semantic  indexing, collaborative filtering, and web site ranking.  18 Refs.

Title: Representation and extraction of volumetric attributes using  trivariate splines: A mathematical framework
Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to leverage traditional strengths from the  geometric design and scientific visualization communities to produce a tool valuable to both.  We present a method for representing and  specifying attribute data across a trivariate NURBS volume.  Some  relevant attribute quantities include material composition and  density, optical indices of refraction and dispersion, and data from medical imaging.  The method is independent of the granularity of the physical geometry, allowing for a decoupling of the resolution of  the carried data from that of the volume.  Volume attributes can be  modeled or fit to data.  A method is presented for efficient  evaluation of trivariate NURBS.  We incorporate methods for data  analysis and visualization including isosurface extraction, planar  slicing, volume ray tracing, and optical path tracing, all of which  are grounded in refinement theory for splines.  The applications for  these techniques are diverse, including such fields as optics, fluid dynamics, and medica l visualization.  15 Refs.

Title: Max-Fit biarc fitting to STL models for rapid prototyping processes
Abstract: This paper presents a method of Max-Fit biarc curve fitting technique to improve the accuracy of STL files and to reduce the file size for rapid prototyping.  STL file has been widely accepted as a de facto  standard file format for the rapid prototyping industry.  However,  STL format is an approximated representation of a true solid/surface model, and a huge amount of STL data is needed to provide sufficient accuracy for rapid prototyping.  This paper presents a Max-Fit biarc  curve fitting technique to reconstruct STL slicing data for rapid  prototyping.  The Max-Fit algorithm progresses through the STL  slicing intersection points to find the most efficient biarc curve  fitting, while improving the accuracy.  Our results show the proposed biarc curve-fitting technique can significantly improve the accuracy of poorly generated STL files by smoothing the intersection points  for rapid prototyping.  Therefore less strict requirements (i.e.   Loose triangle tolerances) can be used while generating the STL  files.  19 Refs.

Title: Monotonic evolution: An alternative to induction variable  substitution for dependence analysis
Abstract: We present a new approach to dependence testing in the presence of  induction variables.  Instead of looking for closed form expressions, our method computes monotonic evolution which captures the direction in which the value of a variable changes.  This information is then  used in the dependence test to help determine whether array  references are dependence-free.  Under this scheme, closed form  computation and induction variable substitution can be delayed until after the dependence test and be performed on-demand.  To improve  computative efficiency, we also propose an optimized (non-iterative) data-flow algorithm to compute evolution.  Experimental results show  that dependence tests based on evolution information matches the  accuracy of that based on closed-form computation (implemented in  Polaris), and when no closed form expressions can be calculated, our method is more accurate than that of Polaris.  15 Refs.

Title: Data locality enhancement by memory reduction
Abstract: In this paper, we propose memory reduction as a new approach to data  locality enhancement.  Under this approach, we use the compiler to  reduce the size of the data repeatedly referenced in a collection of nested loops.  Between their reuses, the data will more likely remain in higher-speed memory devices, such as the cache.  Specifically, we  present an optimal algorithm to combine loop shifting, loop fusion  and array contraction to reduce the temporary array storage required to execute a collection of loops.  When applied to 20 benchmark  programs, our technique reduces the memory requirement, counting  both the data and the code, by 51% on average.  The transformed  programs gain a speedup of 1.40 on average, due to the reduced  footprint and, consequently, the improved data locality.  32 Refs.

Title: A synthesis of memory mechanisms for distributed architectures
Abstract: Producing efficient parallel programs for distributed memory  multiprocessors is a difficult task.  Hand-coding efficient parallel  programs for these systems can be extremely difficult, time  consuming and error-prone, so people have turned to the shared  memory abstraction and automatic parallelizing compilers to ease the task.  The two main approaches to this are using compilers that 1)  generate message passing code, or 2) generate code for a distributed shared memory software layer.  Neither has been completely successful for all types of programs.  In this paper, we discuss the use of a  combination of these mechanisms to produce a compiler code  generation paradigm that can be successful for many user programs.   The experimental results indicate that our new paradigm would be  able to support both regular and irregular code efficiently.  22  Refs.

Title: Slacks-based measure of efficiency in data envelopment analysis
Abstract: In this paper, we will propose a slacks-based measure (SBM) of  efficiency in Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA).  This scalar measure  deals directly with the input excesses and the output shortfalls of  the decision making unit (DMU) concerned.  It is units invariant and  monotone decreasing with respect to input excess and output  shortfall.  Furthermore, this measure is determined only by  consulting the reference-set of the DMU and is not affected by  statistics over the whole data set.  The new measure has a close  connection with other measures proposed so far, e.g.,  Charnes-Cooper-Rhodes (CCR), Banker-Charnes-Cooper (BCC) and the  Russell measure of efficiency.  The dual side of this model can be  interpreted as profit maximization, in contrast to the ratio  maximization of the CCR model.  Numerical experiments show its  validity as an efficiency measurement tool and its compatibility  with other measures of efficiency.  (Author abstract) 23 Refs.

Title: Revealing gross errors in critical measurements and sets via  forecasting-aided state estimators
Abstract: State estimators are important monitoring tools which process  real-time data in power system control centers.  The capability of  detecting and identifying bad data depends on the redundancy level  of the information to be processed.  Network changes or a temporary  malfunction of the data acquisition system reduce data redundancy  for state estimation.  Measurement redundancy deterioration can be  characterized by the presence of critical measurements and sets.  For the vast majority of data validation algorithms, it is impossible to process gross errors in critical measurements and sets.  This paper  proposes an algorithm for detecting, identifying and removing bad  data in critical measurements and sets through forecasting-aided  state estimators.  Using the IEEE-14 bus test system, the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated and discussed through the  simulation of different levels of data redundancy degradation.

Title: Analysis of simulation factorial experiments by EDF resample  statistics
Abstract: The output from simulation factorial experiments can be complex and  may not be amenable to standard methods of estimation like ANOVA.  We consider the situation where the simulation output may not satisfy  normality assumptions, but more importantly, where there may be  differences in output at different factor combinations, but these  are not simply differences in means.  We show that EDF statistics can provide a similar but potentially more sensitive analysis to that  provided by ANOVA.  Moreover we show that with the use of resampling, we can generate accurate critical values for tests of hypothesis  under much weaker conditions than those required for ANOVA tests.   The method is illustrated with an example based on an actual  simulation experiment comparing two methods of operating a  production facility under different production levels.

Title: Developing industrial strength simulation models using Visual Basic  for Applications (VBA)
Abstract: Since 1984 the author has developed simulation models that use input  data from spreadsheets.  These original applications used a  standalone Basic program to convert Lotus 123 data into Siman  Experiment Frames.  While this process has evolved overtime, it did  not reach a truly viable level until Arena 3.0 introduced Visual  Basic for Applications (VBA) by Microsoft.  This advanced tutorial  demonstrates the basic concepts developed by the author to transfer  data between Excel and Arena.  The same techniques can be used to  communicate simulation data with a wide range of VBA supported  tools, such as Access, AutoCAD, and Visio.  Arena permits the model  developer to use VBA as the model file is loaded, executed, or  terminated or as entities flow through the Arena model modules.  This tutorial focuses on the design of Excel workbooks for simulation  applications and the transfer of data to/from Arena using VBA.   (Author abstract) 8 Refs.

Title: Experimental comparison of model-based clustering methods
Abstract: We compare the three basic algorithms for model-based clustering on  high-dimensional discrete-variable datasets.  All three algorithms  use the same underlying model: a naive-Bayes model with a hidden  root node, also known as a multinomial-mixture model.  In the first  part of the paper, we perform an experimental comparison between  three batch algorithms that learn the parameters of this model: the  Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, a  winner take all' version of the EM algorithm reminiscent of the K-means algorithm, and  model-based agglomerative clustering.  We find that the EM algorithm  significantly outperforms the other methods, and proceed to  investigate the effect of various initialization methods on the  final solution produced by the EM algorithm.  The initializations  that we consider are (1) parameters sampled from an uninformative  prior.  (2) random perturbations of the marginal distribution of the  data, and (3) the output of agglomerative clustering.  Although the  methods are substantially different, they lead to learned models  that are similar in quality.  (Author abstract) 18 Refs.

Title: Estimation of trends in the scram rate at nuclear power plants
Abstract: An important task of the U.S.  Nuclear Regulatory Commission is to  examine annual operating data from the nation's population of  nuclear power plants for trends over time.  We are interested here in trends in the scram rate at 66 commercial nuclear power plants based on annual observed scram data from 1984-1993.  For an assumed Poisson distribution on the number of unplanned scrams, a gamma prior, and  an appropriate hyperprior, a parametric empirical Bayes (PEB)  approximation to a full hierarchical Bayes formulation is used to  estimate the scram rate for each plant for each year.  The  PEB-estimated prior and posterior distributions are then  subsequently smoothed over time using an exponentially weighted  moving average.  The results indicate that such bidirectional  shrinkage is quite useful for identifying reliability trends over  time.  (Author abstract) 29 Refs.

Title: Impact of unidentified location effects on dispersion-effects  identification from unreplicated factorial designs
Abstract: There have been several publications on identifying dispersion  effects from an unreplicated fractional or full factorial  experiment.  Some of these methods implicitly assume that unknown  location effects are first identified correctly from the data.  In  practice, however, an empirical location-effects identification  procedure may leave some small to moderate location effects  undetected.  It is shown in this study that such unidentified  location effects can cumulatively impair subsequent  dispersion-effects identification.  Numerical evidence based on a  welding experiment and results from a simulation study are provided.  A mathematical explanation of the impact of unidentified location  effects on dispersion-effects identification is given.  The  dispersion-effects identification methods initially proposed for  unreplicated data can be naturally extended to replicated  experiments with the impact of unidentified location effects  eliminated.  A fluorescent-lamp experiment is analyzed to illustrate  these methods.  (Author abstract) 23 Refs.

Title: Optimization of spectral performances of the XMM-EPIC MOS camera  systems; Event selection and energy reconstruction schemes tested on calibration data
Abstract: Ground calibrations have been completed in 1998 on the MOS-CCD focal  planes of the European Photon Imaging Cameras (EPIC) of the X-ray  Multi-Mirror (XMM) mission.  The cameras have been calibrated as a  whole, including the digital treatment performed in the EPIC MOS  Controller (EMCR), where events are selected according to a library  of preset patterns and some of their parameters saved for ground off line reconstruction.  This paper presents results of the calibration  data analysis about the X-ray event selection as a function of the  EMCR configuration parameters and the X-ray event energy  reconstruction on the pattern basis.  Spectral performances of the  cameras as well as the background rejection are presented as a  function of the reconstruction scheme adopted.  (Author abstract) 5  Refs.

Title: Data compression through adaptive Huffman coding scheme
Abstract: A number of data compression techniques have been introduced to  reduce the text/data storage and transmission costs.  This paper  describes the development of a data compression system that employs  adaptive Huffman method for generating variable-length codes.   Construction of the tree is discussed for gathering latest  information about the entered message.  The encoder process of the  system encodes frequently occurring characters with shorter bit  codes and infrequently appearing characters with longer bit codes.   Adaptive, sibling, swapping, escape code, and re-scaling mechanisms  of the model are briefly explained as they are extremely useful in  enhancing compression efficiency.  The decoder process expands the  encoded text back to the original text and works very much like the  encoder process.  Experimental results are tabulated which  demonstrate that the developed system is very effective for  compressing database files (provides compression ratio up to 52.51%) in a real-time environment.

Title: Query Processing for selection and projection using inverted  partitioned indexes
Abstract: Very large data volumes and reading data from different information  sources and updating data in local information sources make the  traditional indexing technique such as Record Identification (RID)  index is unsuitable for data warehouses.  Bitmap indexes are  promising technique to replace RID in selection level of query  processing.  In our paper, we introduced other variant of an inverted partitioned index that materializes the frequently portion secondary key of base relation to store primary key instead of RID.  Query  Processing for selection and projection using an Inverted  Partitioned Index can process relevant data in the index level  without going through the base relation.  We use a disk page as  criteria to analysis an inverted partitioned index with related  techniques such as full scan, RID index and Bitmap Index.  Our new  variant of inverted partitioned indexes is much better than related  techniques.  (Author abstract) 8 Refs.

Title: Integrating modelling and data analysis in teaching discrete event  simulation
Abstract: The growing popularity of stochastic discrete event simulation in  areas such as telecommunication, combined with much marketing hype  about ease of use, has coaxed some practitioners into a misguided  belief that choosing prefabricated components from libraries and  configuring them into a model by pointing and clicking is all that  is needed.  While neglect of statistical aspects of simulation has  already led to some highly problematic published results, this  erroneous assumption must also be guarded against in university  teaching.  This paper therefore argues for the importance of teaching those issues that critically affect the analysis and credibility of  a simulation's results alongside those methods and tools targeted at the needs of model design and construction.

Title: Evaluation of the thermal conductivity of porous silicon layers by an optical pump-probe method
Abstract: Measurements of the thermal conductivity for free-standing porous  silicon layers were performed by means of an optical pump-probe  experimental set-up.  By transient heating due to laser pumping, a  refractive index modulation was induced in the sample and, solving  the heat propagation equation for inside the solid film, it is shown that the time decay of the nonlinear transmittance can be related to the thermal conductivity.  The optical technique demonstrated here is contactless, quite simple and does not require much effort in data  analysis, and is therefore very useful for thin-film  characterization.  The thermal conductivities of the porous silicon  samples, whose porosities lay in the range 60-70%, were taken into  account, and we found good agreement with results obtained with  different techniques.

Title: Visualization of multivariate data with radial plots using SAS
Abstract: Data visualization tools can provide very powerful information and  insight when performing data analysis.  In many situations, a set of  data can be adequately analyzed through data visualization methods  alone.  In other situations, data visualization can be used for  preliminary data analysis.  In this paper, radial plots are developed as a SAS-based data visualization tool that can improve one's  ability to monitor, analyze and control a process.  Using the program developed in this research, we present two examples of data analysis using radial plots; the first example is based on data from a  particle board manufacturing process and the second example is a  business process for monitoring the time-varying level of stock  return data. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract: Schafer Corporation and Stanford University's Space Systems  Development Laboratory (SSDL) were awarded a contract in August,  2000 by the NRO Office of Space Launch to investigate new,  revolutionary approaches to facilitate low-cost space technology  demonstrations.  The Schafer Team is developing approaches that can  restore the timelines and risk-acceptance environment necessary to  stimulate innovation for space technology development programs.  We  are proactively matching a critical category of payload developers  with space launch services: the new/innovative developers of space  component technology that do not have the knowledge, resources, or  contacts necessary to successfully test their technologies in space.  Restoration and expansion of the U.S.  Space industry's innovative  foundations must include rapid access to space for testing of new  ideas and must be closely coupled to hands-on university programs in space technologies that will train future generations of US space  technologists.  This paper addres ses an innovative technology "pull" approach to achieving these objectives.  4 Refs.

Title: Establishing ultra-reliability by fault injection experiments
Abstract: A validation procedure combines field data, arguments-from-design,  and fault injection experiments to demonstrate high reliability.   This paper covers integrating these elements and deriving results  that reduce the fault injection effort.  A typical argument about the impossibility of demonstrating ultra reliability by experiment is  presented to motivate the emphasis on reducing the experimental  effort.  An example is used to explain the integration of field data, fault injection, arguments-from-design, and performance monitoring.   This validation procedure has stringent requirements, but it is  shown that these requirements are common to other procedures.  There  is an extended analysis on number, type, and time of fault  occurrence.  These results are applied to a system with an extremely  high reliability requirement.  They reduce the experimental effort to a moderate level.  2 Refs.

Title: Concurrent storm damage data collection by high altitude airborne  IFSAR
Abstract: This paper discusses the use of high altitude airborne  interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IFSAR) operations for  concurrent severe storm damage data collection.  The primary storm  damage observable is changes in surface topography induced by storm  effects.  The surface topography in form of a digital surface matrix  (DSM) derived from concurrent IFSAR operations is compared to an  archived DSM collected prior to the storm.  Information on storm  damage is developed from analysis of DSM changes.  Combined with a-  priori photo and radar imagery, the technique provides means for  detection, location, quantification and characterization of storm  damage.  The paper discusses limitations to the concept due primarily to radar signal propagation effects.  Results of simulations of IFSAR measured surface topography changes are presented.  6 Refs.

Title: Geo-location using synthetic maps
Abstract: Geo-location of an overhead remote sensor field of view using  synthetic earth scenes is shown.  Synthetic sensor scenes ("maps")  combine an earth datum, digital terrain elevation data, and Landsat  scenes in the viewing geometry.  The collected satellite image is  correlated with a corresponding map to yield pixel lat/long  coordinates on the earth.  Errors are estimated based on scene  structure, viewing geometry, and sensor "state of health".  Daytime  visible band scenes of land-water interfaces and mountainous terrain in cloud-free 200 multiplied by 200 pixel scenes with point spread  functions of 2 to 3 pixels have been studied initially.  Geolocation  to date has yielded corrections of less than 5 pixels to dead  reckoning boresights with residual errors of 0.5 pixels.  The method  will be applied to a large ensemble of collections and will be  extended to nighttime collects in infrared bands.  12 Refs.

Title: Non-linear preprocessing of heavy tailed reverberation
Abstract: Echolocation in shallow water is often characterized by high spurious detection rates generated by heavy tailed (impulse like) boundary  reverberation.  While persistent echos that are delay/Doppler  consistent over several interrogations are best detected and left to a subsequent classifier stage, impulsive transient events in the  time series can be suppressed by preprocessing the data stream with  a nonlinear filter.  A simple preprocessor consisting of a linear  predictor with a thresholded non-linearity has been used to  attenuate sporadic impulse like events and successfully reduce the  heavy pdf tails of synthesized Rayleigh mixture reverberation  matched to actual data.  It is shown that the preprocessor was able  to restore nearly all of the ROC performance of a matched filter and reduce the false alarm yet maintain the detection rate when applied  to real data from a sallow water rocky bottom area.  7 Refs.

Title: The relationship between Ground data systems and flight operations  for the Aura project TES Instrument
Abstract: While Ground Data systems are normally thought of primarily in terms  of processors of Science and Calibration data, they are also used by Instrument Operations teams.  This paper briefly outlines Aura's  Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) experiment and TES  Instrument Operations activities.  It describes the data used to  trend the health, status, and performance of the TES instrument,  which are routed to the TES Instrument Operations Team (IOT) by the  Ground Data system..  TES is atypical in that it has some engineering data that are available only in the high rate data stream, rather  than in low-rate engineering data.  Blocks of commands to perform  anticipated TES tasks were developed in parallel with TES flight  software design.  This paper concludes by showing how this early  development of command blocks permitted significantly more  flexibility in resolving a variety of TES Operations issues.  3 Refs.

Title: The effect of faults on plasma particle detector data reduction
Abstract: Missions in NASA's Solar-Terrestrial Probe line feature challenges  such as multiple spacecraft and high data production rates.  An  important class of scientific instruments that have for years  strained against limits on communications are the particle detectors used to measure space plasma density, temperature, and flow.  The  Plasma Moment Application (PMA) software is being developed for the  NASA Remote Exploration & Experimentation (REE) Program's series of  Flight Processor Testbeds.  REE seeks to enable instrument science  teams to move data analyses such as PMA on board the spacecraft  thereby reducing communication downlink requirements.  Here we  describe the PMA for the first time and examine its behavior under  single bit faults in its static state.  We find that similar to 90%  of the faults lead to tolerable behavior, while the remainder cause  either program failure or nonsensical results.  These results help  guide the development of fault tolerant, non-hardened flight/science processors.  16 Refs.

Title: Wavelet-based hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion
Abstract: Different research groups have recently studied the concept of  wavelet image fusion between panchromatic and multispectral images  using different approaches.  In this paper, a new approach using the  wavelet based method for data fusion between hyperspectral and  multispectral images is presented.  Using this wavelet concept of  hyperspectral and multispectral data fusion, we performed image  fusion between two spectral levels of a hyperspectral image and one  band of multispectral image.  The reconstructed image has a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.8 per pixel and a signal-to-noise ratio  (SNR) of 36 dB.  We achieved our goal of creating a composite image  that has the same spectral resolution as the hyperspectral image and the same spatial resolution as the multispectral image with minimum  artifacts.  11 Refs.

Title: Hyperspectral imaging in earth roads construction planning
Abstract: Some types of clay, esp. montmorillonite, become slippery when  getting wet.  Clay movement is very harmful for various constructions and can also cause trouble for both wheeled and tracked vehicles in  military operations at some rural areas when raining.  We present a  summary of a project using hyperspectral imaging in assisting earth  roads construction planning and cross-country trafficability  analysis.  Spectral signature libraries are used to help identify  materials and define those areas to be avoided, which have  significant montmorillonite content.  We perform a case study in this kind of application; some methods of data processing and analyzing  are discussed.  We also discussed the problems we met in this  application.  Hyperspectral sensing is a relatively new but mature  technology; development of applications and corresponding analyzing  procedures will be the major impetus of this technology.  13 Refs.

We have tested the algorithm in two different CPU  architectures (SPARC and Intel) and four different configurations  including a Beowulf cluster, two Sun clusters and a symmetric  multiprocessor.  The experiments provide a good speedup in all the  cases and show a very good performance/price ratio in the PC-Linux  cluster.  We present results using a three channel, high resolution  original dataset in times less than two minutes in the best cases  and we use the segmented maps to make clinically relevant 3D  visualizations in interactive times.  12 Refs.

Title: Adaptive view synthesis for aliasing artifact reduction
Abstract: In recent years, the scan speed of computed tomography (CT) has  increased significantly.  Not long ago, the state-of-the-art CT was  only capable of completing a single scan in 1.0s per gantry  rotation.  Nowadays, 0.5s per revolution is nearly an industry  standard.  Faster scan speeds demand faster sampling of the  projections to combat aliasing artifacts, and higher x-ray tube  output to ensure sufficient x-ray photon flux delivered to the scan.  These demands often exceed the technological capability of these  components.  In this paper we performed a detailed analysis on the  characteristics of the view aliasing artifact.  Based on our analysis and clinical observations, we propose an adaptive view synthesis  (AVS) scheme that effectively reduces the demands on the data  acquisition system.  Detailed performance comparison between the full view sampling and the adaptive view synthesis are performed through  computer simulations and phantom experiments.  Our analysis indicates that AVS is adequate for routine clinical applications.  21 Refs.

Title: Innovative data collection techniques for roadside origin-destination surveys
Abstract: Described are the results of a pilot application intended to automate the data collection and data reduction phases of roadside  origin-destination (O-D) studies.  Most techniques used to obtain O-D data are quite labor intensive, during both the data collection and  the data reduction phase.  Frequently, they result in extensive data  quality checks and long turn-around periods between the data  collection work and the submittal of the corresponding survey  report.  The application described automates the data collection and  data reduction phases by using portable, handheld data collection  devices.  These devices can be connected to a desktop or laptop  computer to transfer the O-D data to a depository database.  Included are a brief background discussion, a description of the hardware and software used and the design and development of O-D applications, a  description of two applications of the handheld data collection  devices, and a list of lessons learned.  6 Refs.

Title: Case study of potential ground-borne vibration reductions from  targeted maintenance of subway cars
Abstract: An extensive vibration survey was conducted on Red Line trains of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.  Vibration from 420  individual train passages was recorded in the tunnel under the  Beacon Hill neighborhood in Boston.  A statistical model was  developed to characterize the distribution of vibration levels in  the fleet.  Detailed vibration time histories showed that specific  train cars could be identified by their vibration signature,  offering a method by which maintenance could be targeted on the  worst vibration offenders in the fleet.  The statistical fleet model  was used to predict the effectiveness of a targeted maintenance  program as measured by the potential reduction in the maximum and  average fleet vibration levels.  A targeted maintenance program was  found to reduce the maximum Red Line vibration levels by 4.5 dBV  (vibration level in decibels).  1 Refs.

Title: Domain distributed intelligent processing for information fuselets
Abstract: The best solution for one intelligent information fusion design is  obviously domain specific and not universal.  This is especially true in multidisciplinary design domains of information systems at higher clock speeds where the need arises to distribute the intelligent  processing requirements between the digital circuit elements and  their real world interconnects in the mixed-signal sensor domain.  In this paper we propose the distribution of intelligent processing, or fuselets by three levels of information fusion.  These are;  perception, fuselets, processing algorithms and neural nets.  The  proposed robust design methodology for these multidisciplinary  levels, involves the blending of the s-domain (continuous) and  z-domain (digital), resulting in the wp-domain (mixed-signal)  models.  The advantage of using the wp-domain bilinear transformation for mixed-signal design is the ability to handle the discrete  portion of the design like a continuous system, thus unifying the  design process for domain distributed intelligent processing  systems.  7 Refs.

Title: Indoor radon level in the dwellings of the Rajshahi and Chuadanga  regions of Bangladesh
Abstract: The indoor radon level in terms of equilibrium equivalent  concentration (EEC) has been measured for dwellings in the Rajshahi  region of Bangladesh as well as its adjoining Chuadanga region.  The  data were obtained using the passive time integrated method  employing LR-115 (Type II) solid state nuclear track detectors.  The  geometric mean value for the EEC in the dwellings located in the  Rajshahi region was obtained as 32.4 plus or minus 7.1 Bq m**-**3  and for the dwellings in the Chuadanga region was obtained as 27.3  plus or minus 6.2 Bq m**-**3.  The data obtained in the present work  are compared with indoor radon levels prescribed by the  International Commission on Radiation Protection. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: A structural genomics pilot project based on gene targets selected  from Escherichia coli
Abstract: A pilot project based on gene targets selected from the genome of E.   coli has been initiated with 38 genes for initial cloning.  Of these, 18 proteins have been purified to date and some crystals were  obtained for twelve of them.  Of these, four proteins yielded  crystals diffracting to a sufficiently high resolution to warrant  structural investigation.  We have determined 3-D structures of three of these proteins using Se-Met labeling and MAD methods, while the  structure of the fourth one was simultaneously determined by another group.  To manage the parallel work on many proteins by several  researchers it became necessary to create a searchable database  containing the pertinent information about every stage of the work.   copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Direct simulation of apex enhancement on the flux onto European  Retrievable Carrier
Abstract: The extended direct simulation Monte Carlo method is employed to  model fluxes of meteoroid and space debris onto surfaces of the  sun-pointing spacecraft European Retrievable Carrier.  Apex  enhancement of the Earth motion on flux is considered by including a parameter to describe the anisotropic velocity directionality in the meteoroid distribution.  The anisotropy of the measured fluxes onto  different surfaces is well explained by this approach, and results  are consistent with measured data.  Also, the effect of the apex  enhancement of the Earth motion on the morphology of the impacts is  analyzed, and a good agreement with measured data is achieved.  Our  simulation allows an estimation of the extent to which the  directionality distribution of the meteoroid velocity unit vectors  deviates from the isotropic distribution.  21 Refs.

Title: Validation of in situ ionospheric density measurements with  ground-based radar
Abstract: The in situ sensors aboard spacecraft of the Defense Meteorological  Satellite Program routinely measure top-side ionospheric ion  densities near 840 km.  This report presents data that demonstrate  that the satellite ion density measurements are accurate.  This  verification is done by comparing the ion densities determined by  the thermal plasma instrument with plasma densities determined by  the incoherent scatter radar station at Millstone Hill, Westford,  Massachusetts.  The radar measurements were obtained at nearly the  same location and same time as the satellite measurements and are  completely independent of the satellite observations.  This report  describes the collection and comparison of the radar and spacecraft  data for the years 1989 and 1991.  The principal result of the study  is that ion densities determined by the spacecraft differ from radar plasma densities by less than 10%.  7 Refs.

Title: Trip-generation characteristics for convenience stores
Abstract: A study was carried out to determine if the trip-generation  characteristics of convenience stores are different than those for  the older convenience stores with gasoline contained in Land Use  Code 853 of Trip Generation.  The study sites included seven stores  in Pennsylvania, seven stores in Virginia, five stores in Delaware,  five stores in New Jersey and four stores in Maryland.   Trip-generation data were collected at the driveways for entering  and exiting movements.  Analysis of the data revealed that these  sites have different generation characteristics from the smaller  convenience stores with gas.  The trip-generation rates for new-style convenience stores are greater in the a.m. peak hour than the  existing Trip Generation rates using both building area and number  of fueling positions as the independent variable.

Title: Competing ferro- and antiferromagnetism in R//2CuIn//3 (R = Tb, Ho,  Er) intermetallics studied by neutron diffraction and magnetization  measurements
Abstract: Ternary R//2CuIn//3 (R = Tb, Ho, Er) intermetallics were investigated by means of neutron diffraction and low-temperature susceptibility  measurements.  The Tb and Ho samples exhibit antiferromagnetic (AF)  behavior with T//o//r//d= 33 plus or minus 1 and 9K, respectively,  while the Er compound reveals peculiar almost re-entrant spin glass  (RSG) characteristics with a critical temperature T//c//r//i//t =  12K and a broad maximum at T//o//r//d = 9 plus or minus 1K.  Neutron  diffraction profiles at 3.8 K confirm collinear AF order only for  Tb//2CuIn//3 with a magnetic moment mu//(//3//.//8// //K//) = 6.8  mu//B/Tb**3**+ localized on the R ions only and aligned along the  c-axis.  The absence of any long-range order in the Ho and Er  compounds may be attributed to local spin disorder and dynamical  spin fluctuations.  Spinglass-like states, cannot be excluded when  the structural disorder on the 2d site, introduced by the  statistical distribution of Cu and In ions, is considered. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: **2**2**6Ra measurement in Mo, Cd and Nd//2O//3 samples with the  emanation method
Abstract: Measurements of **2**2**6Ra content in materials and chemical  reagents used to construct the double beta decay sources in the  NEMO-3 experiment have been done with the emanation method  technique.  Three different radon emanation technologies were used in these studies.  The first was the "traditional" method of dissolving  the sample.  The second was an extraction of Rn from a melted sample  and finally a technique of heating fine-grained powder was used.  It  is shown that there is good agreement of the data received with the  emanation method and low background high purity germanium detectors.  The sensitivity of this method is 0.02 mBq/l of solution (for the  "standard" emanation method) or 0.02 mBq/kg (for methods in which  radon is extracted from a powder or melt).  11 Refs.

Title: An alternate model for cylindrical data
Abstract: Cylindrical data is a form of bivariate directional data, where one  component is measured on an angular scale and the other is linear.   This data can arise in some manufacturing applications with circular parts, such as the automotive industry with wheel, brake and engine  components.  Also, observational data of this variety exists from  meteorological and biological applications.  One common application  is wind direction coupled with some other characteristic of weather, such as temperature, wind velocity or ozone concentration.  Several  models, which all assume good spread of the angular component around the range of values, have been proposed to examine this type of  data.  Possible limitations of the models when the angular component  of the data falls in a narrow range of values are considered, and an alternate model for this case is proposed.  Strategies for choosing  between competing models based on the spread of the angular data and model fit are discussed.  7 Refs.

Title: Transformation of ellipsoid heights to local leveling heights
Abstract: The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of interpolation  methods, which are used for digital terrain modeling, in  transformation of Global Positioning System (GPS) ellipsoid heights  to local heights.  To test the interpolation methods used in this  research, a set of GPS data collected in northern Turkey, 300 km  from Istanbul, is used.  The data were transformed to a local height  system using 11 different interpolation processes, classified in  four types of interpolation approaches.  The data set includes 109  points, whose heights are known in both GPS and local height  systems.  Eighteen of them are selected as reference points.  The  differences between the local and GPS heights at the remaining 91  points were recalculated by using the differences at the 18  reference points.  The interpolated (or extrapolated) differences  were compared with the known differences for 91 points.  28 Refs.

Title: Junction properties of metal/polypyrrole Schottky barriers
Abstract: Schottky barriers of the type Au/polypyrrole/Al (or In) were made in  sandwich configuration.  The conductivity of polypyrrole was tuned to be on the order of 10**-**3 ohm**-**1 cm**-**1 by its  electrodeposition from a novel ambient temperature ternary eutectic  melt consisting of acetamide, urea, and ammonium nitrate.  The  rectification characteristics were obtained from the current-voltage and capacitance-voltage measurements at room temperature.  The  analysis of data using thermionic emission theory gave improved  values for the junction parameters of ideality factor, reverse  saturation current, rectification ratio, and barrier potential when  compared to the previously reported values for this polymer.  Between Al and In metals used for the junction formation, the diode formed  with Al metal is found to show better performance.  The energy gap  and work function of polypyrrole were also estimated. copy 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.  J Appl Polym Sci.  35 Refs.

Title: Analysis of orthogonal array experiments using the multivariate  orthogonal regression method
Abstract: In this article, a multivariate orthogonal regression method is  presented for analyzing the data of orthogonal array experiments.  It is based on fitting the data with an orthogonal polynomial  regression model by using the least squares method.  The proposed  method can obtain the same statistically testing results as that of  the conventional method.  In addition, the regression model can be  used to determine the optimum combination of levels.  Compared to the discrete-type conditions determined by the conventional method, the  proposed method can produce the continuous-type conditions of  optimum combination of levels.  The regression model can also be used for prediction, process optimization, and process control.  A  numerical example is included to illustrate the procedure.  10 Refs.

Title: A multi agent system for monitoring industrial gas turbine start-up  sequences
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel technique for condition monitoring of  gas turbine start up sequences.  The vast amount of data and the  complex processes behind on-line fault detection indicate the need  for an automated solution.  A multi agent system that views the  problem as the interaction of simple independent software entities,  for effective use of the available data, is presented.  The overall  solution is derived from the combination of partial solutions  provided by the components of the multi-agent system.  As a  consequence, data interpretation is achieved by converting the data  into appropriate information and combining individual agents'  information, resulting in an automatic fault diagnosis for the  engineers.  This multi-agent system can employ various intelligent  system techniques and has been implemented using the ZEUS Agent  Building Toolkit.  12 Refs.

Title: Estimation of parameters for fault diagnosis in bilinear system
Abstract: The parameter estimation was applied to the fault diagnosis in  bilinear system by the consistency observability of the bilinear  system, which can be described by input and output series and  transformed into the linear function of the system parameters.  The  real-time characteristics and accuracy of this method are good  enough for the parameter estimation of bilinear system.  If a fault  occurs after the system has worked normally for some time, robust  fault diagnosis is achievable with the system by parameter  estimation.  When a fault is caused by the change in parameters, the  changing parameters can be quickly and accurately identified.   (Edited abstract) 5 Refs.

Abstract: The 32-channel Amplifier/Discriminator Board (ADB) has been designed  for Mini-Drift Tubes (MDTs) used for upgrading the DO Forward Angle  Muon System (FAMUS) (Fermilab, Batavia, USA).  The ADB signal  channels are formed by eight ASICs: four transresistance amplifiers, Ampl-8.3, and four comparators, Disc-8.3.  The ADB provides operation with adjustable threshold currents 0.5-5.0muA.  Low noise (60nA at  maximal MDT capacitance 60pF) and small firing current dispersion  provide the ability for detector robust performance at low levels of anode high voltage (below 3.4kV).

Abstract: There are five features in this approach: 1. The complete nonlinear  dynamics of the pursuit-evasion motion is considered in  three-dimensional spherical coordinate system.  Neither linearization nor small signal assumptions are made.  2. The nonlinear H-infinity  guidance design is derived analytically and expressed in a very  simple form.  3. Unlike adaptive control concept, implementation of  the proposed H// infinity guidance design does not need the  information on target acceleration while ensuring acceptable  intercept performance for arbitrary targets with the finite  acceleration.  4. The derived guidance design exhibits strong  robustness against variations in target acceleration.  5. Finally the issues related to the validation of the control law using Hardware  In The Loop simulation are presented.  The effects of the Flight  Motion Simulator static and dynamic accuracies (time delay etc...)  are discussed.  6 Refs.

Title: Autonomous motion controller design using genetic algorithms
Abstract: This paper presents an evolutional compensator design for motion  control systems using Genetic Algorithms (GA).  The control system is composed of a robust 2-Degrees-Of-Freedom (2DOF) compensator based  on the co-prime factorization description.  The structural design and parameterization for the compensator essentially requires  complicated theoretical and numerical procedures to realize the  given control specifications.  In this research, an autonomous design approach is proposed, where the optimal compensator structure and  its parameters can be autonomously determined to satisfy the  specified motion control performance by the optimization ability of  GA, paying particular attention to the system robustness against  load disturbances and variation of mechanical parameters.  The  effectiveness of the proposed compensator design has been verified  by experimental results using prototype.  8 Refs.

Title: Tension control for winding systems with two degrees of freedom H//  infinity controller
Abstract: The plant considered in this paper is a web transport system with  winder, traction motor and unwinder.  Transport system dynamics  change dramatically due to the wide variation in roll radii and  inertia.  The effect of these changes is reduced by gain scheduling  control.  Industrial systems typically use decentralized PID  controllers.  In this paper we present multivariable H// infinity  robust control with two degrees of freedom and gain scheduling.  This controller significantly improves disturbance rejection performance  and significantly reduces coupling between web tension and velocity.  Performances of this controller and classical H// infinity  controllers are compared.  20 Refs.

Title: Robust state-feedback H// infinity control of a nonlinear two-mass  system
Abstract: In this paper a positioning control of a nonlinear elastically  coupled two-mass system is presented.  Structures of two-mass systems can often be found e.g. in robotics or machine tools.  The contained  mechanical parts, like gears and shafts, can lead to limited cycles  and stick-slip effects.  In order to avoid the unwanted effects an  H// infinity control design is used for the system.  In the control  parameter uncertainties and elastic torsion are also taken into  account.  In the standard H// infinity control structure a basic  change is needed.  This leads to a state-feedback H// infinity  control.  The result is a linear H// infinity control, that can  handle the nonlinear system.  The control shows good dynamics,  robustness and can handle disturbances.  Measured results are shown  in this paper.  12 Refs.

Title: Modeling and robust adaptive control of a 3-axis motion simulator
Abstract: In this paper, the development of a 3-axis motion simulator is  described.  The simulator is used to test and calibrate certain  spacecraft instruments within a hardware-in-the-loop environment.  A  mathematical electromechanical model of the simulator is developed.   Moreover, a novel robust adaptive nonlinear control law for the  simulator is developed based on Lyapunov stability theory.  The  controller can be made adaptable to constant unknown parameters as  well as robust to unknown but bounded fast varying disturbances.  The motion simulator actuators are Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor  (PMSM) drives.  The simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the efficacy of the proposed control system and the  validity of the mathematical model of the simulator.  13 Refs.

Title: Robustness based loop tuning
Abstract: Robustness, discussed in this paper as degree of stability, is a  critically important control loop property.  Robustness of control  loop tuning determines the range of acceptable operation for the  control loop and must be considered in conjunction with performance  objectives such as regulatory and setpoint response.  Interaction of  performance and robustness can make loop tuning difficult and  tedious.  This paper describes a tuning method whereby robustness is  selected and tuning parameters are returned, together with a  presentation of performance, reversing the normal procedure.   Discussed is the mathematical and logical development of a  robustness map presentation and, how it can be combined with  simulation and loop auto-tuning facilities to create a highly  informative, yet simple approach to robustness based loop tuning.  3  Refs.

Title: Predictive controller robustness testing through dynamic simulation
Abstract: An extensive theoretical framework exists to calculate the stability  of single loop controllers.  However, many plant process control  problem involve not only keeping variables at their targets, but  also preventing the process from exceeding constraints.  This has  increasingly led to the adoption of constrained multivariable  predictive controllers.  These approaches cast the control problem as the solution of an optimization problem.  The disadvantage is that in the absence of an explicit expression for the closed loop control  law, it is difficult to analyze the stability and robustness of the  controller.  This paper describes how the use of rigorous dynamic  simulation can help deliver superior results.  9 Refs.

Title: Jitter-based delay-boundary prediction of wide-area networks
Abstract: The delay-boundary prediction algorithms currently implemented by  transport protocols are lowpass filters based on autoregressive and  moving average (ARMA) models.  However, recent studies have revealed  a fractal-like structure of delay sequences, which may not be well  suited to ARMA models.  In this paper, we propose a novel  delay-boundary prediction algorithm based on a deviation-lag  function (DLF) to characterize end-to-end delay variations.  Compared to conventional algorithms derived from ARMA models, the new  algorithm can adapt to delay variations more rapidly and share  delay's robust high-order statistical information (jitter deviation) among competing connections along a common network path.  Preliminary experiments show that it outperforms Jacobson's algorithm, which is  based on an ARMA model, by significantly reducing the prediction  error rate.  To show the practical feasibility of the DLF algorithm,  we also propose a skeleton implementation model.  17 Refs.

Title: Experimental quantification of soliton robustness to polarization  mode dispersion in conventional and dispersion-managed systems
Abstract: We have experimentally quantified the soliton robustness to  polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in both conventional and  dispersion-managed (DM) soliton systems.  Long-term measurements were performed in a computer-controlled system where the PMD  characteristics varied randomly with time.  Apart from the PMD  itself, the performance of both systems depends on the average  dispersion while the performance of the DM system also depends on  the dispersion map strength.  The results show that the robustness  can be even more pronounced for DM systems with relatively small  dispersion map strengths (0 less than S less than 10), compared with conventional systems (S = 0), which is an effect of the increased  power requirements.  The experiments were also compared with  numerical simulations.  20 Refs.

Title: Global chaos synchronization and robust filtering in noisy context
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of global chaos synchronization is  addressed.  Two propositions borrowed from results of the robust  control theory are established to get global synchronization of  piecewise-linear dynamical systems in an observer configuration.   They are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities.  One  proposition enables the computation of the observer gain matrix  which ensures global synchronization with a predetermined transient  time called rate of convergence.  The second one enables the  computation of the observer gain matrix ensuring the minimization of the influence of disturbances in a noisy context leading to a  so-called robust filtering.  In the same time, propositions give  conditions on the structure of the generator to obtain  synchronization.  Comparisons of performances are pointed out through a numerical example.  They clearly highlight the efficiency of robust filtering.  16 Refs.

Title: A robust control strategy for shunt and series reactive compensators  to damp electromechanical oscillations
Abstract: This paper examines the enhancement of power system stability  properties by use of thyristor controlled series capacitors (TCSCs)  and static var systems (SVCs).  Models suitable for incorporation in  dynamic simulation programs used to study angle stability are  analyzed.  A control strategy for damping of electromechanical power  oscillations using an energy function method is derived.  Using this  control strategy each device (TCSC and SVC) will contribute to the  damping of power swings without deteriorating the effect of the  other power oscillation damping (POD) devices.  The damping effect is robust with respect to loading condition, fault location and network structure.  Furthermore, the control inputs are based on local  signals.  The effectiveness of the controls are demonstrated for  model power systems.  21 Refs.

Title: Nonlinear fly-by-throttle H// infinity control using neural networks
Abstract: A neural network approach to gain scheduling H// infinity controllers for propulsion controlled aircraft (PCA) systems is introduced.  The  PCA system is applied to backup control of aircraft experiencing  control surface failure.  The H// infinity technology is applied to  the problem of matching the crippled aircraft and the nominal model.  Various H// infinity controllers at various flight conditions are  used to train radial basis function networks (RBEN), which can then  be used as the nonlinear controller.  Simulation on an L-1011 under  fly-by-throttle control demonstrates that the RBFN controller can  stabilize the crippled airplane to obtain the desired model and  possesses robustness against the engine delay.  14 Refs.

Title: Robust adaptive control of robots using neural network: Global  stability
Abstract: A desired compensation adaptive law-based neural network (DCAL-NN)  controller is proposed for the robust position control of rigid-link robots.  The NN is used to approximate a highly nonlinear function.   The controller can guarantee the global asymptotic stability of  tracking errors and boundedness of NN weights.  In addition, the NN  weights here are tuned on-line, with no off-line-learning phase  required.  When compared with standard adaptive robot controllers, we do not require linearity in the parameters, or lengthy and tedious  preliminary analysis to determine a regression matrix.  The  controller can be regarded as a universal reusable controller  because the same controller can be applied to any type of rigid  robots without any modifications.  A comparative simulation study  with different robust and adaptive controllers is included.  21 Refs.

Title: Fault-tolerant control of linear systems with uncertainties
Abstract: A new design method for robust fault-tolerant controller of an  uncertain linear system was put forward by using H// infinity robust control results.  When some sensor and actuator are fault within a  pre-specified subset of sensors and actuators, have the plant  disturbance and measurement noise, and the uncertainties of the  system are of norm bounded, a robust fault tolerant controller is  designed by constructing an auxiliary system without uncertainties  in the term of positive define solution of Hamilton-Jacobi  inequalities(HJIs).  The controller is not only integrity against  sensor and actuator fault, but also robustness in the presence of  plant disturbance and measurement noise, and guarantees the robust  asymptotic stability and H// infinity performance of the close loop  system.  The controller presents a new way to solve fault tolerant  robust control problem of the linear system with uncertainties.  10  Refs.

Title: Robust stability and performance of stochastic uncertain systems on  an infinite time interval
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a robust stability problem for continuous  time stochastic uncertain systems.  The uncertainty in the system is  characterized in terms of an uncertain probability distribution on  the noise input.  This uncertainty is assumed to satisfy a certain  relative entropy constraint.  The solution to a specially  parametrized risk-sensitive performance analysis problem is used to  estimate the level of guaranteed performance for the stochastic  uncertain system under consideration.  This solution is obtained by  solving an algebraic Riccati equation.  The corresponding performance bound holds for all admissible uncertainties and is nonconservative. copy Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: A new controller architecture for high performance, robust, and  fault-tolerant control
Abstract: In this note, we propose a new feedback controller architecture.  The  distinguished feature of our new controller architecture is that it  shows structurally how the controller design for performance and  robustness may be done separately which has the potential to  overcome the conflict between performance and robustness in the  traditional feedback framework.  The controller architecture includes two parts: one part for performance and the other part for  robustness.  The controller architecture works in such a way that the feedback control system will be solely controlled by the performance controller when there is no model uncertainties and external  disturbances and the robustification controller will only be active  when there are model uncertainties or external disturbances.  21  Refs.

Title: An H// infinity design approach for neural net-based control schemes
Abstract: This note presents an H// infinity design approach for a neural  net-based control scheme.  In this scheme, a class of nonlinear  systems is approximated by two multilayer perceptrons.  The neural  networks are piecewisely interpolated to generate a linear  differential inclusion model.  Based on this model, a state feedback  control law is designed.  The H// infinity control is specified to  eliminate the effect of approximation errors and external  disturbances to achieve desired performance.  It is shown that  finding the permissible control gain matrices can be transformed to  a standard linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem and solved using  the convex optimization method.  14 Refs.

Title: Local optimization algorithm for computing 2-D optical-flow field of  heart-echocardiograph image using Zernike moment
Abstract: This paper presents a local optimization algorithm for computation of 2-D optical-flow field aiming at the specialty of  heart-echocardiograph image.  We analyze several advantages of  Zernike moments such as orthogonality and rotation-invariance, and  demonstrate that Zernike moments are superior in representing the  local motion invariance in heart-echocardiograph image.  Accordingly, we generalize the premise of traditional Optical Flow Computation  that intensity is invariant in the sequence to the invariance of  each order Zernike moment.  In addition, in virtue of the computation of whole contribution of the neighborhood around each pixel, Zernike moment based method can greatly reduce the influence of a singular  error at one pixel on the total representative, therefore improves  the robustness of the algorithm.  4 Refs.

Title: A smooth Lyapunov function from a class-KL estimate involving two  positive semidefinite functions
Abstract: We consider differential inclusions where a positive semidefinite  function of the solutions satisfies a class-KL estimate in terms of  time and a second positive semidefinite function of the initial  condition.  We show that a smooth converse Lyapunov function, i.e.,  one whose derivative along solutions can be used to establish the  class-KL estimate, exists if and only the class-KL estimate is  robust, i.e., it holds for a larger, perturbed differential  inclusion.  It remains an open question whether all class-KL  estimates are robust.  One sufficient condition for robustness is  that the original differential inclusion is locally Lipschitz.   Another sufficient condition is that the two positive semidefinite  functions agree and a backward completability condition holds.  These special cases unify and generalize many results on converse Lyapunov theorems for differential equations and differential inclusions that have appeared in the literature.  42 Refs.

Title: Application of adaptive predictive control to a floor heating system  with a large thermal lag
Abstract: This paper describes an improved algorithm for generalised predictive control (GPC) and applies it to a floor radiant heating system in a  full-scale outdoor test-room.  The floor heating system is first  identified by means of recursive least squares techniques associated with a set of supervision rules for robust system identification.   The performance of the floor heating system controlled by GPC,  on-off and PI controllers is then evaluated through computer  simulations, using the identified models.  Experimental results show  that the room temperatures predicted with the identified models  agree well with the measured data.  Simulation results demonstrate  that the behaviour of GPC is superior to the other two controllers  in terms of response speed, minimum offset and on-off cycling  frequency. copy 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Model reduction and robust control of smart structures with  parametric uncertainties
Abstract: The actively controlled smart structures should have robust stability and robust performance when structural parameters vary in a  reasonable range.  In this paper, the parametric uncertainty is  defined in a framework of quadratic inequality constraint.  This  representation of uncertainty can effectively reduce the  conservatism.  A generalized balanced truncation method for  continuous uncertain system represented by linear fractional  transformation is presented.  The model reduction method can keep the uncertainty information of the full order system in the reduced  order model for robust controller design.  Linear matrix inequality  (lmi) conditions are given for designing a robust output feedback  controller to assign the poles of closed-loop uncertain system in a  constrained conic sector subregion under the input limits and  unmodeled dynamics.  The proposed method is demonstrated using an  experimental smart structure system.  12 Refs.

Title: Polarization-mode dispersion-induced outages in soliton transmission  systems
Abstract: The bit-error-rate (BER) degradation of conventional soliton systems  due to polarization-mode dispersion (PMD) is investigated.  It is  found that the interplay between the dispersive waves generated by  PMD and adjacent soliton pulses will seriously degrade the BER of  soliton systems, and make them even worse than linear systems if all other transmission impairments are neglected.  In order to achieve  soliton robustness to PMD, some techniques to eliminate or reduce  the dispersive waves must be employed, such as soliton control  methods or dispersion-managed solitons.  Different systems are  estimated and compared in terms of PMD-induced outage probability.   10 Refs.

Abstract: This paper presents a sliding-mode controller with integral  compensation for a magnetic suspension balance beam system.  The  control scheme comprises an integral controller which is designed  for achieving zero steady-state error under step disturbances, and a sliding-mode controller which is designed for enhancing robustness  under plant uncertainties.  A procedure is developed for determining  the coefficients of the switching plane such that the overall  closed-loop system has stable eigenvalues.  A proper continuous  design signal is introduced to overcome the chattering problem.  The  performance of the balance beam control system is illustrated by  simulation and experimental results which show that the proposed  integral sliding-mode controller method is effective under external  step disturbances and input channel parameter variations.  8 Refs.

Title: Neural-network control of mobile manipulators
Abstract: In this paper, a neural network (NN)-based methodology is developed  for the motion control of mobile manipulators subject to kinematic  constraints.  The dynamics of the mobile manipulator is assumed to be completely unknown, and is identified on-line by the NN estimators.   No preliminary learning stage of NN weights is required.  The  controller is capable of disturbance-rejection in the presence of  unmodeled bounded disturbances.  The tracking stability of the  closed-loop system, the convergence of the NN weight-updating  process and boundedness of NN weight estimation errors are all  guaranteed.  Experimental tests on a four-DOF manipulator arm  illustrate that the proposed controller significantly improves the  performance in comparison with conventional robust control.  20 Refs.

Title: Further results on variable output feedback controllers
Abstract: Zak and Hui [1] proposed a sliding mode  controller for linear multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems  using static output feedback.  The note in [2 right  bracket provided an improvement of the output feedback controller in [1] for a class of linear  single-input-single-output (SISO) systems that eliminated two  important limitations of [1] : (a) system  uncertainties must be bounded by the system output; and (b) a  requirement of a matrix inequality [1, eq.  (4.3) right  bracket .  The controller in [2] can  guarantee global closed-loop stability.  This note extends the  results of [2] to linear MIMO systems.  It  is emphasized that the proposed MIMO controller yields global  closed-loop stability whereas the one in [1 right  bracket can only guarantee local stability.  An application of the  proposed MIMO controller to an aircraft model is included to show  the effectiveness of the method.  10 Refs.

Title: An adaptive H** infinity tracking control for a class of nonlinear  multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems
Abstract: An adaptive H** infinity tracking control equipped with a VSC  algorithm is proposed for a class of nonlinear  multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems that are represented  by input-output models involving parametric uncertainties, unmodeled perturbations and external disturbances.  In order to counteract the  effect due to the unmodeled perturbation in the input weighting gain the H** infinity tracking control requires to solve a modified  algebraic Riccati-like matrix equation.  The derived hybrid  adaptive-robust tracking control schemes guarantee that all the  signals and states are bounded, the tracking error is uniformly  ultimately bounded and an H** infinity tracking performance is  achieved.  Compared with the conventional H** infinity tracking  control design the developed adaptive-robust H** infinity tracking  control scheme can be applied to a broader class of nonlinear MIMO  systems in the presence of high-degree uncertainties.  14 Refs.

Title: A new bounded real lemma representation for the continuous-time case
Abstract: A differential linear matrix inequality (DLMI) approach is introduced for the solution of various linear continuous-time control problems.  The proposed method permits the application of linear matrix  inequalities (LMIs) to the solution of control design problems under uncertainty.  These problems are solved for finite horizon linear  systems while considerably reducing the overdesign inherent in  previous methods.  The new approach also allows for the solution of  the output-feedback control problem for systems belonging to a  finite set of uncertain plants with hardly any overdesign.  Four  examples are given to demonstrate the applicability of the new  method.  11 Refs.

Title: Robust H// infinity filtering for a class of linear parameter-varying systems
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of H// infinity filtering  for a class of linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems in which the  state-space matrices depend affinely on time-varying parameters.  We  employ the notion of affine quadratic stability using  parameter-dependent Lyapunov functionals.  We develop a linear  parameter-dependent filter such that the estimation erorr is  affinely quadratically stable with a prescribed performance measure.  It is established that the solvability conditions can be expressed  by linear matrix inequalities which are then evaluated at the  extreme points of the admissible parameter set.  Simulation results  of a typical example are presented.  14 Refs.

Title: H// infinity control of linear discrete-time systems with  norm-bounded nonlinear uncertainties
Abstract: Robust H// infinity control of a class of discret-time uncertain  systems is discussed which contains linear nominal parts and  norm-bounded nonlinear uncertainties in both state and output  equations.  Such systems have a unique characteristic, that is, the  two norm-bounded nonlinear uncertainties have the equivalent  representation by means of time-varying and norm-bounded linear  uncertainties.  The two nonlinear uncertainty sets are considered to  be different.  Then, by converting such systems into related  discrete-time linear systems with time-varying and norm-bounded  linear uncertainties, it is obtained that a sufficient condition for robust H// infinity control of such systems is equivalent to the  solvability of the same problem of the related linear uncertain  systems, which is solvable by means of a linear algebraic Riccati  inequality.

Title: Learning-theoretic approach to model-set identification
Abstract: A new approach to model-set identification is proposed based on an  agnostic learning theory.  The squared prediction error is estimated  uniformly together with its uncertainty in some parameter region.   Based on this estimation, a model set is constructed so as to  include the best model.  The proposed approach neither requires  assumptions on the true dynamics or the noise, nor needs infinite  number of input-output data in order to justify its result.  But it  guarantees that the size of the identified model set converges to  zero as the number of input-output data increase.  Improvement of the precision is considered on the proposed identification method.   Generalization of the approach is discussed and a numerical example  is presented.  (Edited abstract) 26 Refs.

Abstract: Without explicit external and internal calibration, a nonlinear  visual mapping model for the eye-in-hand robotic visual tracking  problem is proposed, which connects the image feature space with the robotic work space tightly.  Moreover, a new visual control scheme  based on artificial neural network is designed, and the visual  tracking problem is converted into a servo problem in image feature  space.  Simulation results show that this method can drive the static tracking error to zero quickly and keep good robustness and  adaptability at the same time.  Additionally, the algorithm is very  easy to be implemented with low computational complexity.  (Edited  abstract) 11 Refs.

Title: Reduction of observation spillover in vibration suppression using a  sliding mode observer
Abstract: The objective of this study is to demonstrate that sliding mode  observers can eliminate observation spillover in the vibration  control of flexible structures.  It is common to build a state  feedback controller and a state estimator based on the mathematical  model of the system with a finite number of vibration modes, but  this may cause control and observation spillover due to the residual (uncontrolled) modes.  This paper deals with the elimination of  observation spillover using a sliding mode observer.  The performance of a sliding mode observer is compared with that of a conventional  Kalman filter to demonstrate robustness and disturbance decoupling  characteristics.  Simulation and experimental results using the  sliding mode observer are presented for active vibration control of  a cantilever beam.  17 Refs.

Title: A mathematical model and a heuristic procedure for the robust design  problem with high-low tolerances
Abstract: We introduce the concept of robust design in the context of high-low  tolerancing and propose a mathematical programming model for it.  In  situations where the transfer function is available either in closed form or through computer simulation, this model can be solved using  conventional non-linear programming techniques.  We also introduce an approximation procedure for solving this problem experimentally.   This procedure can be used in situations where either the transfer  function is not available in closed form or the variables are  discrete or categorical.  A numerical example and two case studies  from the open literature are solved using these techniques and  results are presented.  13 Refs.

Title: Research on speech distortion measure based on neural network
Abstract: This paper puts forward a novel spectrum distortion measure (MSD) of  speech based on artificial neural network (ANN).  It provides the MSD with the capability of employing subjective behavior of perception  of human auditory system, by using the theory of approaching to  nonlinear function of multilayer perceptions and radial basis  function networks.  In the application of speech quality objective  assessment, the result of subjective evaluation under plenty of  distortion conditions is directly used as the desired value of  training.  Statistic analysis shows that, comparing with traditional  Euclidian distance and weight Euclidian distance, the correlation of subjective to objective of MSD based on ANN has great improvement,  also are the reliability and robustness.  It has the property of  technological independence.  (Edited abstract) 12 Refs.

Title: Robot manipulator LPV robust H// infinity controller design based on  LMI approach
Abstract: A new approach to design robust H infinity controllers for a  two-joint direct drive planar manipulator is presented.  The  time-varying nonlinear model of robot is translated into a linear  parameter varying ( LPV) system with convex polytopic version via  the LPV convex decomposition technique.  State feedback controllers  satisfying H// infinity performance and pole placement at every  vertex of convex polyhedron parameter space are designed via linear  matrix inequalities (LMIs) approach.  Using these designed  controllers at every vertex, a LPV controller with smaller on-line  calculating capacity is synthesized via convex decomposition  techniques.  Simulation results prove that the robot with the LPV  controller has good performance as the joint angles vary.  (Edited  abstract) 9 Refs.

Title: Application of white light-emitting diode to surface plasmon  resonance sensors
Abstract: In this paper, we show that white light-emitting diode (white LED) is a viable light source for replacing the commonly-used halogen lamp  in spectral surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors.  We have  constructed an experimental setup and results obtained from  glycerin-water mixtures clearly demonstrate the systems capability  in resolving the shift in the SPR dip caused by a change in the  glycerin concentration.  The use of white LED has the obvious  benefits of direct modulation, low cost, long operation lifetime,  robustness and small size.

Title: Robust multivariable PID control for linear parameter varying systems
Abstract: Practical control problems often deal with uncertain systems  depending on parametric and possibly time-varying uncertainties.   Quadratic stability theory and recent advances in convex and  nonconvex optimisation algorithms provide useful tools to cope with  this kind of problems.  On the other hand, PID is still the  controller most commonly used for industrial problems.  In this  paper, we consider a certain class of Multi input-multi output  linear parameter varying systems which are encountered in practical  control problems and we propose a state space parameterisation which allows to convert PI and PID controller synthesis into an LMI or BMI optimisation problem.  The proposed technique guarantees uniform  exponential stability of the closed loop system, a desired rate of  convergence, and an H// infinity norm bound. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science Ltd.

Title: Nonlinear observers: A circle criterion design and robustness  analysis
Abstract: Globally convergent observers are designed for a class of systems  with monotonic nonlinearities.  The approach is to represent the  observer error system as the feedback interconnection of a linear  system and a time-varying multivariable sector nonlinearity.  Using  LMI software, observer gain matrices are computed to satisfy the  circle criterion and, hence, to drive the observer error to zero.  In output-feedback design, the observer is combined with control laws  that ensure input-to-state stability with respect to the observer  error.  Robustness to unmodeled dynamics is achieved with a  small-gain assignment design, as illustrated on a jet engine  compressor example. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: A new robust control to improve the dynamic performance of induction  motors
Abstract: A nonlinear auto-disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) has been  developed to ensure high dynamic performance in this paper.  By using the extended state observer (ESO), ADRC can estimate accurately the  derivative signals and accurate decoupling of induction motor is  achieved too.  In addition, the proposed strategy doesn't require  knowledge of induction motor parameters.  The simulation and  experiment results show that the controller operates quite robustly  under modelling uncertainty and external disturbance, and it is  concluded that the proposed topology produces better dynamic  performance such as small overshoot and fast transient time in the  speed control than classical PID controller.  9 Refs.

Title: Holonic assembly system with Plug and Produce
Abstract: An assembly system based on holonic concept has been newly installed.  The system consists of three manipulators, one belt-conveyor and two warehouses.  The system assembles several parts into a product.  Its  sequences are planned by negotiation among the assembly devices by  means of contract net protocol.  Thus, even though the parts are  supplied at different warehouses, the system can generate a sequence of transportation automatically.  Utilizing the characteristics of  distributed autonomous systems, a new concept Plug and Produce is  proposed.  A device can be installed easily and then immediately  start to work.  This system has high robustness against the  reconfiguration and sudden changes of products.  Experiments were  made for two kinds of assembly tasks and verified the efficiency of  the system. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  7  Refs.

Title: Schema-based conversation modeling for agent-oriented manufacturing  systems
Abstract: In agent-oriented manufacturing systems, an efficient and flexible  computational conversation model can enable more effective and  robust communication, cooperation, and negotiation among agents.   This paper therefore describes a schema-based agent conversation  model for intelligent agent-oriented manufacturing systems.   Conversation schemata are constructed by (1) identifying agent types and their interactions; (2) capturing and formalizing interaction  constraints; (3) verifying schemata using colored petri net (CPN)  (to prevent deadlock and livelock of conversations); (4) translating the schemata into production rule sets and Java thread classes; (5)  identifying inter-schema relationships and building class  hierarchies of schemata; (6) constructing conversation managers  (CMs) to control and coordinate the schema thread-based dynamic  execution.  An application example in distributed production  planning, implemented in the Java environment, shows the  effectiveness of the method. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: Efficiency versus fairness in network-wide ramp metering
Abstract: The Advanced Motorway Optimal Control (AMOC) strategy for optimal  network-wide ramp metering is applied to the ring-road of Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in the aim of investigating some important and  interesting problems arising in ubiquitous ramp metering.  A number  of adequately chosen scenarios along with a thorough analysis,  interpretation, and suitable visualization of the obtained results  provides a basis for the beter understanding of some complex  interrelationships of partially conflicting performance criteria.   More precisely, the strategy's efficiency and fairness properties as well as their trade-off are studied and their partially competitive  behaviour is discussed.  This trade-off is implicitly addressed by  the AMOC strategy through consideration of the available ramp  storage space, something which may be used as a tool to establish a  desired policy of the system's efficiency versus fairness.  8 Refs.

Title: Fault detection, identification and reconstruction for ground  vehicles
Abstract: Fault detection filter and fault reconstruction process are designed  to monitor the sensors and actuators on ground vehicles.  The fault  can be detected because the residual generated by the fault  detection filter is zero when there is no fault and the residual  becomes nonzero when a fault occurs.  Furthermore, the faulty  component can be identified because of the residual is nonzero in a  unique and apriori known direction for each fault.  Finally, the  fault can be reconstructed from the residual by the fault  reconstruction process.  The performance of the fault detection  filter and fault reconstruction process are evaluated using  empirical data.  14 Refs.

Title: Adaptive controller design of MEMS gyroscopes
Abstract: A new angular rate-sensing scheme for z-axis MEMS oscillatory  gyroscopes, which is based on observer-based adaptive control, is  presented.  The proposed observer based adaptive control scheme  estimates the component of the angular velocity vector (z-axis),  which is orthogonal to the plane of oscillation of the gyroscope, as well as compensates friction forces, and fabrication imperfections,  which cause model parameter variations and the presence of  off-diagonal terms in the system's stiffness and damping matrix.  The convergence and resolution analysis presented in this paper shows  that the proposed observer-based adaptive controlled scheme offer  several advantages over conventional open-loop and closed-loop  sensing strategies, including a larger operational bandwidth,  producing no zero-rate output, the ability of self-calibration and a large robustness to parameter variation cause by fabrication defects and ambient conditions.  6 Refs.

Title: Application of the nafion-platinum composite actuator
Abstract: Nafion-platinum composite (IPMC or ICPF) is one of the electro-active polymer actuators nearest to real applications.  This paper  introduces development of some actuation devices using IPMC.  A  distributed actuation device has a number of EFD (Elliptic Friction  Drive) elements that give planar motion with two degrees of freedom  by 2 IPMC actuators.  Coordinated motion of EFDs realizes robustness  of drive.  A soft micromanipulator with three degrees of freedom is a parallel mechanism having 4 actuator parts enabling motion in x, y  and z directions.  A face actuation device is a sheet that changes  its shape arbitrarily by applying electric stimuli to its grid  electrode structure.  In order to develop the mechanical structures  and the control strategies for those applications, appropriate  models are essential.  It introduces a gray-box model practical for  the design purpose.  28 Refs.

Title: Worst-case analysis of finite-time control policies
Abstract: Finite-time control policies are common in batch and semibatch  operations.  A novel approach is proposed that quantifies the impact  of parameter and control implementation inaccuracies on the  performance of such control policies.  This information can be used  to decide whether more experiments are needed to produce parameter  estimates of higher accuracy, or to define performance objectives  for the lower level control loops that implement the control  trajectory.  The approach is evaluated through application to the  multidimensional growth of crystals used in nonlinear optics  applications, where the nominal parameters and uncertainties are  quantified from experimental data.  Robustness estimates are provided with reasonable computational requirements.  58 Refs.

Abstract: We consider in this work the problem of robust identification of  lightly damped flexible structures by means of a family of  orthonormal basis functions, in order to model the dynamics of this  kind of systems in a certain frequency range of interest.  It is  possible in this way to reduce conservativeness of the  identification process.  We propose a method to generate the  orthonormal bases that is based on the cascade of balanced  state-space realizations of all-pass filters, and we develop for  this case a less conservative explicit worst case error bounds.  We  present an application of this method to both simulated and  experimental frequency response data.  25 Refs.

Abstract: A Smith predictor controller (SPC) is designed for an uncertain  pasteurisation process exhibiting variable time delay.  As the SPC  may be very sensitive to model-plant mismatch, especial attention  must be paid to ensure robustness of the design when the model of  the plant is not precisely known.  This paper introduces two criteria for such cases.  The first criterion is based on bandwidth  considerations and the second one introduces some guidelines to  improve the design by using the quantitative feedback theory  technique.  An experimental verification of the proposed methodology  on the pasteurisation plant is also presented. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  25 Refs.

Title: mu Synthesis for a large flexible space structure experimental  testbed
Abstract: An application is presented of mu synthesis to the robust control of  a large flexible space structure experimental testbed called Daisy.   A perturbed left-coprime factorization of Daisy's dynamics is used  to capture the uncertainty in the modes.  Designs of the mu synthesis controller based on left-coprime factorizations of 46th-order  collocated and noncollocated models of Daisy are presented together  with simulation and experimental results.  These results are compared to those obtained with H// infinity controllers, and it is shown  that the mu controllers performed better.  These controllers provide  robust performance with respect to given bounds on modal parameter  uncertainties without resorting to computationally complex  techniques involving real structured perturbations.  17 Refs.

Title: Linear QFT control of a highly nonlinear multi-machine power system
Abstract: A quantitative feedback theory (QFT) method of Horowitz, treating  nonlinearities as equivalent disturbances, is applied to the linear  control of a multi-machine power system.  This system has a smooth  nonlinear dynamics so the original approach was simplified.  From the design point of view good results were obtained with simple  controllers (automatic voltage regulator, speed governor, power  system stabilizer) when the power system was affected by large load  variations and short circuits.  To reduce significantly the steady  state errors which appeared, a novel rotor speed error amplification scheme was employed.  This increased the autonomy of the controlled  power system to combat big distortions from normal operating  conditions.  20 Refs.

Title: Observability and stabilization of the vibrating string equipped with bouncing point sensors and actuators
Abstract: The issues of observability and stabilization are analysed for a  vibrating string equipped, respectively, either with a point sensor  measuring its displacement or a vertical tie-down viscous damper.  It is well known that the aforementioned properties hold for the  stationary devices of these types only when they are placed at the  'irrational points' of the string.  The latter creates obvious  difficulties in applications.  In this article we discuss how mobile  point sensors and dampers, bouncing in a rather simple fashion  between any two points on the string, can be employed instead in a  more 'feasible and robust' way.  22 Refs.

The problem of calibration direction  configuration was probed and some optimizing method was presented to minimize the estimation errors.

Abstract: A new vector control system of an induction motor is proposed in this paper to reduce the influence of iron loss, which has been difficult to deal with.

But, it is  necessary for experts to tune parameters initially in those methods.  The new method can reduce the influence of iron loss by using a  robust flux observer.  By adding current decoupling control for  compensation of the iron loss, a vector control system with high  torque linearity can be constructed. copy 2001 Scripta Technica,  Electr Eng Jpn.  8 Refs.

Title: Nonlinear robust control design for power system including  superconducting magnetic energy storage devices
Abstract: Recently the development of power electronics and superconducting  technology made it possible that superconducting magnetic energy  storage (SMES) took part in the power system as FACTS devices to  enhance transient stability.  In this paper, a second order robust  model of SMES is established first according to the experimental  results of SMES prototype.  Then the nonlinear robust model of the  single-machine infinite-bus power system including SMES is obtained.  Furthermore, the paper presents a procedure to obtain the nonlinear  robust control law of SMES based on feedback linearization theory.   The simulation results illustrate that the nonlinear robust  controller can restore the system after large disturbance rapidly  and improve the transient stability limits of the system, thus  increasing the capacity of transmitting power.  14 Refs.

Title: Identification of experimental models for control design
Abstract: The identification of linear models that are particularly suitable  for serving as a basis for (robust) model-based control design has  recently attracted considerable attention.  Both the system  identification community and the control community have spent  considerable efforts in developing a coherent approach to the  problem.  Typical problems that have to be dealt with consider  questions of optimal experiment design, feedback-relevant system  approximations and control-relevant model uncertainty  specifications.  Research into these problems has delivered several  attempts for bridging the gap between identification and control  theory.  In this lecture these developments will be highlighted,  directing particular attention to the identification of  control-relevant approximate models, the use of closed-loop  experimental data for identification, the quantification of model  uncertainty, and the use of identification criteria that are  motivated by control performance cost functions.  25 Refs.

A method of  eliminating the chattering encountered load-frequency controller  combining the sliding mode control technique is presented.  Overall  system stability, for all admissible system parameter uncertainties  and the generation-rate constraint, is ensured when the robust  load-frequency controller and sliding mode controller are in  operation.  The effectiveness of the proposed robust control scheme  has been verified through simulation studies on a three-area  interconnected power system model.  18 Refs.

Title: Sensorless control of induction motors - Performance and limitations
Abstract: Controlled induction motor drives without mechanical sensors for  speed or motor shaft position have the attraction of low cost and  high reliability.  The identification of rotor speed is generally  based on measured terminal voltages and currents.  Dynamic models are used to estimate the magnitude and spatial orientation of the  fundamental magnetic flux waves in the stator or in the rotor.  Open  loop estimators and closed loop observers differ with respect to  accuracy, robustness, and sensitivity against model parameter  variations.  Dynamic performance and steady-state speed accuracy in  the low speed range is achieved by exploiting parasitic effects of  the machine.  The overview in this paper uses signal flow graphs of  complex space vector quantities to provide an insightful description of the systems used in sensorless control of induction motors.  11  Refs.

Abstract: In this paper, a robust variable structure control (VSC) strategy is  presented for stabilizing the uncertain systems with multiple time  delays where the uncertainty in the state model does not satisfy the matching condition.  Based on the Bellman-Gronwall theorem, we  provide a sufficient condition for the existence of switching  hyperplane and we give an explicit formula of switching hyperplane  guaranteeing the asymptotic stability of the reduced-order  equivalent system dynamics restricted to the switching hyperplane.   Furthermore, by means of the Lyapunov stability theory and norm  technique, we derive an approximating continuous VSC law for  uncertain systems with multiple time delays and mismatched  uncertainties which are difficult to deal with by using conventional design approaches.  Finally, an example is given to illustrate the  design procedure and results of proposed approach.  22 Refs.

Title: Myopotential denoising of ECG signals using wavelet thresholding  methods
Abstract: We present empirical comparisons of several wavelet-denoising methods applied to the problem of removing (denoising) myopotential noise  from the observed noisy ECG signal.  Namely, we compare the denoising accuracy and robustness of several wavelet thresholding methods  (VISU, SURE and soft thresholding) and a new thresholding approach  based on Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) learning theory.  Our findings  indicate that the VC-based wavelet approach is superior to the  standard thresholding methods in that it achieves: Higher denoising  accuracy (in terms of both MSE measure and visual quality) and more  robust and compact representation of the denoised signal (i.e., it  uses fewer wavelets). copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title: Robust fuzzy control of a vibrating thin plate
Abstract: This paper investigates the robust adaptive fuzzy control of low  frequency modes of a rectangular thin plate with pointwise actuators and sensors.  The control system applies a finite number of actuators and sensors to damp actively the undesirable transient vibrations of the plate.  In the proposed control scheme, a robust observer-based  controller is first adopted to maintain loop stability while in the  presence of the high-frequency unmodeled residuals.  The second part  of the controller is an adaptive fuzzy inference system, which is  introduced to improve regulation performance.  To maintain overall  stability robustness, confinement imposed on the adaptive fuzzy  command is performed to ensure that it will not overshoot the  permissible upper bound.  Simulation results for an all-clamped plate show that the proposed design provides efficient vibration  suppression while maintaining robust stability.  23 Refs.

Title: Analise de desempenho de observadores de estado robustos na  localizacao de falhas   Performance analysis of robust state observers in fault location
Abstract: The state observers can reconstruct and monitor unmeasurable states.   A new concept of fault detection and isolation using state observers is presented.  The method selects the parameters from components that may fail during the process and constructs optimized robust  observers.  To isolate component failures via robust observation, a  bank of detection observers is organized, in which each observer is  only sensitive to one specified component failure while robust to  all other component failures.  This paper analyzes the performance of transient and steady-state behavior of the state observer.  (Author  abstract) 12 Refs.

Title: Identificacao de parametros de elementos de suporte em elastodinamica utilizando algoritmos geneticos   Identification of support parameters in elastodynamics using genetic  algorithms
Abstract: The objective of this work is to perform an assessment of the  identification of mount parameters of vibratory systems using  genetic algorithms.  Two methodologies are used: in the first one,  linear and non-linear support parameters are identified from the  time-domain responses.  In the second one, the parameters are  identified considering a sub-structure coupling technique using  frequency response functions.  Applications to numerically simulated  structures are performed.  Based on numerical simulation examples,  the identification method is appraised in terms of the accuracy of  the obtained solutions and robustness to random noise present in the used data.

Title: Modified sliding-mode bang-bang control for seismically excited civil structures
Abstract: Based on the sliding-mode control and bang-bang control methods, a  sliding-mode bang-bang control (SMBBC) method is presented in this  paper.  Since servohydraulic actuators are popular control-force  delivery devices in actual structural control implementation, which  are not suitable for high-speed switching of control-forces in  bang-bang control, the modified sliding- mode bang-bang control  (MSMBBC) law based on a smooth exponential function instead of sign  function is investigated.  Likewise, static output SMBBC that  utilizes only the measured information from a limited number of  sensors without an observer is also presented.  Determination of  maximum control-forces of actuators is investigated.  The performance and robustness of the proposed control methods are studied in  numerical simulation.  The results demonstrate that the MSMBBC method is a viable and attractive control strategy for application to  seismically excited linear structures.  (Author abstract) 8 Refs.

Title: Adaptive fuzzy neural network control for motor-toggle servomechanism
Abstract: In this study, the dynamic responses of an adaptive fuzzy neural  network (FNN) controlled toggle mechanism is described.  The toggle  mechanism is driven by a permanent magnet (PM) synchronous servo  motor.  First, based on the principle of computed torque, an adaptive controller is developed to control the position of a slider of the  motor-toggle servomechanism.  Since the selection of control gain of  the adaptive controller has a significant effect on the system  performance, an adaptive FNN controller is proposed to control the  motor-toggle servomechanism.  In the proposed adaptive FNN  controller, an FNN is adopted to facilitate the adjustment of  control gain on line.  Moreover, simulated and experimental results  due to a periodic sinusoidal command show that the dynamic behaviors of the proposed adaptive and adaptive FNN controllers are robust  with regard to uncertainties.

Title: Variable structure methods in hydraulic servo systems control
Abstract: In the general framework of hydraulic servo systems, this paper  addresses the problem of position control in the presence of  important friction nonlinearities.  The accent falls on the variable  structure methodology, as we try to use its intrinsic robustness  properties.  Several friction observers, including the one based on a variable structure approach, were incorporated and tested in an  acceleration feedback control.  Next, we present a novel  implementation of a variable structure controller, which lumps  friction and load as an external disturbance.  Results of extensive  experimental testing encourage the use of variable structure methods in a class of highly nonlinear hydraulic servo systems.  (Author  abstract) 10 Refs.

Title: Note on absolute stability of uncertain systems
Abstract: The absolute stability of nonlinear systems is an important  robustness issue which has been studied intensively since its first  formulation by Lur'e.  Recently, extensions of the solutions to  different versions of this problem have been developed for cases  with either structured or unstructured uncertainties in the linear  part.  In this note, the circle criterion and the Popov criterion are recast in an even more general setting; one which accommodates both  types of perturbations in the linear plant.  Numerical examples are  provided to illustrate the application of these frequency domain  tools.  (Author abstract) 14 Refs.

Title: Combined PID/adaptive controller for a class of nonlinear systems
Abstract: This paper presents a robust control method for a class of nonlinear  systems, based on a mixed PID/adaptive algorithm.  The nonlinear  system is considered as a second-order linear dominant model with an unmodeled dynamics that is possibly nonlinear and time-varying.  The  PID part of the controller is applied to stabilize the dominant  model.  The adaptive part of the controller is used to compensate for the deviation of the system characteristics from the dominant linear model for performance enhancement.  The advantage of our controller  is that it can cope with strong nonlinearities in the system without abandoning the PID controller which is well-known to many engineers.  The proposed control scheme guarantees the boundedness of the system states and parameter estimation.  An example is given to illustrate  the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

Title: On the strengthened robust SPR problem for discrete-time systems
Abstract: The well-known necessary and sufficient condition to find a solution  to the robust strictly positive real (SPR) problem, namely, that the phase difference of the polynomials involved must be less than pi,  was found to be also necessary and sufficient in the strengthened  robust SPR problem by Anderson and Landau in a recent work, only for the continuous-time case.  In this brief communication, we derive a  necessary condition in the discrete-time case, which cannot be  formulated in phase terms, and which is more stringent than the  condition of the robust SPR problem, thereby establishing a  fundamental difference between both continuous-time and  discrete-time domains.

Title: Estimation of dispersion effects from robust design experiments with  censored response data
Abstract: A method is presented for estimating dispersion effects (DE) from  robust design experiments (RDE) with control and noise factors  involving censored response data.  This method is developed to  discern the significance of DE from RDE and the method aims at  analyzing a multi-level/multi-factor experiment.  This method imputes censored data by a regression based imputation technique, assuming  that the distribution of lifetime before and after censoring is  identical.  This method also models the residuals to identify  important DE, assuming that the distribution of the observed random  variables of the model is the same with or without censored response data.  Finally, the method is demonstrated through a numerical  example.  (Author abstract) 25 Refs.

Title: Multi-thread evolutionary programming and its application to  truck-and-trailer backer-upper control
Abstract: This paper presents a multi-thread evolutionary programming (MEP)  technique that is composed of global, local, and minimal search  units.  An appropriate search routine is called depending on the  current situation and the individuals are updated by using the  selected routine.  In each search routine, the individuals are  updated with a normalized relative fitness function to improve the  robustness of the algorithm.  The proposed method is applied to the  problem of backing up a truck-and-trailer system to a loading dock.   A fuzzy logic controller is designed for a truck-and-trailer  backer-upper system and the MEP algorithm is used to optimize the  representative parameters of the fuzzy logic controller.  The  simulation results show that the proposed controller performs well  even under a large variety of initial positions.  (Author abstract)  10 Refs.

Title: New adaptation-mode control based on cross correlation for a robust  adaptive microphone array
Abstract: This paper proposes a new adaptation-mode control (AMC) for a robust  adaptive microphone array with an adaptive blocking matrix  (RAMA-ABM).  The proposed AMC is based on cross correlations of two  microphone signals and uses a state machine for controlling the  adaptation to avoid target-signal cancellation.  Evaluation with  sound data obtained in different acoustic environments demonstrates  that the noise reduction by the proposed AMC is 3 dB better than  that by the AMC based on the SNR estimate.  Subjective listening  tests show that the quality of the output signal by the proposed AMC is comparable to or even better than those by the conventional AMCs.  (Author abstract) 22 Refs.

Title: Nonlinear robust control of STATCOM
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the robust nonlinear control of the  static compensator (STATCOM).  The Direct Feedback Linearization  (DFL) technique is employed to transform the nonlinear model of the  STATCOM system into a linear form.  A robust controller design  approach is used to deal with the parametric uncertainties.  The  proposed controller has a simple structure, performing with great  robustness and effectiveness.  It can ensure that the controlled  system is asymptotically stable within a wide range of system  parameters, as long as the boundaries of the parameters are given.   The simulation results obtained from a three-bus power system show  that the controller can achieve good voltage regulation in the  presence of parameter uncertainties.  (Author abstract) 11 Refs.

Title: Computational complexity of real structured singular value in l//p  setting
Abstract: This paper studies a generalized real structured singular value (mu)  problem where uncertain parameters are bounded by an l//p norm.  Two  results are presented.  The first one shows that this generalized mu  problem is NP-hard for any given rational number p qq [ 1, infinity] .  The NP-hardness holds as long as k, the  size of the largest repeated block, exceeds one.  This result  generalizes the known NP-hardness result for the conventional mu  problem (with p = infinity ). Our second result, which strengthens  the first one, considers the approximability problem of the  generalized mu.  We show that the problem of obtaining an estimate  for the generalized mu with some guaranteed bound on the relative  error remains to be NP-hard, regardless how large this bound is.

An example three-machine power system is  presented in the paper to demonstrate the application of the  effectiveness function proposed, where the installing location and  feedback signal of a TCSC-based stabilizer is selected that not only is effective and robust, but also imposes a non-negative interaction on a PSS installed in the power system.

Abstract: The main contribution of this paper is a theorem to guarantee uniform global asymptotic stability (UGAS) and uniform local exponential  stability (ULES) for a class of nonlinear non-autonomous systems  which includes passive systems.  These properties (and a uniform  local Lipschitz condition) guarantee robustness of stability while  weaker properties, like uniform global stability plus global  convergence, do not.  Our main result is then used in the tracking  control problem of mechanical systems and ships.  We use an adaptive  backstepping design and prove UGAS of the closed-loop tracking error system, in particular, we obtain that both the tracking and  parameter estimation errors converge uniformly globally to zero.

Title: Three-dimensional nonlinear H// infinity guidance law
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel three-dimensional missile guidance law  design based on nonlinear H// infinity control.  The complete  nonlinear kinematics of pursuit-evasion motion is considered in the  three-dimensional spherical co-ordinates system; neither  linearization nor small angle assumption is made here.  The nonlinear H// infinity guidance law is expressed in a simple form by solving  the associated Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential inequality  analytically.  Unlike adaptive guidance laws, the implement of the  proposed robust H// infinity guidance law does not require the  information of target acceleration, while ensuring acceptable  interceptive performance for arbitrary target with finite  acceleration.  The resulting pursuit-evasion trajectories for both  the H// infinity -guided missile and the worst-case target are  determined in closed form, and the performance robustness against  variations in target acceleration, in engagement condition, and in  control loop gain, is verified by numerical simulations.

Title: Integral quadratic constraints-based robust controller  two-mass-spring system
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the robust controller design for  two-mass-spring system based on integral quadratic constraints  (IQC's) and give a design example of multipurpose controllers  (state-feedback controller case).  The controller design need to  achieve four major constraints: (i) tracking with zero steady-state  error, (ii) guaranteed level of H// infinity performance index  gamma(L//2 gain) from the exogenous input w to the output z which  indicate input-to-output properties of the system, (iii) accordance  to IQC's, and (iv) pole placement in a specified region,  simultaneously in the presence of physical parameter uncertainties.   The simulation results show that our robust controller design for  this two-mass-spring system endures the uncertain environment and  the setting time is small about 0.1.  In particular, we are always  able to control required poles in the vertical strip region and to  track along any required angle.  (Author abstract) 4 Refs.

Abstract: A new and simple repetitive controller design procedure in controller parameter space is presented here.  The structure of the filters in  the repetitive controller are fixed from the start and parameters  within these filters are tuned using the design method.  This  approach results in simple and physically meaningful controllers  that are easily implementable.  The design method is based on mapping frequency domain performance specifications to controller parameter  plane.  Sensitivity function magnitude bounds and a relative  stability measure are chosen as the frequency domain specifications  to be mapped into controller parameter space here.  The design method is illustrated numerically in the context of a servohydraulic  material testing machine application available in the literature.  27 Refs.

Abstract: This paper presents a new sliding mode controller for semi-active  suspension systems with Magnetorheological (MR) dampers which have  undesirable nonlinear properties.  In the proposed controller, a  desired semi-active suspension system is chosen as the reference  model to be followed, and the control low is determined so that an  asymptotically stable sliding mode will occur in the error dynamics  between the plant and the reference model states.  The advantages of  the proposed controller are: (1) measurement of the damper force is  not required, (2) the reference model specifies the desired  performance considering the passivity constraint of the damper, (3)  it is highly possible to maintain the sliding mode and achieve high  robustness against model uncertainties and disturbances.

Abstract: A robust neuro-fuzzy controller with tuning mechanism of membership  functions and neural weights to achieve the tracking control of  composite multivariable systems is proposed.

By an  on-line tuning mechanism, the fuzzy system can effectively deal with the equivalent uncertainties that may appear in the subsystems due  to plant uncertainty, function approximation error, or external  disturbance.  By using Lyapunov stability theory, the overall system  with the proposed controller has been proved to be uniform ultimate  bounded.

Title: Comparing multicast protocols in mobile ad hoc networks
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for comparing the performance of  multicast protocols in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) with respect  to delay, efficiency, and robustness.  For each metric, we develop  the notion of optimality that allows us to compare performance  against a common set of reference points.  Knowing where a protocol's performance diverges from optimal also indicates where efforts at  improvement will provide the most benefit.  Next we present a  cross-platform physical layer model that allows researchers working  with different simulation packages use a common physical model of  the network.  We then use simulations to illustrate the performance  of a candidate protocol relative to optimal.  An interesting result  of the simulations is that MANET nodes with very high degrees of  connectivity do not necessarily improve the performance of multicast routing protocols.  13 Refs.

Title: Uniting local and global controllers with robustness to vanishing  noise
Abstract: We consider control systems for which we know two stabilizing  controllers.  One is globally asymptotically stabilizing, the other  one is only locally asymptotically stabilizing but for some reason  we insist on using it in a neighborhood of the origin.  We look for a uniting control law being equal to the local feedback on a  neighborhood of the origin, equal to the global one outside of a  larger neighborhood and being a globally stabilizing controller.  We  study several solutions based on continuous, discontinuous, hybrid,  time-varying controllers.  One criterion of the selection of a  controller is the robustness of the stability to vanishing noise.   This leads us in particular to consider a kind of generalization of  Krasovskii trajectories for hybrid systems.  18 Refs.

Abstract: We provide an observer-based fault detection and isolation scheme for periodic systems.  The observer is designed using the lift for the  periodic system.  To provide robustness with respect to disturbance  inputs, we develop a novel parity approach for periodic systems.   Disturbance rejection is achieved by designing a finite impulse  response (FIR) annihilator for the transfer function of the system  lift with the disturbance as input.  The resulting annihilator is  then used to obtain constant weighting matrices for the residuals of the periodic system at different sampling points.  Two illustrative  examples, including computer simulation of the periodic systems, are provided.  8 Refs.

Title: Cooperative multi-input shaping for arbitrary inputs
Abstract: Input shaping is an effective tool to reduce residual vibration when  maneuvering flexible structures.  For multiple inputs, a common  scheme is to design a shaper with zeros at every vibrational mode (a "single-input shaper") and use it for all inputs.  Recently, other  techniques have been developed in which the inputs "cooperate" to  cancel the modes, resulting in shorter shapers and therefore less  delay.  Most of these methods require all inputs to be the same or  similar, and in some cases require knowledge of what the inputs are  beforehand.  This paper first presents a cooperative shaping  technique for the case where inputs are arbitrary but known, and a  procedure for improving robustness is also discussed.  A method is  then presented for cooperative shaping when the inputs are unknown.   Both schemes realize a performance increase over single-input  shaping approaches.  7 Refs.

Title: Solution of a differential game formulation of military air  operations by the method of characteristics
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a zero-sum differential game formulation  for the control of military air operations.  The model consists of a  system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the dynamics of the operations and a suitably chosen quadratic payoff function.   Control variables are engagement intensities and velocities, and  there are constraints on the controls.  The method of characteristics (based on the Pontryagin maximum principle) is used to solve the  associated Hamilton-Jacobi equation.  The Hamiltonian in this  nonlinear formulation can be explicitly optimized with respect to  the controls.  Numerical simulations study the enforcement of  constraints a) by means of penalties in the payoff function or b)  explicitly.  The numerical results show robustness with respect to  various parameters.  2 Refs.

Title: Desired compensation adaptive robust control of single-rod  electro-hydraulic actuator
Abstract: This paper presents a desired compensation adaptive robust control  (DCARC) of single-rod electro-hydraulic actuator.  Compared with the  existing adaptive robust control (ARC) algorithms, the DCARC  algorithm presented here has the unique feature that the adaptive  model compensation part depends on the reference trajectory and  parameter estimations only.  This unique feature has several  advantages.  Firstly, the interaction between the parameter  adaptation and the robust control law is minimized, which may  facilitate the controller gain tuning process considerably.   Secondly, the effect of measurement noise is minimized since the  regressor does not depend on actual state measurements directly.   Therefore, a fast adaptation rate could be chosen in implementation  to speed up the transient response and to improve overall tracking  performance.  Experimental results are shown to verify the  effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.  21 Refs.

Title: Robust nonlinear adaptive control using neural networks
Abstract: This paper provides a robust indirect adaptive control method for  non-affine plants.  Subject to some mild assumptions, the method can  be applied to both minimum and non-minimum phase plants with  operating regions of any finite size while avoiding a set of  restrictions, at least one of which is, imposed by all existing  methods.  This benefits are achieved under the following assumptions: 1) the operating region is limited to the basin of attraction of an  asymptotically stable equilibrium point of the plant, 2) the desired output of the plant is sufficiently slowly varying, and 3) the  output of the plant must be sufficiently sensitive to the input  signal.  It is shown that the adaptive control system will be stable  in the presence of unknown bounded modeling errors.  18 Refs.

Abstract: This paper presents a self-tuning scheme based on response surface  method (RSM) to find the optimal finite impulse response (FIR) Youla parameter for an observer based state feedback track-following  controller that minimizes the 3 times standard deviation of the PES  in an HDD servo system.  All the tested Youla parameters to construct the response surface were selected within a robust stable region  which was defined by an artificial neural network (ANN) trained  off-line.  Such that the H// infinity bound of some sampled-data  system channels could be kept during the response data collection.   The experimental data showed that such a self-tuning scheme could  improve the position accuracy considerably in a short tuning time  without any prior knowledge of the disturbance and noise, while  robustly stabilizing the system.  18 Refs.

Title: Robust and almost perfect periodic tracking of nonlinear systems  using repetitive VSC
Abstract: In this paper, a Repetitive Variable Structure Control (RVSC)  approach is originated for the nonlinear system with state-dependent modeling uncertainties and exogenous periodic disturbance.  RVSC  incorporates repetitive control into VSC.  The VSC part ensures the  robustness to the uncertain system, and the modeling uncertainties  are relaxed to be locally Lipschitz instead of being globally  Lipschitz.  Saturation design ensures the uniform boundedness of the  repetitive control signal.  Repetitive control law using directly the VSC signal of the previous cycle for updating is further proposed if a constant bounding function is available.  Rigorous proof based on  energy function and functional analysis shows that the filtered  tracking error converges to zero on the L//2 norm, and almost  perfect periodic tracking is achieved.  Simulation results confirm  the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  18 Refs.

Title: Mixed bounded inputs (impulsive and bang-bang) for stable control  systems
Abstract: It is shown that persistently acting mixed bounded inputs (impulsive  and bang-bang) can be realized in a feedback synthesis.  The inputs  are assumed to be cooperating to be time maximum disturbances to  counter system stability, for example; but one could be a control  input and the other a disturbance.  The realization is based on a  recharging rate limit for the impulsive input and a bound constraint on the bang-bang input.  Complete details are provided on  constructing the feedback synthesis using switch curve ideas for  second order stable systems.  Simulation results show how the  expanded switch curves can be used to drive the system state to a  maximum limit cycle oscillation.  7 Refs.

Abstract: In this paper, the problem of robust H// infinity filter with FIR  (Finite Impulse Response) structure for linear continuous  time-varying systems with sampled-data measurements is to be  considered.  It is assumed that the system is subject to real  time-varying uncertainty which is represented by the state-space  model having parameter uncertainty.  The sampled-data system is  represented by using picewise continuous system with finite jumps.   The robust H// infinity FIR filter is derived by using the  equivalence relationship between the FIR filter and the recursive  filter, that would be guarantee a prescribed H// infinity  performance in the continuous-time context, irrespective of the  parameter uncertainty and unknown initial states.  10 Refs.

Abstract: In this paper, the recently proposed neural network adaptive robust  control (NNARC) design are generalized to synthesize performance  oriented control laws for a class of nonlinear systems transformable to the semi-strict feedback forms through the incorporation of  backstepping design techniques.  All unknown but repeatable  nonlinearities in system are approximated by outputs of multi-layer  neural networks to achieve a better model compensation and an  improved performance.  Through the use of discontinuous projections  with fictitious bounds, a controlled on-line training of all NN  weights is achieved.  Robust control terms can then be constructed to attenuate various model uncertainties effectively for a guaranteed  output tracking transient performance and a guaranteed final  tracking accuracy.  13 Refs.

Title: Multi-model robust control for nonlinear chemical processes: A  passivity based approach
Abstract: In this paper, the robust control problem for nonlinear multi-unit  chemical processes is addressed.  The processes discussed admit a set of plant decompositions in an operating region which corresponds to  the variation of the operating point caused by disturbances.  A  passivity based approach is proposed to design decentralized  controllers for these processes.  Namely, the proposed method  determines the best local plant decompositions based on evaluation  of a passivity index, and assesses the closed-loop stability and  performance using the best local plant decompositions.  Local  decentralized controllers can be designed based on the local plant  decomposition to achieve desired closed-loop stability and  performance.  11 Refs.

Title: Robust controller synthesis for plants satisfying a certain class of  IQC
Abstract: This paper considers robust stabilization problem for plants with  uncertainties/nonlinearities satisfying a certain class of IQC's.   The restricted class of IQC can still characterize many kinds of  uncertainties/nonlinearities.  We show this problem reduces to  feasibility of nonconvex matrix inequalities.  Owing to their special structure, they can be solved with reasonable computational effort  as is not the case of BMIs, by combining a nonconvex optimization  technique with interior-point methodology to solve LMIs.  Finally an  illustrative numerical example is given, where the proposed approach is applied to achieve specified gain and phase margins.  11 Refs.

Title: Delay-dependent robust and reliable H** infinity control for linear  uncertain systems with delayed-state and actuator failures
Abstract: This paper focuses on the synthesis problem of robust and reliable  H** infinity control for linear systems with norm-bounded  time-varying parameter uncertainty in the state and delayed-state  matrices and also with actuator failures among a prespecified subset of actuators.  Actuator failures are considered as disturbance  signals of arbitrary values to the system.  LMI (Linear Matrix  Inequality) method is given for the memoryless state feedback  synthesis problem to quadratically stabilize the given systems with  an H** infinity -norm bound constraints on attenuation of augmented  disturbances, including failure signals in cases of actuator  failures for any admissible uncertainty.  The results depend on the  size of the time-delay via the use of Razumikhin-type therorem.  2  Refs.

Title: Robust zero miss distance guidance for missiles with parametric  uncertainties
Abstract: This paper presents a robust guidance law, which renders zero miss  distance (ZMD) against deterministically or randomly maneuvering  targets for all missile parametric uncertainties.  The structured  uncertainties in missile dynamics are modeled by interval transfer  functions.  It is shown that for the nominal case, when the total  missile transfer function is positive real, ZMD can be obtained.   When uncertainties are considered, the problem converges to the  design of a guidance controller which renders a family of transfer  functions positive real.  A new algorithm for the design of such a  controller is proposed.  An example illustrating a typical design  procedure is given, showing the simplicity and effectiveness of the  proposed guidance.  19 Refs.

Title: Robust state dependent riccati equation based guidance laws
Abstract: A robust state dependent Riccati equation based guidance/control is  investigated in this study.  In order to have a better design tool in terms of required interceptor accelerations, the target intercept  geometry is formulated in a set of polar coordinates.  With this  formulation, we formulate a cost function with state dependent  weights.  In this study, we investigate the effects of such cost  functions on the levels of interceptor accelerations.  We also  synthesize a neural network based extra controller to achieve the  robustness in the presence of the target acceleration.  In this  manner, we will not need target acceleration estimation explicitly  in the guidance law.  7 Refs.

Title: An LMI approach to model (In) validation of LPV systems
Abstract: During the past few years efficient tools have been developed to  robustly stabilize Linear Parameter Varying systems.  However, a key  issue that needs to be addressed in order to apply these techniques  to practical problems is the development of techniques that,  starting from experimental data, generate and validate suitable  models.  In this paper we propose a new model validation framework  for LPV systems subject to unstructured uncertainty.  The main result shows that the problem of establishing consistency between the  experimental data and the a priori assumptions on the nominal model, the uncertainty description and the error bounds can be recast as an LMI feasibility problem and be efficiently solved.  Moreover, the  overall computational complexity is similar to that of validating  LTI models of comparable size.  24 Refs.

Title: Model validation of multirate systems from time-domain experimental  data
Abstract: The model validation problem using time-domain experimental data is  studied for multirate linear fractional uncertain models in this  paper.  As a technical tool, the Caratheodory-Fejer interpolation  problem with a nest operator constraint is first investigated.  This  problem is itself of interest mathematically and has potential  applications in addressing other problems in control, signal  processing, and circuit theory.  A necessary and sufficient  solvability condition for this interpolation problem is given.  The  validation tests are then given based on this condition and the  lifting technique.  Tractable convex optimization methods can be used to solve the validation problems.  21 Refs.

Title: Variable structure control of unknown parameters dc servo systems  using CMAC-based learning approach
Abstract: A CMAC-based controller with a compensating neural network and an  update rule is proposed to design the variable structure control  (VSC) of unknown parameters dc servo systems.  By introducing a  stabilizer controller and a CMAC neural network to construct the VSC control law, the new control scheme performs the equivalent control  by a real-time learning algorithm.  The stabilizer controller is  designed by using Lyapunov stability theory and the updating rule of the CMAC weights is obtained by using the gradient descent method.   Simulation results of a simplified robot link model demonstrate the  effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller.  18 Refs.

Title: Quantitative feedback theory (QFT) for chattering reduction and  improved tracking in sliding mode control
Abstract: Sliding mode control (SMC) is a robust control technique with  chattering as a major drawback.  Chattering is undesirable because it can excite unmodeled high frequency dynamics of the system.  One way  to reduce chattering is to introduce a boundary layer around the  sliding surface and keep the boundary layer attractive.  However, the introduction of the boundary layer does not make the sliding surface to converge to zero but rather to oscillate around zero or on the  boundary layer.  In this paper, we design a QFT controller to reduce  the oscillations within the boundary and make the sliding surface  converge to zero.  An example is provided to illustrate the proposed  method.  9 Refs.

Abstract: In a previous paper, a control law has been developed for passive  bilateral teleoperator to achieve theoretically perfect coordination in the presence of arbitrary environment forcing, and to enable the  teleoperator to behave like a passive rigid mechanical tool.  In this paper, we develop an adaptive control law to relax the need for the  precise knowledge of inertia parameters, and a robust control law to eliminate the need for expensive force sensors.  In addition, a novel experiment, that mimics the dynamics of piano playing is used to  evaluate the efficacies of the various controllers to provide  kinesthetic coupling.  5 Refs.

Title: A robust nonlinear controller design for a pneumatic actuator
Abstract: This paper presents a feedback linearization based variable structure controller for a pneumatically actuated system utilizing sliding  mode observers.  Using the robustness implications of the sliding  mode control theory and the structural properties of pneumatically  actuated systems, a nonlinear controller is designed to drive the  output tracking error to zero in finite time.  Strong robustness with respect to bounded modeling and parameter uncertainties is attained  through compensation of the friction effect of the piston in the  cylinder body.  The controller and the observer are based on a  third-order nonlinear state-space model of a pneumatic system which  was developed, validated numerically with experimental data and  presented in another paper, [6] .   Simulation results are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of  the designed observer and the good performance of the designed  tracking controller.  11 Refs.

Title: A sliding observer for differential-algebraic (DAE) systems
Abstract: A non-linear observer for systems modeled as linear  differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) is presented: The DAE system model is first realized by converting it into an equivalent control  problem via the singularly perturbed sliding manifold (SPSM)  approach.  This process introduces errors, which are treated as  disturbances to the "equivalent" state-space formulation obtained.  A robust sliding observer is then designed, ensuring asymptotic  stability in the presence of said disturbances.  This observer  architecture results in a coupled dual feedback loop structure;  conditions for decoupling the two loops are given and a design  procedure is outlined.  An illustrative numerical example follows.   The paper concludes with a brief description of future research  issues in refining this approach.  8 Refs.

Title: Specification of security constraint in UML
Abstract: Over recent years various initiatives for solving the problem of  security in databases have arisen.  However all of them have been  only partial solutions which resolved isolated problems.   Consequently a global solution to the problem has not been reached  yet.  We think a methodological approach in which security is taken  into consideration from the earliest stages of the development  process of the databases is the best strategy.  In this paper we  present a language for specifying security constraints in models of  classes, which is one step of a complete methodology for the  development of secure multilevel databases.  This language is called  OSCL (Object Security Constraint Language).  OSCL is based on the  constraint language OCL (Object Constraint Language), which is used  by the current standard of modelling, UML (Unified Modelling  Language).  15 Refs.

The  bought software, after downloading from website of the merchant,  will be protected in such a way that it can only be installed one  time in the buyer's computer.  Further, a buyer who redistributed  copies of the bought software, called a traitor, can be traced from  an illegal copy of software program.

Title: Uniform Web presence architecture for people, places, and things
Abstract: The Cooltown vision is that people, places, and things have a Web  representation and that many useful services can be offered by  creating a tighter link between the real world entity and its  virtual representation.  We defined a horizontal and uniform software architecture for building a Web presence for people, places, and  things.  This architecture enables the dynamic generation of Web  contents based on the user context (location, identity, device  capabilities), security permissions, and the relationships with  other Web presences.  Our implementation of this architecture is  portable enough to be embedded in the entity that the Web presence  describe but also scalable enough to support multiple Web presence  hosting.  We focused on making the creation of a Web presence easy  for non-programmers.  9 Refs.

Title: Set of line gratings as a diffraction structure protecting optical  signs against copying: New proposal including colorimetric aspects
Abstract: Well known properties of diffraction gratings are connected with  their response to wavelength and polarization state of light  incident on a grating.  Although diffraction gratings are used as one of structures in modern optical security signs, their interesting  properties seem to be rather rarely taken into consideration for  distinguishing between originals and "illegal" copies of optical  marks.  In this paper a relative simple diffraction structure and  corresponding alternative method of inspection are proposed.  This  method can be particularly useful for machine reading, although its  usability for visual inspection can be also considered.  4 Refs.

Title: Combined watermarking for image authentication and protection
Abstract: A novel combined watermarking scheme for image authentication and  protection is proposed in this paper.  By utilizing the publicly  available wavelet-based just noticeable distortion (JND) values, the hidden watermark is designed to carry the host image's information  such that blind watermark detection becomes possible.  The watermarks are embedded using the previously proposed cocktail watermarking  technique and are extracted by a quantization process.  According to  the polarities and the differences of the hidden and the extracted  watermarks, the fragility and robustness of a watermark can be  measured, respectively, such that both content authentication and  copyright protection are achieved simultaneously.  14 Refs.

Abstract: Regarding security particularly in the field of multimedia, the  requirements on security increase.  If and in which way security  mechanisms can be applied to multimedia data and their applications  needs to be analyzed for each purpose separately.  This is mainly due to the structure and complexity of multimedia.  Based on the main  issues of IT-security, this paper introduces the most important  security requirements, which must be fulfilled by today's multimedia systems.  Furthermore, it describes the security measures used to  satisfy these requirements.  These measures are based on modern  cryptographic mechanisms and digital water-marking techniques as  well as on security infrastructures.  20 Refs.

Title: Transparent and robust audio data hiding in cepstrum domain
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel data hiding scheme for audio  signals in cepstrum domain.  Cepstrum representation of audio can be  shown to be very robust to a wide range of attacks including most  challenging time-scaling and pitch-shifting warping.  In cepstrum  domain, we propose to embed data by manipulating statistical mean of selected cepstrum coefficients.  An intuitive psychoacoustic model is employed to control the audibility of introduced distortion.  Our  experiment results have shown that the novel audio data hiding  scheme in cepstrum domain can achieve transparent and robust data  hiding at the capacity region of above 20bps.  10 Refs.

Title: Blind digital watermarking for images and videos and performance  analysis
Abstract: Digital watermarking is a promising technique to help protect data  security and intellectual property rights.  In this paper, a blind  digital image/video watermarking technique is proposed.  A  multiresolution pyramid transform is applied to a host image.  A  tight upper bound for the modulation of watermark signals is derived to control the fidelity loss.  The robustness is optimized under the  fidelity constraints.  Optimum decision rule for the detection is  derived using the statistical model of the generalized Gaussian  distribution.  Asymptotic performance analysis is provided.  The  simulations demonstrate that near perfect invisibility, very strong  robustness, and optimum detection are obtained.  The watermarking  system can be applied to copyright notification, enforcement, and  fingerprinting.  10 Refs.

Title: Video access control via multi-level data hiding
Abstract: This paper proposes novel data hiding algorithms and system design  for high quality digital video.  Instead of targeting on a single  degree of robustness, which results in overestimation and/or  underestimation of the noise conditions, we apply multi-level  embedding to digital video to achieve more than one level of  robustness-capacity tradeoff.  In addition, an adaptive technique is  proposed to determine how many bits are embedded in each part of the video.  Besides user data, control information such as  synchronization and the number of hidden user bits are embedded as  well.  The proposed algorithm can be used for applications such as  access control.  8 Refs.

Title: On the security of the SARI image authentication system
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the image authentication system SARI,  proposed by C.Y.  Lin and S.F.  Chang [1] ,  that distinguishes JPEG compression from malicious manipulations.  In particular, we look at the image digest component of this system.  We show that if multiple images have been authenticated with the same  secret key and the digests of these images are known to an attacker, Oscar, then he can cause arbitrary images to be authenticated with  this same but unknown key.  We show that the number of such images  needed by Oscar to launch a successful attack is quite small, making the attack very practical.  We then suggest possible solutions to  enhance the security of this authentication system.  8 Refs.

Title: Plenary talk: Hidden in Greek manuscripts
Abstract: We present two different examples of hidden information in Ancient  Greek and Byzantine manuscripts.  The first is concerned with  Byzantine palimpsests, which are reused parchments.  The under script of such palimpsests is often much more important than the upper  script.  We present three new methods of reading, identifying, and  studying such under scripts (texts), which are sometimes unknown.   The second is concerned with watermarks in Ancient Green and  Byzantine manuscripts.  In this context, watermarks are not used for  the protection of media, but as the medieval paper makers' means of  indicating the manufacturer and the quality of a specific paper.  The design of these watermarks draws from reflections of daily life and  symbols of religious life.  Watermarks often permit today's  codicological scholars to date paper manuscripts with a precision of half a decade.

Title: Secure blind image steganographic technique using discrete Fourier  transformation
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new steganographic technique for covert  communications.  The technique embeds the hidden information in the  DFT domain after permuting the image pixels in the spatial domain  using a key.  The permutation process introduces randomness into the  cover image and results in a significant increase in the number of  transform coefficients that can be used to transmit the hidden  information.  The hidden information is embedded using quantization  technique.  The perceptual and statistical properties of the cover  and the stego images remain similar for small quantization steps.   The security of the system is examined against known-stego attack.  8 Refs.

Title: A secure watermarking for JPEG-2000
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based  watermarking method, which can be conveniently integrated in  up-comming JPEG-2000 baseline.  Conventional DWT based watermarking  techniques insert a watermark into the coefficients after the  transform completed, while the proposed method inserts a watermark  into the coefficients obtained from ongoing process of lifting for  DWT.  The proposed method allows us to determine selectivity  frequency characteristics of the coefficients where watermark is  embedded, so that the watermark cannot be easily removed or altered  even when filter-banks for DWT was known.  Through the simulations,  we show that the proposed method is more secure and more robust  against various attacks than the conventional DWT based  watermarking.  9 Refs.

Title: A hierarchical image authentication watermark with improved  localization and security
Abstract: Several fragile watermarking schemes presented in the literature are  either vulnerable to vector quantization (VQ) counterfeiting attacks or sacrifice localization accuracy to improve security.  Using a  hierarchical structure, we propose a method that thwarts the VQ  attack while sustaining the superior localization properties of  blockwise independent watermarking methods.  In particular, we  propose dividing the image into blocks in a multi-level hierarchy  and calculating block signatures in this hierarchy.  While signatures of small blocks on the lowest level of the hierarchy ensure superior accuracy of tamper localization, higher level block signatures  provide increasing resistance to VQ attacks.  At the top level, a  signature calculated using the whole image completely thwarts the  counterfeiting attack.  Moreover, "sliding window" searches through  the hierarchy enable the verification of untampered regions after an image has been cropped.  5 Refs.

Title: Hierarchical key assignment without public-key cryptography
Abstract: VLSI chips make possible the hardware devices employed in today's  computing environment for security functions.  Controlling access in  a hierarchy is an interesting research topic in computer security.   Many investigations have been published in the literature with  solutions involving assigning cryptographic keys to users at  different access clearance levels.  However, the existing schemes  require a large number of costly arithmetic operations with large  integers.  This type of system is difficult to implement in a chip  with lower computation ability.  In this paper, we present a  solution, suitable for a low cost chip, to the hierarchical control  problem.  The proposed scheme has promising characteristics such as  high computational efficiency, little required memory in the chip  and low cost implementation.  This method possesses all of the  dynamic properties that appear in existing methods.  27 Refs.

Title: Firewall-based intrusion detection system
Abstract: A network intrusion detection system (IDS) based on firewall was  described.  This system may solve the problem of the traditional IDS  which is lack of the active access control online.  In this model,  time-varying data packets are captured on data link layer, and then  filtered according to the security policy.  Meanwhile, the captured  IP packets are reduced to summary events by the event engine to  represent the important attributes.  After that, these events are  transferred to the intrusion detection module to make intrusion  analysis.  Statistics-based intrusion detection and Naive-Bayes  algorithm were used.  The prototype system based on the model was  implemented and tested in the real network environment.  The system  is good at detecting and controlling the network intrusions with  statistical features in nature.  9 Refs.

Title: Security of Wang et al.'s group-oriented (t,n) threshold signature  schemes with traceable signers
Abstract: A forgery attack on the group-oriented (t,n) threshold signature  schemes was described.  The scheme consists of three phases namely  the initiation, the individual signature generation and verification phase, and the group signature generation and verification phase.  In the Tseng-Jan's (T-J) attack, an attacker without any secret keys of group members can use any previous valid group signature to forge a  valid group signature.  The new attack proved to be more fundamental  than the T-J attack as it could not be recognized or blocked at the  designated clerk level of the signature schemes.  (Edited abstract) 4 Refs.

Title: A protection method against unauthorized access and address spoofing  for open network access systems
Abstract: Modern PCs are becoming increasingly small and portable.  To provide  network access for such mobile PCs, LAN connection points are  appearing in public places such as libraries.  However, it is  difficult to prevent unauthorized network access from these LAN  connection points, and it is especially' difficult to protect  against network attacks that are based on IP and/or MAC address  spoofing.  In this paper, we propose a protection method against  unauthorized network access.

Furthermore, we present a  general key distribution scheme using data embedding for multimedia  multicast.  The performance and system feasibility of the proposed  scheme is also analyzed.  We also extend the key management scheme  for multilayer multimedia applications in heterogeneous networks  where group members have different quality requirements.  17 Refs.

Title: Information hiding technique using optical correlators
Abstract: During the past few years a variety of techniques have emerged to  hide specific information within multimedia data for copyright  protection, tamper-proofing and secret communication.  The schemes  for information hiding that have been proposed so far used either  digital signal processing software or hardware.  So they inevitably  have a problem in some applications like automatic copyright control system, which need fast data-extracting scheme.  In this paper, we  show that the newly proposed optical correlator-based information  hiding system has an advantage in that sense.  In this scheme it is  possible to simultaneously extract all the data hidden in one stego  image and furthermore it is also possible to simultaneously extract  all the data hidden in several stego images using optical  correlators such as matched spatial filter and joint transform  correlator.  14 Refs.

Title: Watermarking 3D geometric models through triangle subdivision
Abstract: Digital water marking, the technique for hiding information into  multimedia contents, is attracting large attentions in the recent  years.  This paper proposes a new water marking technique for 3D  geometric models.  The new algorithm retriangulates a part of a  triangle mesh and embeds the watermark into the positions of the  newly added vertices.  Up to 8 bytes data can be invisibly embedded  into an edge of the triangle mesh without causing any changes to the geometry of the original 3D model.  The embedded watermark resists  affine transformation and can be extracted only from the stego-model without using the original cover model.  10 Refs.

Title: A key transport protocol based on secret sharing an application to  conditional access systems
Abstract: In today's digital world, multimedia content is delivered to homes  via the Internet, satellite, terrestrial and cable networks.   Scrambling is a common approach used by conditional access systems  to prevent unauthorized access to audio/visual data.  The  descrambling keys are securely distributed to the receivers in the  same transmission channel.  Their protection is an important part of  the key management problem.  Although public-key cryptography  provides a viable solution, alternative methods are sought for  economy and efficiency.  This paper presents a key transport protocol based on secret sharing.  It eliminates the need for a cipher, yet  combines the advantages of symmetric and public-key ciphers.  14  Refs.

Title: Efficient multimedia encryption via entropy codec design
Abstract: Efficient encryption algorithms are essential to multimedia data  security, since the data size is large and real-time processing is  often required.  After discussing limitations of previous work on  multimedia encryption, we propose a novel methodology for  confidentiality, which turns entropy coders into encryption ciphers  by using multiple statistical models.  The choise of statistical  models and the order in which they are applied are kept secret as  the key.  Two encryption schemes are constructed by applying this  methodology to the Huffman coder and the QM coder.  It is shown that  security is achieved without sacrificing the compression performance and the computational speed.  The schemes can be applied to most  modern compression systems such as MPEG audio, MPEG video and  JPEG/JPEG2000 image compression.  27 Refs.

Title: Leslie Lamport's properties and actions
Abstract: Since the 1970s, Leslie Lamport has done substantial work on  specification and verification methods.  This work might be regarded  as complementary to his other celebrated research on concurrency and distributed computing, perhaps sometimes even as secondary.  However, this work is excellent in its own right.  It introduces (or distills) many original and useful ideas.  These include the important  definitions of safety and liveness properties, and later the  insightful conception of a temporal logic of actions.  This talk will describe some of Lamport's ideas and results on specification and  verification methods.  It will touch on the impact of some of those  ideas on the speaker (who collaborated closely with Lamport for  several years) and on the field.

Title: Access control in document-centric workflow systems - An agent-based  approach
Abstract: Workflow Systems are increasingly being used to streamline  organizations' business processes.  During the execution of business  processes, information often traverses organizations' networks as  documents.  With the proliferation of the Internet, documents travel  across open networks.  These documents can, however, contain  potentially sensitive information.  The documents used in Workflow  Systems must therefore be protected from unauthorized access.  This  paper enumerates three access control requirements of workflow  environments, including the well-known principle of separation of  duty.  Thereafter the CSAC (Context-sensitive Access Control) model  is presented to address the requirements.  In conclusion it is  demonstrated how this model can be implemented in an agent-based  architecture.  6 Refs.

Title: Method of attacking a new Diffie-Hellman like public-key scheme
Abstract: Guang Gong and Lein Harn proposed a new Diffie-Hellman public-key  distribution scheme that is based on third-order linear feedback  shift register sequences over GF(p) and its security is based on the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm in GF(p**3).  However, a method for attacking the scheme is presented in this paper.  Despite  that the method could not break up it fully, it indicates that the  security of the scheme is likely to be not being based on the  difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm in GF(p**3).  With this  method, we have also obtained the weak private keys of the scheme.   11 Refs.

Title: Events in Haskell, and how to implement them
Abstract: We describe a new and simpler implementation in Haskell of CML's  events, which encode reactions by a thread to combinations of  messages from other threads.  We add a new type of Guarded Events, by which recipients can filter messages with conditions on their value  known as Guards.  We implement guarded channels.  The guard type and  the indexing algorithm are not part of the channel definition, so  that the user can trade off what guards are required against the  cost of indexing.  As an example we sketch the encapsulation of a  graphical user interface toolkit.  This can be done concisely not  only because of guarded events, but also because we construct events monadically.  Monadic events are especially helpful for representing  concurrent processes which transform themselves in reaction to  external communications.  28 Refs.

Title: The evolving field of distributed storage
Abstract: The evolution of storage and network technologies in the field of  distributed storage was analyzed.  The distributed data storage  services distribute data replicas or erasure-resilient fragments to  a diverse set of nodes ensuring availability and long-term data  survivability.  Napster, Gnutella, Mojo Nation, Freenet are  peer-to-peer file-sharing systems in which many nodes contribute  storage and network resources to build an available pool of files,  and which of the files to keep and evict over a period of time is  decided by each of the individual nodes.  The Free Haven system  targets anonimity, censorship resistance and guaranteed availability of each document, and it includes a novel reputation system for  servers and a file-trading mechanism.

Title: Internet communications
Abstract: The various network security issues such as denial of service  attacks, viruses, lack of inherent network security, and human  error/fraud were analyzed.  The servers should be secured and the  packets of data should be filtered at the point of connection to the internet to prevent forged source addresses.  A firewall is vital as  it is a mechanism for enforcing policy, and it is also important for network management as it can provide a single choke point to impose  security and audit.  The companies can create a secure and trusted  environment by adopting a clearly defined policy, enabling the  employees to communicate freely with it and securely open up their  network sections to partners and clients.

Title: VLSI implementation of high performance burst mode for 128-bit block  ciphers
Abstract: A new cipher mode, called the burst mode, is devised dedicatedly for  the high performance implementation of Advanced Encryption Standard  (AES) and other next generation 128-bit block cipher algorithms.  In  comparison with the conventional modes, the burst mode achieves a  considerable increase in the throughput by employing a novel stream  cipher mechanism which can encrypt 64 plaintext blocks through 16  times of block cipher encryptions.  Experimental results show that  the VLSI implementation of the burst mode with the use of a hardware accelerator, where AES is performed by software, raises the speed of the software implementation by four times, achieving the maximum  rate of 1.3 Gbps.  10 Refs.

Title: Information security and data protection
Abstract: The use of the Internet and networked computers has changed the  computing environment significantly.  While providing convenience,  the systems are also more vulnerable to security threats.  This  article discusses actions that may be taken to enhance security.  A  comprehensive analysis should be conducted to identify resources  that need to be protected.  The resources should be classified  according to the sensitivity level of information.  A cost-benefit  analysis should be performed to determine the level of security  precautions that should be taken.  Since it is impossible to have  perfect security, consideration should be given to contingency  planning and recovery.  If security is compromised, the organization  should be able to recover quickly and minimize damages.

Title: SARI: Self-Authentication-and-Recovery Image watermarking system
Abstract: In this project, we designed a novel image authentication system  based on our semi-fragile watermarking technique.  The system, called SARI, can accept quantization-based lossy compression to a  determined degree without any false alarm and can sensitively detect and locate malicious manipulations.  It's the first system that has  such capability in distinguishing malicious attacks from acceptable  operations.  Furthermore, the corrupted area can be approximately  recovered by the information hidden in the image.  The amount of  information embedded in our SARI system has nearly reached the  theoretical maximum zero-error information hiding capacity of  digital images.  The software prototype includes two parts - the  watermark embedder that's freely distributed and the authenticator  that can be deployed online as a third-party service or used in the  recipient side.  3 Refs.

Title: An image watermarking technique using pyramid transform
Abstract: An image watermarking technique based on pyramid transforms is  proposed.  An arbitrary binary pattern is formed into an effective  hypothesized pattern and transmitted as a watermark.  Multiresolution pyramid transforms are applied to host images, whose characteristics are exploited to embed the watermark.  The detector is designed to be effective to a wide range of original signal sources and noise  sources.  The scheme is designed to achieve efficient trade-offs  between perceptual invisibility, robustness and trustworthy  detection.  The experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique  has high imperceptibility, good robustness, and accurate detection.   It can be applied to copyright notification, enforcement, and  fingerprinting.  30 Refs.

Title: Tamper resistant software: Extending trust into a hostile environment
Abstract: In this paper we illustrate how Tamper Resistant Software or TRS, can within a temporal window extend trust into a hostile environment  such as mobile devices and set top boxes.  We state and reference our approach to TRS and illustrate a high level attack.  We currently  estimate that it would take a Class II attacker a month to reverse  engineer the TRS we can automatically produce from an existing  program.  This is based on Data Flow encoding only.  With Control Flow encoding and improved Data Flow encodings we expect the attack times to exceed a year.  6 Refs.

Title: Security awareness in service discovery for multimedia collaboration
Abstract: Multimedia capable devices for professional and private use grow  digital these days.  With the advent of short-range wireless  communication capabilities, these devices gain new potentials such  as enabling seamless collaboration within groups of devices.  As a  side effect of these technologies, new problems emerge, spatially in the area of security.  This paper focuses on security issues to form  (peer)groups among these devices.  Our primary goal is to establish  security awareness via the service discovery process.  We show that  the combination of the pure Internet Protocol and today's state of  the art service discovery protocols lack the necessary features for  solving the problem described.  We introduce a novel design of a  service discovery system as a solution for security aware ad-hoc  usage.  13 Refs.

Abstract: Fingerprints have been used to recognize people for several decades.   The advent of low cost inkless fingerprint scanners coupled with  extra compute power available in client workstations, biometrics in  general and fingerprints in particular are being considered for many secure authentication applications.  Lotus Notes is a groupware  supporting email access and other activities such as calendar  management included in it.  In this paper, we describe the  architecture of a system that integrates both the high security of  Notes with conveniences of fingerprints for client authentication.   Several design challenges have been addressed that have led to a  successful system design and development.  6 Refs.

Title: Reliable detection of LSB steganography in color and grayscale images
Abstract: A large number of commercial stenographic programs use the Least  Significant Bit embedding (LSB) as the method of choice for message  hiding in 24-bit, 8-bit color images, and grayscale images.  It is  commonly believed that changes to the LSBs of colors cannot be  detected due to noise that is always present in digital images.  In  this paper, we describe a new very accurate and reliable method that can detect LSB embedding in randomly scattered pixels in both 24-bit color images and 8-bit grayscale or color images.  It is based on our previous work on lossless data embedding [1 right  bracket .  By inspecting the differences in the number of regular and singular groups for the LSB and the "shifted LSB plane", we can  reliably detect messages as short as 0.03bpp.  9 Refs.

Title: A new technique for authentication of image/video for multimedia  applications
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new image/video authentication system  based on the digital signature technique.  The proposed digital  signature is composed of visually important and compression-tolerant features in images/videos.  In the authentication process, the  features of each block being evaluated are compared with the  corresponding features of the block recorded in the digital  signature.  Authenticity is granted if the similarity is high enough.  The experimental results show that the proposed techniques are not  only efficient to protect security and integrity of multimedia data, but also are flexible and feasible for real applications.  11 Refs.

Title: An additive approach to transform-domain information hiding and  optimum detection structure
Abstract: This paper presents an additive approach to transform-domain  information hiding and the performance analysis for images and  video.  The watermark embedding method is designed to satisfy the  perceptual constraints and improve the detectability as well as the  information embedding rate.  The statistical behaviors of subband  coefficients are modeled by the generalized Gaussian distribution.   The structure of the optimum detection is built and the performance  of the exact asymptotic detection is evaluated using large deviation theory.  Our approach can not only achieve good transparency but also precisely control the detection errors.  It can be applied to  watermarking, authentication, fingerprinting, and steganography.  40  Refs.

Title: Visual cryptography based on optical interference encryption  technique
Abstract: In this paper, we proposed a new visual cryptography scheme based on  optical interference that can improve the contrast and signal to  noise ratio (SNR) of reconstructed images when compared to  conventional visual cryptography methods.  The binary image being  encrypted is divided into any number of n slides.  For encryption,  (n-1) randomly independent keys are generated along with another  random key based on an XOR process of (n-1) random keys.  The XOR  process between each divided image and each random key produces the  encryption of n encrypted images.  These encrypted images are then  used to make encrypted binary phase masks.  For decryption, the phase masks are placed on the paths of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.  6  Refs.

Title: A method for designing secure solutions
Abstract: The task of developing information technology (IT) solutions that  consistently and effectively apply security principles has many  challenges, including: the complexity of integrating the specified  security functions within the several underlying component  architectures found in computing systems, the difficulty in  developing a comprehensive set of baseline requirements for  security, and a lack of widely accepted security design methods.   With the formalization of security evaluation criteria into an  international standard known as Common Criteria, one of the barriers to a common approach for developing extensible IT security  architectures has been lowered; however, more work remains.  This  paper describes a systematic approach for defining, modeling, and  documenting security functions within a structured design process in order to facilitate greater trust in the operation of resulting IT  solutions.  18 Refs.

Title: Cryptographic key assignment scheme for overcoming the incorrectness  of the CHW scheme
Abstract: Based on the Newton interpolation method and a predefined one-way  function, a cryptographic key assignment scheme, called the CHW  scheme, in a user hierarchy was presented by Chang et al. in 1992.   The CHW scheme did not need the large amount of storage needed in  the Akl-Taylor scheme.  However, two counter-examples have been  presented to prove the incorrectness of the CHW scheme, and further  two modified versions of the CHW scheme were also proven to be  insecure.  Owing to these problems, a simple scheme is proposed to  overcome the incorrectness and to enhance the security of the CHW  scheme.  15 Refs.

Title: Biometrics - Real identities fora virtual world
Abstract: Biometric methods offer an alternative approach to authentication of  individuals, using distinctive physical features of the body (such  as fingerprints) or characteristic actions of people (e.g. digitised forms of written signatures).  Although systems have been available  for over thirty years, there is now a sound understanding of how  they can be used to best effect, based upon continued research  studies, experience gained in trials and deployments, and the  development of cheaper and smaller devices.  The activities of  standardisation bodies point to the increasing maturity of these  technologies.  However, widespread use of biometric methods will  depend upon other factors, e.g. strong business cases that justify  whole life costs against the total costs of ownership of existing  authentication methods, and the acceptance of such methods by  consumers, citizens and employees.  24 Refs.

Title: Attacks and solutions on strong-password authentication
Abstract: A password-based mechanism is the most widely used method of  authentication in distributed environments.  However, because people  are used to choosing easy-to-remember passwords, so-called  "weak-passwords," dictionary attacks on them can succeed.  The  techniques used to prevent dictionary attacks lead to a heavy  computational load.  Indeed, forcing people to use well-chosen  passwords, so-called "strong passwords," with the assistance of  tamper-resistant hardware devices can be regarded as another fine  authentication solution.  In this paper, we examine a recent  solution, the SAS protocol, and demonstrate that it is vulnerable to replay and denial of service attacks.  We also propose an Optimal  Strong-Password Authentication (OSPA) protocol that is secure  against stolen-verifier, replay, and denial of service attacks, and  minimizes computation, storage, and transmission overheads.  18 Refs.

Title: A trend analysis of exploitations
Abstract: We have conducted an empirical study of a number of computer security exploits and determined that the rates at which incidents involving  the exploit are reported to the CERT can be modeled using a common  mathematical framework.  Data associated with three significant  exploits involving vulnerabilities in phf, imap, and bind can all be modeled using the formula C = I + S multiplied by root M where C is  the cumulative count of reported incidents, M is the time since the  start of the exploit cycle, and I and S are the regression  coefficients determined by analysis of the incident report data.   Further analysis of two additional exploits involving  vulnerabilities in mountd and statd confirm the model.  We believe  that the models will aid in predicting the severity of subsequent  vulnerability exploitations, based on the rate of early incident  reports.  18 Refs.

Title: Performance of public-key-enabled Kerberos authentication in large  networks
Abstract: Several proposals have been made to public-key-enable various stages  of the secret-key-based Kerberos network authentication protocol.   The computational requirements of public key cryptography are much  higher than those of secret key cryptography, and the substitution  of public key encryption algorithms for secret key algorithms  impacts performance.  This paper uses closed, class-switching  queueing models to demonstrate the quantitative performance  differences between PKCROSS and PKTAPP-two proposals for  public-key-enabling Kerberos.  Our analysis shows that, while PKTAPP  is more efficient for authenticating to a single server, PKCROSS  outperforms the simpler protocol if there are two or more remote  servers per remote realm.  This heuristic can be used to guide a  high-level protocol that combines both methods of authentication to  improve performance.  31 Refs.

Title: SD3: A trust management system with certified evaluation
Abstract: We introduce SD3, a trust management system consisting of a  high-level policy language, a local policy evaluator, and a  certificate retrieval system.  A unique feature of SD3 is its  certified evaluator: as the evaluator computes the answer to a  query, it also computes a proof that the answer follows from the  security policy.  Before the answer is returned, the proof is passed  through a simple checker, and incorrect proofs are reported as  errors.  The certified evaluator reduces the trusted computing base  and greatly increases our confidence that the answers produced by  the evaluator follow from the specification, despite complex  optimizations.  To illustrate SD3's capabilities, we show how to  implement a secure name service, similar to DNSSEC, entirely in SD3.  25 Refs.

Title: Preserving information flow properties under refinement
Abstract: In a stepwise development process, it is essential that system  properties that have been already investigated in some phase need  not be re-investigated in later phases.  In formal developments, this corresponds to the requirement that properties are preserved under  refinement.  While safety and liveness properties are indeed  preserved under most standard forms of refinement, It is well known  that this is, in general, not true for information flow properties,  a large and useful class of security properties.  In this article, we propose a collection of refinement operators as a solution to this  problem.  We prove that these operators preserve information flow as  well as other system properties.  Thus, information flow properties  become compatible with stepwise development.  Moreover, we show that  our operators are an optimal solution.  20 Refs.

Title: Data mining methods for detection of new malicious executables
Abstract: A serious security threat today is malicious executables, especially  new, unseen malicious executables often arriving as email  attachments.  These new malicious executables are created at the rate of thousands every year and pose a serious security threat.  Current  anti-virus systems attempt to detect these new malicious programs  with heuristics generated by hand.  This approach is costly and  oftentimes ineffective.  In this paper, we present a data-mining  framework that detects new, previously unseen malicious executables  accurately and automatically.  The data-mining framework  automatically found patterns in our data set and used these patterns to detect a set of new malicious binaries.  Comparing our detection  methods with a traditional signature-based method, our method more  than doubles the current detection rates for new malicious  executables.  27 Refs.

Title: The hidden meta-requirements of security and privacy
Abstract: When collecting requirements for software, designers may learn of  needs for specific forms of protection to be present.  These needs  may be translated into requirements for encryption or  authentication.  But what about the non-obvious aspects of security - including privacy, auditability, and assurance - that are usually  overlooked in the requirements capture process? When we overlook  these issues, we get software that doesn't deserve our trust.  In  this talk, I'll discuss some of the aspects of security that are  regularly overlooked by designers, and suggest some standard  questions that should be addressed in every design.

Title: Confidentiality-preserving refinement
Abstract: We develop a condition for confidentiality-preserving refinement  which is both necessary and sufficient.  Using a slight extension of  CSP as notation, we give a toy example to illustrate the usefulness  of our condition.  Systems are specified by their behavior and a  window.  For an abstract system, the window specifies what  information is allowed to be observed by its environment.  For a  concrete system, the window specifies what information cannot be  hidden front its environment.  A concrete system is a  confidentiality-preserving refinement of an abstract system, if it  behaviorally refines the abstract system and if the information  revealed by the concrete window is allowed to be revealed according  to the abstract window.  21 Refs.

Title: Confined mobile functions
Abstract: We introduce a higher-order language called Confined-lambda which  combines a functional sequential core with primitives for  distributed computation.  Confined-lambda adopts a communication  model based on synchronous message passing along channels.  We focus  on the problem of giving programmers control over the flow of values created by their programs.  We show that by using a type-based  approach a value can be forced to remain within the boundaries of a  particular subsystem - a mobility region - specified by the  programmer.  The static type system presented in this paper  guarantees that the values of well-typed Confined-lambda programs  will be confined to their specified mobility regions at run-time.  29 Refs.

Title: Logical relations for encryption (extended abstract)
Abstract: The theory of relational parametricity and its logical relations  proof technique are powerful tools for reasoning about information  hiding in the polymorphic lambda-calculus.  We investigate the  application of these tools in the security do-main by defining a  cryptographic lambda-calculus - an extension of the standard simply  typed lambda-calculus with primitives for encryption, decryption,  and key generation-and introducing logical relations for this  calculus that can be used to prove behavioral equivalences between  programs that rely on encryption.  We illustrate the framework by  encoding some simple security protocols, including the  Needham-Schroeder public-key protocol.  We give a natural account of  the well-known attack on the original protocol and a straightforward proof that the improved variant of the protocol is secure.  26 Refs.

Title: Log auditing through model-checking
Abstract: Log auditing is a basic intrusion detection mechanism, whereby  attacks are detected by uncovering matches of sequences of events  against signatures.  We argue that this is naturally expressed as a  model-checking problem against linear Kripke models.  A variant of  the classic linear time temporal logic of Manna and Pnueli with  first-order variables is first investigated in this framework.  But  this logic is in dire need of refinement, as far as expressiveness  and efficiency are concerned.  We therefore propose a second, less  standard logic consisting of flat, Wolper-style linear-time  formulae.  We describe an efficient on-line algorithm, making the  approach attractive for complex log auditing tasks.  We also present  a few optimizations that the use of a formal semantics affords us.   22 Refs.

Title: Computing symbolic models for verifying cryptographic protocols
Abstract: We consider the problem of automatically verifying infinite-state  cryptographic protocols.  Specifically, we present an algorithm that  given a finite process describing a protocol in a hostile  environment (trying to force the system into a "bad" state) computes a model of traces on which security properties can be checked.   Because of unbounded inputs from the environment, even finite  processes have att infinite set of traces; the main focus of our  approach is the reduction of this infinite set to a finite set by a  symbolic analysis of the knowledge of the environment.  Our algorithm is sound (and we conjecture complete) for protocols with shared-key  encryption/decryption that use arbitrary messages as keys; further  it is complete in the common and important case in which the  cryptographic keys are messages of bounded size.  25 Refs.

Title: Authenticity by typing for security protocols
Abstract: We propose a new method to check authenticity properties of  cryptographic protocols.  First, code up the protocol in the  spi-calculus of Abadi and Gordon.  Second, specify authenticity  properties by annotating the code with correspondence assertions in  the style of Woo and Lam.  Third, figure out types for the keys,  nonces, and messages of the protocol.  Fourth, check that the  spi-calculus code is well-typed according to a novel type and effect system presented in this paper.  Our main theorem guarantees that  any, well-typed protocol is robustly safe, that is, its  correspondence assertions are true in the presence of any opponent  expressible in spi.  39 Refs.

Title: A generic approach to the security of multi-threaded programs
Abstract: The security of computation at the level of a specific programming  language and the security of complex systems at a more abstract  level are two major areas of current security research.  With the  objective to integrate the two, this article proposes a translation  of a timing-sensitive security property for simple multi-threaded  programs into a more general security framework.  Interestingly, our  notion of security for programs is bisimulation-based while the  security framework is trace-based.  Nevertheless, we show that the  translation is sound and complete in the sense that the trace-based  specification which results from the translation of a multi-threaded program is secure if and only if the original program is secure.  The translation is presented as a two-step process where the first step  is independent from the concrete programming language.  34 Refs.

Practical implementation as a rule in the rule base of our NMS has  verified that the rule can detect not only attacks on network, but  also other unusual behaviors.  13 Refs.

Abstract: In this paper, we are going to show how to build up agent-oriented  Public Key Infrastructure(PKI) from SPKI/SDSI and X.509 standards.  A variety of delegation mechanisms for agents will be demonstrated  under this agent-oriented PKI.  The mechanisms include: chain-ruled,  threshold, and conditional.  The lack of agent security management  standards did not allow us to do the agent trust and delegation in  legalized manner so we proposed several new communicative acts to  satisfy our agent delegation management.  Finally, we briefly show  how to implement these agent communication language and inner  content language in XML and XML/RDF.  30 Refs.

Title: Tempus Fugit and the need for an e-Social Contract
Abstract: For autonomous agents to achieve their full potential they require  access to detailed private information.  The time is rapidly  approaching when we can build systems to gather this information and monitor all aspects of an individual's life.  In this paper we  describe Tempus Fugit (Time Flies), an attempt to create just such a system.  The reality of this technology has enormous social  implications and, misused, it creates direct threats to liberty.  We  further describe an "e-Social Contract", a design philosophy  developed to safeguard against these threats.  It is the foundation  of the design philosophy behind Tempus Fugit and should be  considered in the development of any agent technology.  10 Refs.

Title: Evaluacion de dos esquemas de seguridad para agentes moviles   Evaluation of two security schemes for mobile agents
Abstract: In this article, we submit and compare two different but  complementary approaches to the problem of protecting mobile agents  in untrusted computing environments.  The first alternative, a  technique for protection of mobile agents built upon an asymmetric  cryptographic system resistant to conventional cryptoanalysis  techniques, is based on the application of one-time keys.  The second solution, geared towards computing environments supporting  public-key cryptographic systems, permits the simultaneous  protection of the code and data areas of mobile agents that travel  in an information network.  This latter protection mechanism can be  implemented using any asymmetric cryptosystem.  We believe the  protection strategies we have developed in our investigation are the first complete solution for the protection of mobile agents in  distributed computing environments.  14 Refs.

Title: Issues in message passing for a tele-immersive experience
Abstract: Tele-immersion is one of the applications being developed in  conjunction with the Internet-2 initiative.  Most of the research in  this area has focused on issues pertaining to image acquisition and  display, tracking technologies, robotics, haptics, etc. In order to  maintain consistency of a tele-immersive experience one also needs  to develop a suit of solutions that will ensure proper coordination  between the participants.  This will require protocols for real-time  causal delivery of messages while maintaining the privacy of  conversations and preventing forgery of message contents.  This paper discusses these issues while considering a tele-immersive  environment as a distributed message passing system.  18 Refs.

In particular, when the typical number of  bases t = 2, the proposed method is four times faster than the  simultaneous multiple exponentiation method, a well known fast  method for multiple scalar multiplication.  Furthermore, the proposed method can change the amount of time and memory to fit various  platform environment (e.g., personal computers as rich ones or  mobile devices such as smartcards as poor ones) by adjusting the  division bit width (division unit).

Title: Computer network intrusion detection software development
Abstract: Recent proliferation of computer network usage for business and  communication has witnessed an alarming rate of intrusion.  The  phenomenon is a grave concern in academic environment since  universities seldom have tight security measures and the high  bandwidth available make them interesting targets as attack relay  hosts.  The software development process adopted open source  approaches where a simple open source implementation of network  intrusion detection is improved to tailor the needs in Universiti  Kebangsaan Malaysia campus.  The working prototype is then tested on  real life implementation in the university environment for  detecting, logging and alerting computer network intrusion.  (Author  abstract) 7 Refs.

Title: Hardware architecture for data concealment using sub-band coding, LSB coding and pseudo-random bit stream generators
Abstract: Data concealment using sub-band LSB coding, LSB coding is an  algorithm exhibiting good performance for hiding data within audio.   This paper reports on the VLSI implementation techniques used for  the algorithm.  The implementation has both analogue input/output and digital audio input/output to interface to audio equipment, such as  DAT, amplifier, audio precision analyzer and similar.  The  architecture has been designed to give real time performance and  consequently has high efficiency, whilst maintaining audio fidelity  through careful analysis of wordlength and other effects.  In this  paper, we also present the design study on investigating the  feasibility of the selected implementation approach and estimate  major system parameters.  (Author abstract) 5 Refs.

Title: Integrating public key cryptography into the Simple Network  Management Protocol (SNMP) framework
Abstract: Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is widely used for remote  network resource management due to its simplicity and distributed  management capabilities.  However, the increased use of SNMP to  manage and control network resources such as routers and servers  also introduces security risks whereby unauthorized users can  retrieve information or modify the given resources remotely.  The  basic security framework introduced in SNMPv3 only specifies the use of symmetric cryptography techniques to address the security  concerns.  This paper outlines a new methodology, Public-Key Security Model (PSM), to integrate public cryptography techniques into the  SNMP framework.  It extends the existing User-based Security Model  (USM) to include per-session authentication and encryption keys,  thus enhancing the security of the SNMPv3 protocol.  (Author  abstract) 10 Refs.

Title: A fast finite field multiplier architecture for high-security  cryptographic applications
Abstract: As an indispensable part of modern consumer electronics, security  applications such as smart cards and network securities play an  important role.  In fact, data security gets ever increasing  attention as people tend to communicate with each other by various  electronic devices over networks.  In this paper, a new approach on  designing a finite field multiplier architecture is proposed.  The  proposed architecture trades reduction in the number of clock cycles with resources.  This architecture features high performance, simple  structure, scalability and independence on the choice of the finite  field to provide maximum security, to applications so thai it can be applied to various fields of security-demanding consumer electronic  applications.  4 Refs.

Title: Watermarking of SAT using combinatorial isolation lemmas
Abstract: Watermarking of hardware and software designs is an effective  mechanism for intellectual property protection (IPP).  Two important  criteria for watermarking schemes are credibility and fairness.  In  this paper, we present the unique solution-based watermarking  technique which provides, in a sense, the ultimate answer to both  credibility and fairness requirements.  Leveraging on a combinatorial theorem of Valiant and Vazirani, we demonstrate how ultimate  credibility and complete fairness can almost always be achieved with high probability during the watermarking of the solution of the  satisfiability (SAT) problem.  The effectiveness of the technique is  demonstrated on both specially created examples where the number of  solutions is known, as well as on common CAD and operation research  SAT instances.  21 Refs.

Title: Video watermarking content protection technology
Abstract: A new video watermarking technology with advanced features was  described.  This watermark embedding process incorporated a secret  key for detection of the transmitted content, the telecasting  channel and time period of telecast.  The format of the digital  signal did not change and no additional bandwidth was required in  this process.  The extra information was incorporated by little  modifications to the pixel intensities in the active video part.  The additional data was recovered by the watermark detector using  digital signal processing algorithms.  Its enormous versatality, ease of installation, integration and production made it popular for  video watermarking.  (Edited abstract)

Title: Bernoulli shift generated chaotic watermarks: Theoretic investigation
Abstract: The paper statistically analyzes the behaviour of chaotic watermark  signals generated by n-way Bernoulli shift maps.  For this purpose, a simple blind copyright protection watermarking system is considered.  The analysis involves theoretical evaluation of the system detection reliability, when a correlator detector is used.  The aim of the  paper is twofold: (i) to introduce the n-way Bernoulli shift  generated chaotic watermarks and theoretically contemplate their  properties with respect to detection reliability and (ii) to  theoretically establish their potential superiority against the  widely used pseudorandom watermarks.  Experimental verification of  the theoretical analysis results is also performed.  7 Refs.

Title: Set partitioning in oblivious data hiding
Abstract: In oblivious steganography, host noise suppression is a great concern as the watermark signal energy is usually much less than that of the host signal.  In this paper, we model the data hiding as a more  general H0/H1 hypothesis testing problem.  Decision making is based  on the statistical distinction between H0 and H1.  A simple embedding scheme, viz., set partitioning, is proposed.  The coefficients are  divided into two sets to represent bit value 1 and 0. The average  distortion introduced is calculated.  Its optimum and suboptimal  detection is discussed in detail.  Analysis and simulation studies  show improvement over existing schemes.  5 Refs.

Title: Specification and enforcement of object-oriented RBAC model
Abstract: Access control for protection and sharing of information and physical resources is an essential component of any multi-user computer  systems.  Role-Based-Access-Control (RBAC) has been introduced and  has offered a powerful means of specifying access control decisions, as well as reducing the cost of administrating access control  policies and making them less error-prone.  In this paper, we  proposed an object-oriented RBAC model (ORBAC) and its formal  specifications to describe the relationships of the basic elements  of the model.  Furthermore, an efficient ORBAC implementation method  was proposed to deal with statically and dynamically role  authorization so that the problem of seperation of duties can be  solved.  8 Refs.

Title: A new key-lock method for user authentication and access control
Abstract: We propose a new key-lock method for user authentication and access  control based on Chinese remainder theorem, the concepts of the  access control matrix, key-lock-pair, time stamp, and the NS public  key protocol.  Our method is dynamic and needs a minimum amount of  computation in the sense that it only updates at most one key/lock  for each access request.  We also demonstrate how an authentication  protocol can be integrated into the access control method.  By  applying a time stamp, the method can not only withstand replay  attack, but also strengthen the authenticating mechanism, which  could not be achieved simultaneously in previous key-lock methods.  8 Refs.

Title: A new group signature scheme and its performance
Abstract: Group signatures allow every member of a group to sign some given  messages on behalf of the group anonymously.  Only a designated group manager can open a signature to reveal the identity of the signer.   To the best of our knowledge, all known group signature solutions  have some undesirable properties.  In this paper, we propose a new  group signature scheme combining linear codes and known digital  signature methods.  This scheme possesses all group signature  properties including coalition-resistance, and can be implemented  easily.  The security of this signature scheme is determined by the  difficulty of discrete logarithm problem over finite fields.  10  Refs.

Title: A blind watermarking technique using wavelet transform
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an effective watermarking algorithm for  copyright protection.  This is a blind watermarking which can confirm the copyright without original image.  The original image is  transformed using wavelet transform and flags are created with the  secret key.  The secret key is the thing we need to extract the flags and compare this extracted flags with the original flags that is  created during watermark embedding procedure.  To criticize the  robustness of this scheme we compared the extracted flag with the  original flag after several attack such as JPEG compression,  collusion, resize and noise addition.  The results show that the  proposed watermarking algorithm has excellent robustness against  various watermark attacks with the high quality of the watermarked  image.  9 Refs.

Title: An approach for secure multicasting in mobile IP networks
Abstract: There is a considerable interest in the area of mobility with the  advent of powerful portable computing devices such as laptops and  other information appliances.  These enable a user to access a  service from anywhere at any time.  Such nomadic computing poses  several challenges in multicasting and security.  We first consider a framework that has been proposed by Acharya et al. [ Acharya, A., Bakre, A. and Badrinath, B. R. IP multicast extension  for mobile internet working, Rutger DCS Technical Report,  LCSR-TR  243.] for multicasting in mobile IP networks.   In this paper, we extend this framework to support a secure  multicasting service.  We describe secure schemes for a mobile host  to initiate, join and leave a multicast group.  We also discuss the  secure movement of mobile hosts in intra and inter campus  environments.  12 Refs.

Abstract: A novel generalized group-oriented cryptosystem with authenticated  sender is proposed.  The proposed generalized group-oriented system  integrates the design idea of authenticated encryption scheme.  In  the proposed system, a secret message can be addressed to a  specified authorized group, and the receiving authorized group has  the ability to decrypt the secret message and authenticate the  sender.  For achieving both privacy and integrity in data  communications, the proposed generalized group-oriented system  requires smaller bandwidth as compared to the previously proposed  generalized group-oriented systems.  The security of the proposed  system is based on the difficulty of computing the discrete  logarithm problem.  11 Refs.

Title: Undeniable cryptographic protocol for both sender and receiver and  its applications
Abstract: In data communications, digital signature schemes are used to ensure  non-repudiation of sending data and the integrality of data, and  non-repudiation of receiving data is also very important in the  secret communication.  In the past years, this kind of cryptographic  protocols was mainly implemented by the intervention of the trusted  third party in transmission and encryption of data, thus the  dependability and security of the trusted third party was a  bottleneck in these secure systems.  To solve this problem, an  undeniable cryptographic protocol for both sender and receiver is  proposed, which is more efficient.  Finally, its applications in  electric mail are discussed.  5 Refs.

This protocol is based on  decentralized group key management with only one key shared among  group members.  We use then Network Simulator, ns-2, in order to  evaluate the performance of our protocol in the case of group  initialization, and compare it with SKDC approaches.  23 Refs.

Title: Defense against man-in-the-middle attack in client-server systems
Abstract: The deployment of several client-server applications over the  Internet and emerging networks requires the establishment of the  client's integrity.  This is necessary for the protection of  copyright of distributed material and, in general, for protection  from loss of "sensitive" (secret) information.  Clients are  vulnerable to powerful man-in-the-middle attacks through viruses,  which are undetectable by conventional anti-virus technology.  We  describe such powerful viruses and show their ability to lead to  compromised clients, that cannot protect copyrighted or "sensitive"  information.  We introduce a methodology based on simple hardware  devices, called "spies", which enables servers to establish client  integrity, and leads to a successful defense against viruses that  use man-in-the-middle attacks.  5 Refs.

Title: An online credential repository for the Grid: MyProxy
Abstract: Grid Portals, based on standard Web technologies, are increasingly  used to provide user interfaces for Computational and Data Grids.   However, such Grid Portals do not integrate cleanly with existing  Grid security systems such as the Grid Security Infrastructure  (GSI), due to lack of delegation capabilities in Web security  mechanisms.  We solve this problem using an online credentials  repository system, called MyProxy.  MyProxy allows Grid Portals to  use the GSI to interact with Grid resources in a standard, secure  manner.  We examine the requirements of Grid Portals, give an  overview of the GSI, and demonstrate how MyProxy enables them to  function together.  The architecture and security of the MyProxy  system are described in detail.  16 Refs.

Title: Active ingress monitoring (AIM): An intrusion isolation scheme in  active networks
Abstract: Denial of Service (DoS) attacks have proven to be a challenging issue for the Internet community.  In this paper we present a novel  approach, Active Ingress Monitoring (AIM), to effectively isolate  DoS attacks that use randomly forged source IP addresses.  Unlike the existing approaches, AIM reduces the computational overloads by  executing the monitoring and filtering operations on selected packet streams only when needed.  In addition, our scheme does not require  complicated requirements or mandatory participation from every  individual network in the Internet.  AIM is based on the Active  Networks environment and operates in the network layer based on  passive traffic monitoring.  12 Refs.

Abstract: Content aware networking is a new paradigm in which the network is  intelligent to understand the type of content request, where to find it, and how to deliver it in an efficient way.  We discuss, why the  existing IP-smart paradigm does not meet the needs of todays content rich Internet.  We describe content aware networking issues that  include content storage across distributed servers, content based  routing, content delivery, content distribution and content based  resource reservation.  Content delivery is often associated with  multicast and we present various multicast techniques by which a  content can be delivered efficiently.  The emerging end-to-end IP  Security (IPSec) poses some unique challenge to this trend and we  present few solutions to overcome the problem.  13 Refs.

Title: Ethernet Wrapper: Extension of the TCP wrapper
Abstract: One of the popular network security programs supporting host access  control is the 'TCP Wrapper' [13] .  TCP  Wrapper is a software-only system and many computers connected to  the Internet are using it.  But, TCP Wrapper does 'IP address-based'  access control.  IP address is not such a reliable source when  authenticating a host.  In this paper, we point out two possible  attacks against the TCP Wrapper, propose a new way to prevent them,  and describe the prototype implementation, Ethernet Wrapper.  By  adding an 'ethernet address check', we augmented the TCP Wrapper.   The test results showed that Ethernet Wrapper can prevent such  attacks effectively.  13 Refs.

Title: Information flow control in role-based model for distributed objects
Abstract: Various kinds of distributed applications are realized in  object-based frameworks.  Object-based technologies are used to  design applications and enhance the interoperability among  applications.  In addition to realizing the interoperability, the  system is required to be secure.  The secure system is required to  not only protect objects from illegally manipulated but also illegal information flow among objects.  In this paper, we discuss a  role-based access control model in the object-based systems and how  to resolve illegal information flow in the roles.  We define a safe  set of roles where no illegal information flow occurs.  We discuss an algorithm to check if illegal information flow occurs.  In addition,  we discuss how to safety perform transactions belonging to unsafe  roles.  21 Refs.

Title: A new encryption algorithm for image cryptosystems
Abstract: There are two major differences of the characteristics of the text  data and image data.  One difference is that the size of image data  is usually much larger than that of text data.  The other is that  plain data rarely permit loss when a compression technique is used,  but image data do.  In this paper, we design an efficient  cryptosystem for images.  Our method is based on vector quantization, which is one of the popular image compression techniques.  Our method can achieve the following two goals.  One goal is to design a high  security image cryptosystem.  The other goal is to reduce  computational complexity of the encryption and decryption  algorithms. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Title: Securing images online: A protection mechanism that does not involve  watermarking
Abstract: The paper covers a method of allowing a client to browse an image to  examine it in detail, while making it difficult to steal.  It differs from invisible watermarking methods in that it attempts to prevent  theft, rather than detect or verify theft after it has happened.  The image is served to the client in parts.  The parts are imperceptibly  altered.  No effort is made to protect individual parts; however, the alterations ensure that putting the parts together is extremely  difficult without clearly visible distortion.  Thus, the client can  view any part of the image in detail, but is unable to obtain a  usable copy of the whole.

Title: A DCT-domain blind watermarking system using optimum detection on  Laplacian model
Abstract: This paper presents a digital watermarking system in the DCT domain.   The watermarking system is designed to satisfy strictly the  perceptual constraints.  Under the constraints, robust and fragile  watermarking techniques are designed by varying the watermark  strength.  The optimum detection structure is constructed based on  the Laplacian model, which has the properties that high performance  can be achieved for a large variety of statistical models, and the  computation is efficient.  The detection does not need the original  images.  It can also detect the tampered regions very accurately.  The simulations validate the watermarking system.  The system can be used in copyright notification and protection, broadcast monitoring and  tracking, and authentication and tamper-proofing.  11 Refs.

Title: New fragile authentication watermark for images
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new fragile watermark for image  authentication.  Based on the Yeung-Mintzer scheme [1 ] , the new watermark does not have certain security  gaps common to many previously proposed fragile watermarks.  A block  cipher is used instead of binary look-up tables.  Pixel values are  perturbed by small quantities so that the cipher maps small pixel  neighborhoods to a fixed binary logo.  This process is further  modified in order to embed image indices (time stamps) into disjoint blocks of every image.  This is necessary for detection of collages  from multiple authenticated images.  We also formulate basic security requirements and investigate the security of the new scheme.  12  Refs.

Title: A blind & readable watermarking technique for color images
Abstract: The paper presents a wavelet domain watermarking technique for color  images.  The characteristics of this transform domain are well suited for masking consideration, due to its good localization in both  space and frequency.  The different color sensitivity can be  exploited in order to increase the watermarking power, and therefore its reliability.  Thanks to the multi-resolution nature of the DWT  the watermark detection can be obtained iteratively.  The technique  has been successfully evaluated against attacks such as JPEG and  JPEG-2000 compression, filtering, cropping, dithering and digital to analog and analog to digital conversions.  7 Refs.

Some results underlining the  improvements we have been able to obtain thanks to our technique are shown.  4 Refs.

Title: Compression tolerant watermarking for image verification
Abstract: Digital Watermarking is seen as a viable solution to authentication  of multimedia data and hence its security, especially in a networked environment.  In this paper we present a new watermarking technique  to add a code to digital images in spatial domain.  This technique is further shown to be robust under common compression schemes,  including lossy compression schemes.  Watermark embedding is done  keeping in mind the limitations of Human Visual System.  We have used a procedure for error diffusion so as to minimize the chances of  image tampering.  For the verification of the image, original  uncorrupted image is not required.  Experimental results show that  the watermark is robust to JPEG compression.  7 Refs.

Title: Copyright protection of still images using self-similar chaotic  watermarks
Abstract: A spatial domain watermarking algorithm for still images is proposed  in this paper.  The watermarks are generated by combining scaled  versions of 2-D chaotic signals, in order to attain a self-similar  structure.  In addition, the 2-D chaotic signal generation procedure  contains operations which ensure that lowpass watermarks are  obtained.  Such characteristics (lowpass spectrum, self-similarity)  enable robustness against compression, lowpass filtering or,  generally, distortions of lowpass nature, as well as, cropping and  scaling.  An additional advantage of the proposed algorithm is that  the detection procedure does not require the original image.  6 Refs.

Title: Robust oblivious digital watermarking using image transform phase  modulation
Abstract: Digital watermarking is the process of secretly embedding a short  sequence of information containing owner identity or copyright  information inside a digital signal, without changing its perceptual quality.  The information is embedded in a way that is difficult to  erase.  We present a new oblivious digital watermarking method for  copyright protection of still images.  The technique is based on  modifying the sign of a subset of low frequency, image transform  coefficients with high to moderate magnitudes.  These transforms  include DCT, DFT and Hadamard transforms.  Watermark detection is  done in an oblivious way.  The robustness to a number of standard  image processing attacks is demonstrated using the criteria of the  latest StirMark benchmark test.  The technique can be used also for  other applications such as image fingerprinting.  11 Refs.

Title: Generalized 2-D cyclic patterns for secret watermark generation
Abstract: This paper describes a new method for generating 2-D watermarks with  good synchronizability and secrecy properties.  The aim of the work  is primarily to develop a watermarking scheme that efficiently and  securely deals with cropping and object segmentation.  It differs  from other existing schemes by its innovative pattern generation  algorithm.  On the basis of a 1-D sequence, we propose an original  method to generate a redundant 2-D pattern with cyclic properties  depending on a secret key.  The cyclic property facilitates the  synchronization for the detection of the watermark when the  reference marks are lost.  Possible applications fields of this  technique are object oriented scene authentication as well as  classical intellectual property rights issues.  7 Refs.

Title: Discovery and application of check constraints in DB2
Abstract: The traditional role of integrity constraints is to protect the  integrity of data.  But integrity constraints can and do play other  roles in databases; for example, they can be used for query  optimization.  In this role, they do not need to model the domain; it is sufficient that they describe regularities that are true about  the data currently stored in a database.  In this paper we describe  two algorithms for finding such regularities (in the syntactic form  of check constraints) and discuss some of their applications in DB2.  In particular, we show their use in query optimization.  24 Refs.

Title: JAC - Access right based encapsulation for Java
Abstract: Unwanted effects of aliasing cause encapsulation problems in  object-oriented programming.  Nevertheless, aliasing is part of  common and efficient programming techniques for expressing sharing  of objects and as such its general restriction is not an option in  practice.  This paper proposes an approach that allows full  referential object sharing but adds transitive access control to  object references to limit the effects of aliasing.  The approach  relies on well-known properties of object-oriented type systems but  exploits them in a novel way to support an access-right-based model  of encapsulation.  It is presented as an extension of Java, called  JAC (Java with Access Control).  Copyright copy 2001 John Wiley &  Sons, Ltd.  35 Refs.

Title: Confined types in Java
Abstract: The sharing and transfer of references in object-oriented languages  is difficult to control.  Without any constraint, practical  experience has shown that even carefully engineered object-oriented  code can be brittle, and subtle security deficiencies can go  unnoticed.  In this paper, we present inexpensive syntactic  constraints that strengthen encapsulation by imposing static  restrictions on the spread of references.  In particular, we  introduce confined types to impose a static scoping discipline on  dynamic references and anonymous methods to loosen confinement  somewhat to allow code reuse.  We have implemented a verifier which  performs a modular analysis of Java programs and provides a static  guarantee that confinement is respected.

This paper proposes a fast  encryption algorithm for multimedia data, called FEA-M.  FEA-M is  based on Boolean matrix theory.  The plaintext and the ciphertext are 64 multiplied by 64 Boolean matrices while the secret key is also a  64 multiplied by 64 matrix.  The structure of FEA-M is chosen to  provide confusion and diffusion and to facilitate both hardware and  software implementation.  15 Refs.

Title: Security methods for MP3 music delivery
Abstract: The impetus for the work presented in this paper arose from the need  to enable Internet-based secure audio delivery and protection of  digitized music against illegal distribution.  Approach described  here, provides protection for widely accepted, MPEG-1 Layer-3 audio  encoding format, although it can easily be applied to any other  Perceptual Audio Coding (PAC) standard.  During the process of MP3  encoding, selective, content-based security features are added to  the stream in order to de-couple and protect individual layers of  audio quality while introducing minimal processing overhead and  maintaining audio format.  In addition to quality-layered protection, we propose simultaneous use of our audio watermarking technology for a complete solution in network-based secure audio delivery and  copyright protection.  8 Refs.

Title: Image based document authentication using DCT
Abstract: This paper is an attempt towards obtaining a method for validation of personal identification documents such as licenses, photo IDs.  The  method tries to obtain a photosignature from the image document by  using certain image processing techniques.  The method uses discrete  cosine transform (DCT) based technique to obtain the required  signature.  This gives a substantially compressed signature which is  quite unique for that particular document.  In case of authentication from a large database the signature can be used as hashing function  for indexing.  Results of experiments done on a large database have  validated the approach. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights  reserved.  11 Refs.

Title: Authenticated ad hoc routing at the link layer for mobile systems
Abstract: We have designed an authenticated link-level ad hoc routing protocol  and integrated it with the Portland State University implementation  of Mobile-IP.  The routing protocol addresses link security issues.   In our protocol, mobile nodes, as well as agents, broadcast ICMP  router discovery packets.  The router discovery packets are  authenticated and bind the sender's MAC and IP addresses.  Problems  caused by tying IP subnet schemes to routing on radio links are  eliminated.  Security problems associated with ARP spoofing are also  reduced.  This link-level protocol is integrated with Mobile-IP on  links where increased security is needed.  The protocol replaces ARP, and may be integrated with higher-level multi-hop ad hoc routing  protocols.  17 Refs.

Title: Designing to support adversarial collaboration
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of adversarial collaboration, through  field studies of a legal firm.  Adversarial collaboration requires  that people with opposing goals (adversaries) come to agreement,  usually producing a shared product that reflects the interests of  the adversarial parties.  Adversarial collaboration is characterized  by secrecy, advocacy and discovery.  To support this activity,  software should provide flexible, selective sharing of awareness and access.  These requirements contrast with conventional shared  resource and awareness systems, which tend to assume cooperative  collaboration, characterized by open processes and static membership lists.  We illustrate these ideas in a redesign of our PeopleFlow  research prototype.  30 Refs.

Title: An approach to safe object sharing
Abstract: It is essential for security to be able to isolate mistrusting  programs from one another, and to protect the host platform from  programs.  Isolation is difficult in object-oriented systems because  objects can easily become aliased.  Aliases that cross program  boundaries can allow programs to exchange information without using  a system provided interface that could control information exchange.  In Java, mistrusting programs are placed in distinct loader spaces  but uncontrolled sharing of system classes can still lead to aliases between programs.  This paper presents the object spaces protection  model for an object-oriented system.  The model decomposes an  application into a set of spaces, and each object is assigned to one space.  All method calls between objects in different spaces are  mediated by a security policy.  An implementation of the model in  Java is presented.  25 Refs.

Title: Adaptive fuzzy logic controller
Abstract: This paper describes background and design of a model free adaptive  Fuzzy Logic Controller.  Controller Error Scaling Factor adaptation  uses principle of balancing Error and Change of Error actions.   Adaptation proceeds only if prescribed set of conditions is  satisfied.  Controller Scaling Factor for Change of Output adaptation uses weighted average of correction from oscillation index and  process steady state gain estimates.  Interaction between Scaling  Factor of Output adaptation and Scaling Factor of Error adaptation  has been alleviated by applying different adaptation speed for the  two parameters and by using corrective calculations.  The distinctive feature of the tuner design is simplicity.  Simulation test results  verify tuning properties for set point changes over a range of  changes of the process dynamics.  12 Refs.

Title: Uncertainty modelling of expert system for condition monitoring of  power transformer
Abstract: One of the most effective, quick and economical method for condition  monitoring of large transformer is by dissolved gas analysis (DGA).   This paper presents the development of an uncertain modelling of  expert system (ES) for condition monitoring of large transformer  using dissolved gas analysis (DGA).  Based on the results of DGA the  software judges the transformer from various angles and arrives at  an overall assessment of its health and the level of severity Of  developing faults.  The problem of uncertain inferences, that may  arise in few cases, has been tackled by fuzzy set theory.  During  development of the ES, type, previous history and the age of the  transformer have been considered.  The software has been implemented  in Turbo C++.  The developed software is versatile and provides  satisfactory results under almost all possible cases.  13 Refs.

Title: Fuzzy logic power system stabilizer
Abstract: This paper deals with the design of fuzzy logic power system  stabilizer (FLPSS) considering speed deviation, Delta omega and  acceleration Delta omega as input signals.  Investigations have been  carried out considering three, five and seven membership functions  of triangular, trapezoidal and Gaussian shapes.  Investigations  clearly show that FLPSS, designed considering a set of three  membership functions, provides system dynamic performance quite  comparable to that obtained with either five or seven membership  functions.  Moreover, FLPSS with trapezoidal membership functions  provides somewhat better performance as compared to that of  triangular or Gaussian membership functions.  The performance of  FLPSS designed considering three membership functions of trapezoidal shape is quite robust over a wide range of loading conditions.  8  Refs.

Title: Fuzzy clustering with a specified membership function for target  detection with a radar system
Abstract: Many common clustering algorithms, such as the fuzzy C-means and the  classical k-means clustering algorithms, proceed without making any  assumptions about the form of the detector that will use the  parameters that they determine.  We compare the performance of a  radial basis function (RBF) network with parameters that are  determined using a modified fuzzy clustering procedure to that of an RBF network with parameters that are determined using a  least-mean-square-error (classical) clustering procedure.  As part of the fuzzy clustering procedure, we assume a particular functional  form for the fuzzy membership function.  We train and test both of  the networks on simulated data and present performance results in  the form of receiver operating characteristic curves.  5 Refs.

Title: Spatiotemporal segmentation of moving video objects over MPEG  compressed domain
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach for unsupervised segmentation  of moving video objects (VOs) over MPEG compressed domain.  The  proposed algorithm utilizes the homogeneity property of the  spatiotemporally localized VO's information-macroblock motion  vectors (MVs) and DCT's DC coefficients, in order to achieve  segmentation with accuracy of 8 multiplied by 8 DCT block size.   First, macroblock MVs are utilized to identify the locations of  moving VOs mainly based on our previous works in [1 ] - [3] .  DC coefficients are  then exploited to achieve finer boundary segmentation.  For achieving both objectives, a maximum entropy fuzzy clustering algorithm is  proposed to classify MVs and DC coefficients into homogeneous  regions, respectively.  Experimental results show that the developed  algorithm has accurately segment VOs with accuracy of 8 multiplied  by 8 DCT block size without any user intervention.  6 Refs.

Title: Relevance feedback for content-based image retrieval using the  Choquet integral
Abstract: Relevance feedback is a technique to learn the user's subjective  perception of similarity between images, and has recently gained  attention in Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR).  Most relevance  feedback methods assume that the individual features that are used  in similarity judgments do not interact with each other.  However,  this assumption severely limits the types of similarity judgments  that can be modeled.  In this paper, we explore a more sophisticated  model for similarity judgments based on fuzzy measures and the  Choquet Integral, and propose a suitable algorithm for relevance  feedback.  Experimental results show that the proposed method is  preferable to traditional weighted-average techniques.  The proposed  algorithm is being incorporated into a CBIR system developed at  Korea Telecom.  13 Refs.

Title: Extending databases to support image editing
Abstract: In order to understand similarity between images, recent research has focused on adaptable searches and fuzzy queries.  However, one of the best means for determining similarity between images is to know how  the image was created.  If the image is a combination of other images in the database, then there is a great deal of similarity between  the base images and the created one.  This requires extending the  database to support image editing operations.  We have built a  preliminary system which does this by using a web-based image editor and a image server.  The editor and the server understand a logical  model language that represents images.  This paper then explores the  issues of performance for deriving images from a sequence of  operations.  12 Refs.

Title: Extended fuzzy rules for image segmentation
Abstract: The generic fuzzy rule-based image segmentation technique (GFRIS)  does not produce good results for non-homogeneous regions that  posses abrupt changes in pixel intensity, because it fails to  consider two important properties of perceptual grouping, namely  surroundedness and connectedness.  In this paper a new technique  called extended fuzzy rules for image segmentation (EFRIS) is  proposed, which includes a second rule to that defined already in  GFRIS, that incorporates both the surroundedness and connectedness  properties of a region's pixels.  This additional rule is based on a  spilt and merge algorithm and refines the output from the GFRIS  technique.  Two different classes of image, namely light intensity  and medical X rays are empirically used to assess the performance of the new technique.  Quantitative evaluation of the performance of  EFRIS is discussed and contrasted with GFRIS using one of the  standard segmentation evaluation methods.  Overall, EFRIS exhibits  significantly improved results compared with the GFRIS approach.  11  Refs.

Title: Fuzzy medical image processing for segmenting the lateral ventricles  from MR images
Abstract: This paper shows an automated method for segmenting the lateral  ventricles from human brain MR images.  It enables us to  automatically volumetry and construct 3-D rendering images.  First of all we segment the whole brain and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by  using a 3-D MR image processing software developed by Hata et al.   Our method for segmenting the lateral ventricles is based on fuzzy  inference techniques, which is able to represent expert's knowledge  and to introduce the knowledge to image processing.  The employed  knowledge on the lateral ventricles is the location, the intensity,  and the shape.  The proposed method was applied to MR volumes of 20  normal volunteers, 20 Alzheimer disease and 20 hydrocephalus  patients.  The experimental results validated that this method was  able to segment the lateral ventricles with high accuracy.  9 Refs.

Title: Segmentation of magnetic resonance images using fuzzy Markov random  fields
Abstract: In this paper, we present a fuzzy Markovian method for brain tissue  segmentation from magnetic resonance images.  Generally, there are  three principal brain tissues in a brain dataset: gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid.  However, due to the limited  resolution of the acquisition system, many voxels may be composed of multiple tissue types (partial volume effects).  The proposed method  aims to calculate the fuzzy membership of each voxel to indicate the partial volume degree using a fuzzy Markovian segmentation.  Since  our method is unsupervised, it first estimates the fuzzy Markovian  Random Field model parameters using a stochastic gradient algorithm.  The efficiency of the proposed method is quantified on a digital  phantom using an absolute average error, and qualitatively tested on real MRI brain data.  12 Refs.

Title: Blind source separation using multinode sparse representation
Abstract: The blind source separation problem is concerned with extraction of  the underlying source signals from a set of their linear mixtures,  where the mixing matrix is unknown.  It was discovered recently, that exploiting the sparsity of sources in their representation according to some signal dictionary, dramatically improves the quality of  separation.  It is especially useful in image processing problems,  wherein signals possess strong spatial sparsity.  In this work we use the multiscale transforms, such as wavelet or wavelet packets, to  decompose signals into sets of local features with various degrees  of sparsity.  We use this intrinsic property for selecting the best  (most sparse) subsets of features for further separation.   Experiments with 1D signals and images demonstrate significant  improvement of separation quality.  7 Refs.

Title: Unsupervised classification using spatial region growing segmentation and fuzzy training.
Abstract: This study has presented an approach to unsupervisedly estimate the  number of classes and the parameters of defining the classes in  order to train the classifier.  Region growing segmentation and local fuzzy classification have been employed to find the sample classes  that well represent the true image.  The segmentation algorithm makes use of spatial contextual information in a hierarchical clustering  procedure and multi-window operating using a pyramid-like structure  to increase computational efficiency.  The fuzzy classification,  which conducts classification by iteratively identifying expected  maximum likelihood parameters of the class, is applied for the  segmented regions in order to determine the sample classes.  The  maximum likelihood classifier has then used the unlabelled regions  to assign them into one of a finite number of classes.  The algorithm has been evaluated with simulated image data with various class  patterns.  6 Refs.

Title: Scale space segmentation of color images using watersheds and fuzzy  region merging
Abstract: A multi-resolution segmentation approach for color images is  proposed.  The scale space is generated using the Perona-Malik  diffusion approach and the watershed algorithm is employed to  produce the regions in each scale.  The dynamics of contours and the  relative entropy of color regions distribution are estimated as  region dissimilarity features across the scale-space stack, and  combined using a fuzzy rule based system.  A minima-linking process  by downward projection is carried out and subsequently the region  dissimilarity, combining color, scale and homogeneity is estimated  for the finer scale (localization scale).  The final segmentation is  derived using a previously presented merging process.  To validate  its performance qualitative and quantitative results are provided.   17 Refs.

Title: Noise estimation in digital images using fuzzy processing
Abstract: The noise estimation is an important issue in image processing  because it is a fundamental step in many algorithms for the noise  suppression and then for the image restoration.  In literature many  approaches have been presented in order to obtain good results.  This paper presents a novel method suitable to get a good estimation if  the type of the noise distribution is known.  In particular the  algorithm provides the variance of noise distribution and the proof  that distribution itself matches the foreseen one.  The algorithm has been tested on different images affected by gaussian noise and the  simulations show results better than those obtained with other  approaches.  8 Refs.

Title: Active contour segmentation guided by AM-FM dominant component  analysis
Abstract: For the first time, we explore the application of active contours in  the modulation domain by computing snakes on image modulations.  As  we demonstrate in the examples, such snakes are able to utilize  information inherent in the dominant image modulations to acquire  and track visually and semantically meaningful structures within the image.  We use nonlinear AM-FM image representations to capture  regions that are homogeneous in intensity and in texture.  A  geometric snake approach utilizing a fuzzy classifier is then  applied to the image modulations.  The combination of AM-FM analysis  and the active contour evolution produces an efficacious image  partition.  As a preliminary demonstration of this novel approach, we apply the modulation domain snakes to the classical texture  segmentation problem.  12 Refs.

Title: A systematic neuro-fuzzy modeling framework with application to  material property prediction
Abstract: A systematic neural-fuzzy modelling framework that includes the  initial fuzzy model self-generation, significant input selection,  partition validation, parameter optimization, and rule-base  simplification is proposed in this paper.  In this framework, the  structure identification and parameter optimization are carried out  automatically and efficiently by the combined use of a  self-organization network, fuzzy clustering, adaptive  back-propagation learning, and similarity analysis-based model  simplification.  The proposed neuro-fuzzy modelling approach has been used for nonlinear system identification and mechanical property  prediction in hot-rolled steels from construct composition and  microstructure data.  Experimental studies demonstrate that the  predicted mechanical properties have a good agreement with the  measured data by using the elicited fuzzy model with a small number  of rules.  31 Refs.

Title: Fuzzy curve-tracing algorithm
Abstract: This paper presents a fuzzy clustering algorithm for the extraction  of a smooth curve from unordered noisy data.  In this method, the  input data are first clustered into different regions using the  fuzzy c-means algorithm and each region is represented by its  cluster center.  Neighboring cluster centers are linked to produce a  graph according to the average class membership values.  Loops in the graph are removed to form a curve according to spatial relations of  the cluster centers.  The input samples are then reclustered using  the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm, with the constraint that the  curve must be smooth.  The method has been tested with both open and  closed curves with good results.  36 Refs.

Title: Fuzzy modeling with multivariate membership functions: Gray-box  identification and control design
Abstract: A novel framework for fuzzy modeling and model-based control design  is described.  The fuzzy model is of the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) type with constant consequents.  It uses multivariate antecedent membership  functions obtained by Delaunay triangulation of their characteristic points.  The number and position of these points are determined by an iterative insertion algorithm.  Constrained optimization is used to  estimate the consequent parameters, where the constraints are based  on control-relevant a priori knowledge about the modeled process.   Finally, methods for control design through linearization and  inversion of this model are developed.  The proposed techniques are  demonstrated by means of two benchmark examples: identification of  the well-known Box-Jenkins gas furnace and inverse model-based  control of a pH process.  The obtained results are compared with  results from the literature.  39 Refs.

Title: Fuzzy rule extraction from ID3-type decision trees for real data
Abstract: This paper proposes a method to construct a fuzzy rule-based  classifier system from an ID3-type decision tree (DT) for real data.  The three major steps are rule extraction, gradient descent tuning  of the rule-base, and performance-based pruning of the rule-base.   Pruning removes all rules which cannot meet a certain level of  performance.  To test our scheme, we have used the DT generated by  RID3, an ID3-type classifier for real data.  In this process, we made some improvements of RID3 to get a tree with less redundancy and  hence a smaller rule-base.  The rule-base is tested on several data  sets and is found to demonstrate an excellent performance.  Results  obtained by the proposed scheme are consistently better than C4.5  across several data sets.  43 Refs.

Title: Fuzzy c-means clustering of incomplete data
Abstract: The problem of clustering a real s-dimensional data set X = left  brace x//1, .  .  .  , x//n right brace is contained in R**s is  considered.  Usually, each observation (or datum) consists of  numerical values for all s features (such as height, length, etc.),  but sometimes data sets can contain vectors that are missing one or  more of the feature values.  For example, a particular datum x//k  might be incomplete, having the form x//k = (254.3, ?, 333.2,  47.44,?)**T, where the second and fifth feature values are missing.   The fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm is a useful tool for clustering  real s-dimensional data, but it is not directly applicable to the  case of incomplete data.  Four strategies for doing FCM clustering of incomplete data sets are given, three of which involve modified  versions of the FCM algorithm.  Numerical convergence properties of  the new algorithms are discussed, and all approaches are tested  using real and artificially generated incomplete data sets.  24 Refs.

Title: Fuzzy multicriterion design using immune network simulation
Abstract: Structural optimization problems have been traditionally formulated  in terms of crisply defined objective and constraint functions.  With a shift in application focus towards more practical problems, there  is a need to incorporate fuzzy or noncrisp information into an  optimization problem statement.  Such practical design problems often deal with the allocation of resources to satisfy multiple, and  frequently conflicting design objectives.  The present paper deals  with a genetic algorithm based optimization procedure for solving  multicriterion design problems where the objective or constraint  functions may not be crispy defined.  The approach uses a genetic  algorithm based simulation of the biological immune system to solve  the multicriterion design problem; fuzzy set theory is adopted to  incorporate imprecisely defined information into the problem  statement.  A notable strength of the proposed approach is its  ability to generate a Pareto-Edgeworth front of compromise solutions in a single execution of the GA.  22 Refs.

Title: Structural optimal design of systems with imprecise properties: A  possibilistic approach
Abstract: The optimization problem of structural systems with imprecise  properties on the basis of a possibilistic approach is considered.   System imprecisions are defined by fuzzy numbers and characterized  by membership functions.  A methodology for the efficient solution of the optimization process is presented.  A two-step method is used to  include the imprecision within the optimization, where high quality  approximations are used for the evaluation of structural responses.   The approximations are constructed using concepts of intermediate  response quantities and intermediate variables.  The approach is  basically an algebraic process which can be implemented very  efficiently for the optimal design of general structural systems  with imprecise parameters.  The method provides more information to  the designer than is available using conventional design tools.  The  effectiveness of the methodology and the interpretation of the  results are illustrated by the solution of two example problems.   copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The detailed procedure of utilizing  an ID3 algorithm for tolerance-related knowledge acquisition is  introduced, including calculating the information gain measure  (entropy) and generating the final decision tree.  The method can be  easily applied to other engineering areas and the result has great  value in practice.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that useful information can be derived from remotely sensed data to extend local environmental measurements over the land surface.  A flexible fuzzy classification approach, in  particular, was demonstrated to be superior to conventional  multivariate regression methods for this purpose.  This new extension methodology is described and discussed in detail.  Next, some  modifications are proposed in order to improve the consideration of  the spectral information and to produce per-pixel estimates of the  error committed.  The performances of the original and modified  methodologies are then evaluated in two case studies representative  of different parameters to extend and satellite data.  The results  show the efficiency of the new strategy and, in particular, some  improvements obtained by the modified method which testify to the  effectiveness of the modifications proposed.  26 Refs.

Title: A fuzzy ARTMAP-based Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship  (QSPR) for predicting physical properties of organic compounds
Abstract: A modified fuzzy ARTMAP neural-network-based QSPR for predicting  normal boiling points, critical temperatures, and critical pressures of organic compounds was developed.  Seven or eight molecular  descriptors (the sum of atomic numbers; five valence connectivity  indices; and the second-order kappa shape index, without or with the dipole moment) were used to describe the topological and electronic  features of a heterogeneous set of 1168 organic compounds.  Optimal  training and testing sets were selected with fuzzy ART.  The fuzzy  ARTMAP models with eight descriptors as input provided the best  predictive and extrapolation capabilities compared to optimal  back-propagation models and group contribution methods.  The absolute mean errors of predictions for the normal boiling point (1168  compounds), the critical temperature (530 compounds), and the  critical pressure (463 compounds) were 2.0 K (0.49%), 1.4 K (0.24%), and 0.02 MPa (0.52%), respectively.  A composite model for  simultaneously estimating the three properties yielded similar  results.  46 Refs.

Abstract: Entropy is generally a measurement of the fuzziness degree for a  fuzzy set.  This paper studies the entropy calculation of the  standard product of two general fuzzy intervals, i.e.  C=A multiplied by B, and then provides some simple formulas to get the entropy of  the product C. Those formulas are composed of the locations of  critical points of the fuzzy intervals A and B. By the formulas, the calculation of the membership function of the product C is not  needed any more, and the fuzziness estimation of the product of two  arbitrary fuzzy intervals can be obtained quickly and effectively.   copy 2001 IMACS.

Title: An improved switched diversity combining using fuzzy adaptive control
Abstract: Diversity combining techniques, due to their extreme effectiveness in counteracting fading effects in wireless environment, have been  extensively studied in recent years.  In this paper, we propose an  improved switched combining scheme using fuzzy adaptive control,  namely, fuzzy adaptive switched diversity (FASD), which is  applicable for implementation at mobile units.  Specifically, the  fuzzy adaptive control dynamically adjusts the threshold level, at  which switching is performed, based on the present varying channel  conditions.  By incorporating the statistics of mobile fading  channels and extensive simulations, we have achieved an effective  system design of FASD which has a significant improvement in system  performance in terms of both the diversity gain and BER (bit error  rate), while maintaining reasonable simplicity in implementation.  11 Refs.

Due to their  different suitable scope and algorithmic complexity, they can be  divided into several groups.  In order to find out the most suitable  algorithm for current fault, the three basic parts of the new  integrated intelligent system, Service Restoration Algorithm Set  (SRAS).  Software Model of Distribution Management System (DMS), and  Service Restoration Fuzzy Expert System (SERFES) are proposed.   Finally, using this system, a fast service restoration is obtained  on a 6-bus network.  15 Refs.

Title: Fuzzy control of subband coded image quality using standard and fuzzy quality measure
Abstract: We propose a method for subband coded image quality supervision using a closed loop fuzzy controller for adjusting the quantization steps.  As a measure of the image quality used in the control loop, we first use the standard quadratic quality measure SNR in decibels.  We then  expand this measure using the compression ratio in a novel quality  measure that is designed on the basis of subjective experiments and  implemented with fuzzy logic.  Our results demonstrate the superior  performance of the proposed fuzzy quality measure over the standard  SNR quality measure in terms of correlation with the subjective  impression of compressed images.

Title: Generating robust parses using island grammars
Abstract: Source model extraction-the automated extraction of information from  system artifacts-is a common phase in reverse engineering tools.  One of the major challenges of this phase is creating extractors that  can deal with irregularities in the artifacts that are typical for  the reverse engineering domain (for example, syntactic errors,  incomplete source code, language dialects and embedded languages).   This paper proposes a solution in the form of island grammars, a  special kind of grammars that combine the detailed specification  possibilities of grammars with the liberal behavior of lexical  approaches.  We show how island grammars can be used to generate  robust parses that combine the accuracy of syntactical analysis with the speed, flexibility and tolerance usually only found in lexical  analysis.  We conclude with a discussion of the development of  MANGROVE, a generator for source model extractors based on island  grammars and describe its application to a number of case studies.   40 Refs.

Title: System performance enhancement in CDMA mobile system with uplink  adaptive power control based on fuzzy logic
Abstract: An uplink adaptive signal-to-interference (SIR) based power control  mechanism for a code division multiple access (CDMA) mobile system  using a fuzzy logic technique was analyzed.  The system performance  in the fuzzy proportion-plus-integral (PI) algorithm was improved at the cost of more bandwidth and capacity on the downlink.  The fuzzy  logic technique was only used as a decision tool to assist the  system to make inferences and to obtain relative precise cmds to  manage the system operation.  The proposed uplink fuzzy PI power  control algorithm enabled better system performance in terms of  outage probability, response time and stability than the power  control algorithms, and was easy to implement.

Title: Compensatory fuzzy neural networks-based intelligent detection of  abnormal neonatal cerebral Doppler ultrasound waveforms
Abstract: Compensatory fuzzy neural networks (CFNN) without normalization,  which can be trained with a backpropagation learning algorithm, is  proposed as a pattern recognition technique for intelligent  detection of Doppler ultrasound wave-forms of abnormal neonatal  cerebral hemodynamics.  Doppler ultrasound signals were recorded from the anterior cerebral arteries of 40 normal full-term babies and 14  mature babies with intracranial pathology.  The features of normal  and abnormal groups as inputs to pattern recognition algorithms were extracted from the maximum velocity waveforms by using principal  component analysis.  The proposed technique is compared with the CFNN with normalization and other pattern recognition techniques applied  to Doppler ultrasound signals from various arteries.  The results  show that the proposed method is superior to the others, and can be  a powerful technique to be used in analyzing Doppler ultrasound  signals from various arteries.  32 Refs.

Title: Classification of noisy signals using fuzzy ARTMAP neural networks
Abstract: This paper describes an approach to classification of noisy signals  using a technique based on the fuzzy ARTMAP neural network (FAMNN).   The proposed method is a modification of the testing phase of the  fuzzy ARTMAP that exhibits superior generalization performance  compared to the generalization performance of the standard fuzzy  ARTMAP in the presence of noise.  An application to textured  grayscale image segmentation is presented.  The superiority of the  proposed modification over the standard fuzzy ARTMAP is established  by a number of experiments using various texture sets, feature  vectors and noise types.  The texture sets include various aerial  photos and also samples obtained from the Brodatz album.   Furthermore, the classification performance of the standard and the  modified fuzzy ARTMAP is compared for different network sizes.   Classification results that illustrate the performance of the  modified algorithm and the FAMNN are presented.  27 Refs.

Title: FROS: A fuzzy logic-based recogniser of olfactory signals
Abstract: In this paper we describe FROS, a fuzzy logic-based recogniser of  olfactory signals.  FROS integrates two recognisers, namely the  shape-based recogniser and the dynamic range-based recogniser.  While the former uses a linguistic description of the shape of the  signals, the latter exploits a fuzzy classification of their dynamic ranges.  FROS was designed to classify signals produced by a sensor  array that comprises conducting polymer sensors with partially  overlapping sensitivities.  The sensors are exposed to odorants and  the resistance values are used for classification.  Results of the  application of FROS to two different test cases are also presented.   copy 2001 Pattern Recognition Society.  Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  29 Refs.

Title: Application of fuzzy logic to vehicle classification algorithm in  loop/piezo-sensor fusion systems
Abstract: Individual vehicle information, especially, vehicle classification  data plays a key role in an advanced traffic management and  information systems (ATMIS).  In inductive loop and piezo-sensor  fusion systems, traffic data such as the vehicle length and the  distance between axles are used for vehicle classification.  However, classification errors often occur in distinguishing passenger cars  from small trucks and in distinguishing medium-sized trucks from  small trucks.  It is mainly attributed to the fact that they are  similar in lengths and have similar inter-axle distances.  To improve the performance in vehicle classification, a new algorithm is  developed using a fuzzy logic.  Vehicle weight and speed are used as  the inputs to the fuzzy logic block.  The output of the fuzzy logic  block is a weighting factor to modify the calculated vehicle length.  Experimental results show that the developed algorithm significantly improves the classification performance.  (Edited abstract) 17 Refs.

Title: Two-grade fuzzy synthetic decision-making system with use of an  analytic hierarchy process for performance evaluation of grinding  fluids
Abstract: A two-grade fuzzy synthetic decision-making system with use of an  analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for evaluating the performance of  grinding fluids is reported.  Five different pairs of algorithms were used in the first evaluation.  Their reliability was ordered  according to the principle of least squires method.  The first three  algorithms were selected and used in the second-grade evaluation.   The factor weight of the first-grade evaluation was calculated by  the AHP for improving the reliability and objectivity of the  evaluation results.  As an example, three types of grinding fluid  were compared and evaluated. copy 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.  All  rights reserved.  9 Refs.

Title: Hierarchical fuzzy logic control of a manipulator with slewing and  deployable links
Abstract: The advantages of combining a conventional controller and a  knowledge-based approach are addressed in the specific context of  regulating a robotic manipulator with deployable and slewing links.   A hierarchical structure having a high-speed crisp-algorithmic  controller at the bottom layer and an intelligent tuner at an upper  layer is developed.  The top-level intelligent tuner uses a valid set of linguistic rules for adjusting proportional-integral servos,  based on the theory of fuzzy logic.  The behavior of the system is  evaluated on the basis of the numerical simulation results as well  as experiments with a prototype manipulator system.  Results suggest  significant improvement in the system performance through the fuzzy  logic-based hierarchical control structure.  18 Refs.

Abstract: Image segmentation is very essential and critical to image processing and pattern recognition.  This survey provides a summary of color  image segmentation techniques available now.  Basically, color  segmentation approaches are based on monochrome segmentation  approaches operating in different color spaces.  Therefore, we first  discuss the major segmentation approaches for segmenting monochrome  images: histogram thresholding, characteristic feature clustering,  edge detection, region-based methods, fuzzy techniques, neural  networks, etc.; then review some major color representation methods  and their advantages/disadvantages; finally summarize the color  image segmentation techniques using different color representations.  The usage of color models for image segmentation is also discussed.

Title: Neural fuzzy analysis of delaminated composites from shearography  imaging
Abstract: The use of shearography for impact damage detection and  characterization is often difficult to achieve in laminated  composites due to lack of a formation of clear fringe patterns as in the case of delaminations.  Furthermore, existing techniques for  interpreting shearograms are often inadequate for impact damage  assessment in composite materials.  In this paper, a technique is  reported that combines conventional image analysis with neural  networks (NNs) classification and fuzzy logic inference to  characterize shearograms.  The objective is to train an automated  system for recognition of pertinent characteristics and features  from shearograms of composites damaged by impact.  The results  demonstrate the potential of the NN-based shearography technique in  characterizing damage in laminated composites.  Its applicability to  structural health monitoring is also discussed. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science Ltd.  All rights reserved.  6 Refs.

Title: Smoothly distributed fuzzy c-means: A new self-organizing map
Abstract: This paper presents a new self-organizing map algorithm.  Unlike the  well-known method of Kohonen, the new algorithm corresponds to the  optimization of an unambiguously defined cost function.  It consists  of a modified version of the widely used fuzzy c-means functional,  where the code vectors are distributed on a regular low-dimensional  grid, and a penalization term is added in order to guarantee a  smooth distribution for the values of the code vectors on the grid.   The mapping properties of the new method, similar to those of  Kohonen's algorithm, are illustrated with several data sets.

Abstract: In this paper we consider the theory of fuzzy logic programming  without negation.  Our results cover logical systems with a wide  variety of connectives ranging from t-norm and conorms, through  conjunctors and disjunctors and their residuals to aggregation  operators.  Rules of our programs are many valued implications.  We  emphasize, that in contrast to other approaches, our logic is truth  functional, i.e. according to P. Hajek, we work in fuzzy logic in  narrow sense.  We prove the soundness and the completeness of our  formal model.  We deal with applications to threshold computation,  abduction, fuzzy unification based on similarity.  We show that fuzzy unification based on similarities has applications to fuzzy  databases and flexible querying. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  29 Refs.

The aim is to develop a theory of natural human  reasoning, whose characteristic feature is the use of natural  language.  Formalism of FLb is based on the theory of fuzzy logic in  narrow sense with evaluated syntax, which provides us means for  modelling of the concepts of intension, possible world and  extension.  Characterization of some of the main properties of the  above expressions is provided.  We also propose a modified definition of the linguistic variable. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

These propositional logics were introduced in Esteva et al.   (Arch.  Math.  Logic, to appear) and they are the combinations of the  Lukasiewicz and the product logic (together with the constant 1/2 in case of the L product 1/2 logic).  The second goal is to show an  axiomatic system and the completeness theorem of a predicate version of the L product and L product 1/2 propositional logics.  It will be  shown that Godel, product and Lukasiewicz predicate logics are  contained in the L product for all logic. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  2 Refs.

Title: A heuristic genetic algorithm for subcontractor selection in a global manufacturing environment
Abstract: In this paper, we present an investigation of how partner selection  problems may be optimized by the use of a precedence network of  subprojects.  At the start, the problem is described by a model with  the subscript-type of variables and nonanalytical objective  function.  It cannot be solved by general mathematical programming  methods.  By using the fuzzy rule quantification method, a fuzzy  logic based decision making approach for the project scheduling is  proposed.  We then develop a fuzzy decision embedded heuristic  genetic algorithm (GA/FD) to find the solution for partner  selection.  The approach was demonstrated by the use of an  experimental example drawn from a coal fire power station  construction project.  The results show us that the suggested  approach is possible to quickly achieve optimal solution for large  size problems.  23 Refs.

Title: A fuzzy theoretic approach for video segmentation using syntactic  features
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the development of a fuzzy-logic-based  framework for segmentation of video sequences.  We have proposed a  scheme for fuzzification of the frame-to-frame property difference  values using the Rayleigh distribution.  The difference values have  been characterized by fuzzy terms like small, significant, large,  etc. These terms have been used to design fuzzy rules for detecting  abrupt changes and gradual changes.  Fuzzy rules have provided a  mechanism for integrating evidences based on different properties.   The decompositional inference strategy has been used for fuzzy  reasoning over the set of fuzzy rules.  Gradual changes have been  further classified as fade-in, fade-out and others (including  dissolves, wipes, etc).  Experimental results have been shown that  the proposed scheme can detect changes reliably. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  16 Refs.

Title: A cooperative fuzzy control method for traffic lights
Abstract: The controlling of traffic signals is an important aspect in morden  traffic system.  In this paper, we present new concepts that called  main urgent phase and minor urgent phase.  The traffic data are  acquired from the detectors in the intersections and lanes.  Based on the concepts of main and minor urgent phase, a set of novel fuzzy  control rules is developed to control the phases and delay of  traffic lights according to the dynamic characters of some  correlative traffic intersections.  The new method can reduce the  average delay time of vehicles effectively.  The method is compared  with Jee-Hyong Lee's method by computer simulation, and the results  prove that our method can improve the performance significantly  especially when the traffic flow is light.  6 Refs.

Title: Incomplete information tables and rough classification
Abstract: The rough set theory, based on the original definition of the  indiscernibility relation, is not useful for analysing incomplete  information tables where some values of attributes are unknown.  In  this paper we distinguish two different semantics for incomplete  information: the "missing value" semantics and the "absent value"  semantics.  The already known approaches, e.g. based on the tolerance relations, deal with the missing value case.  We introduce two  generalisations of the rough sets theory to handle these situations.  The first generalisation introduces the use of a non symmetric  similarity relation in order to formalise the idea of absent value  semantics.  The second proposal is based on the use of valued  tolerance relations.  A logical analysis and the computational  experiments show that for the valued tolerance approach it is  possible to obtain more informative approximations and decision  rules than using the approach based on the simple tolerance  relation.  27 Refs.

Title: Leaving inconsistency using fuzzy logic
Abstract: Current software development methods do not provide adequate means to model inconsistencies and therefore force software engineers to  resolve inconsistencies whenever they are detected.  Certain kinds of inconsistencies, however, are desirable and should be maintained as  long as possible.  For instance, when multiple conflicting solutions  exist for the same problem, each solution should be preserved to  allow further refinements along the development process.  An early  resolution of inconsistencies may result in loss of information and  excessive restriction of the design space.  This paper aims to  enhance the current methods by modeling and controlling the desired  inconsistencies through the application of fuzzy logic-based  techniques.  It is shown that the proposed approach increases the  adaptability and reusability of design models. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  33 Refs.

Title: A fuzzy approach to construction project risk assessment and  analysis: Construction project risk management system
Abstract: The construction industry is plagued by risk, and poor performance  has often been the result.  Although risk management techniques have  been applied, the lack of a formalised approach has produced  inconsistent results.  In this paper, a hierarchical risk breakdown  structure is described to represent a formal model for qualitative  risk assessment.  The relationships between risk factors, risks, and  their consequences are represented on case and effect diagrams.  Risk descriptions and their consequences can be defined using descriptive linguistic variables.  Using fuzzy approximation and composition, the relationships between risk sources and the consequences on project  performance measures can be identified and quantified consistently.   copy 2001 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract: The paper describes a fuzzy decision support system (FDSS) and its  application to the selection of sets of optimal parameters to  characterise the gasket sealing performance in gasketed bolted  flanged joints.  The FDSS of fuzzy logic theory is applied  considering the gas pressure, gasket deflection, and leakage rate  based on required gasket stress and flange surface roughness.  The  idea and implementation of the fuzzy decision support system is  based on the compositional rules of inference and can be applied to  other areas of gasketed bolted flanged joints to automate the  selection of proper parameters which can best characterise the joint sealing performance and provide the required tightness.  15 Refs.

Title: Analysis of process models: A fuzzy logic approach
Abstract: Process modelling tools, such as the Integrated DEFinition (IDEF)  methodology, allow for a systematic and a well-defined  representation of processes, e.g. manufacturing, product  development, and business.  The most frequently recognised  shortcoming of process modelling is the lack of analysis tools.   Owing to the qualitative and static nature of models, mathematical  techniques are difficult to apply.  To make the process modelling  methodologies more attractive, formal techniques for analysis of  process models are required.  In this paper, an analysis approach for process models, based on fuzzy logic and approximate rule-based  reasoning, is presented.  Possibility distributions are used to  represent uncertain and incomplete information of process variables.  An approximate rule based reasoning approach is developed for  quantitative analysis of process models.  The effectiveness of the  approach is illustrated with an industrial example.  The architecture of an expert system for the quantitative analysis of process models  is also outlined.  25 Refs.

Title: A fuzzy-net-based multilevel in-process surface roughness recognition system in milling operations
Abstract: This paper describes a fuzzy-nets approach for a multilevel  in-process surface roughness recognition (FN-M-ISRR) system, the  goal of which is to predict surface roughness (R//a) under multiple  cutting conditions determined by tool material, workpiece material,  tool size, etc. Surface roughness was measured indirectly by  extrapolation from vibration signal and cutting condition data,  which were collected in real-time by an accelerometer sensor.  These  data were analysed and a model was constructed using a neural fuzzy  system.  Experimental results showed that parameters of spindle  speed, feedrate, depth of cut, and vibration variables could predict surface roughness (R//a) under eight different combinations of tool  and workpiece characteristics.  This neural fuzzy system is shown to  predict surface roughness (R//a) with 90% prediction accuracy during a milling operation.  26 Refs.

Title: Fuzzy logic application in gasket selection and sealing performance
Abstract: The paper presents the concept for and the implementation of a fuzzy  logic approach in the selection of gaskets, for their sealing  performance, based on system requirements.  Gasket sealing  performance is complex, owing to numerous parameters affecting the  gasket sealability.  A fuzzy decision support system (FDSS) and its  application to the selection of sets of optimal parameters for the  joint connections are described.  The FDSS is based on the  compositional rules of inference, which take into consideration the  fact that many unknown parameters have an influence on the gasket  sealing performance.  The paper outlines the complex nature of  gaskets, justifying the need for a predictive system capable of  dealing with vague information and providing precise results.  It  also presents a new methodology for proper gasket selection for a  given set of operating conditions, e.g. applied load, gas pressure,  and leakage rate.  23 Refs.

Title: Fuzzy part family formation based on grey relational analysis
Abstract: Part family formation is one of the most important techniques in  computer-aided process planning (CAPP).  This paper presents a new  method that uses grey relational analysis and fuzzy clustering to  form part families.  The main objective of this paper is to identify  part families based on a new similarity coefficient which considers  processing time, lot size, machine usability, etc., by using grey  relational analysis.  After the similarity coefficient is calculated, a fuzzy clustering method is used to obtain part families.  The main  contribution of this paper is to provide a rigorous mathematical  approach to forming part families.  Part family formation can be  controlled, for different applications, by setting a resolution  threshold, so the approach is flexible, practical and reliable.  16  Refs.

Title: Fuzzy logic control for the Ti6A14V laser alloying process
Abstract: It is well known that there are many process parameters which  influence the results of the laser surface alloying process.  Some  parameters should be kept within certain tolerance limits to ensure  the required quality of the surface alloying.  Hence a closed loop  control system is required during the alloying process for quality  control.  This system has multi-inputs and multi-outputs and  nonlinear and time varying dynamic behaviour due to material  properties and dimensional changes.  It is very difficult to develop  an accurate dynamic model for designing a model based control  scheme.  Hence a model-free fuzzy logic control method was employed  in this study.  Two fuzzy controllers were designed to adjust  simultaneously the laser power and the traverse velocity,  respectively, and for handling the absorptivity and geometrical  variations of the work piece.  Simulation results are used to  evaluate the control performance of this control strategy.  11 Refs.

Title: Anytime information processing based on fuzzy and neural network  models
Abstract: In modern measurement and control systems, the available time and  resources are often not only limited, but could change during the  operation of the system.  In these cases, the so called anytime  algorithms could be used advantageously.  While different soft  computing methods are wide-spreadly used in system modeling, their  usability in these cases are limited, because the lack of an  universal method for the determination of the needed complexity  often results in huge and redundant neural networks/fuzzy  rule-bases.  This paper proposes a possible way to carry out anytime  information processing in fuzzy systems or neural networks, with the help of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based complexity  reduction algorithm.  16 Refs.

Title: An approach to fault diagnosis based on a hierarchical information  fusion scheme
Abstract: In this paper, a novel approach, based on a hierarchical information  fusion scheme and using the different symptoms of the faults in the  various locations of a system, to fault diagnosis of the system is  present.  First, the data fusion of various location sensors in a  system is used to guarantee the reliability and accuracy of  measurements.  Then, the different symptoms of the faults in various  locations of a system are classified via multiple neural networks to obtain local decisions.  These local decisions are fused by fuzzy  integral in which the relative importance of each network is also  considered.  Finally, we apply this approach to the model of a  turbine system.  The simulation results verify the effectiveness of  the proposed method.  6 Refs.

Title: An integrated representational model for concurrent assembly design  and planning
Abstract: In this paper, a class of generic P/T nets is first defined by  incorporating knowledge-based system techniques.  Using the knowledge P/T net formalisms, an integrated design object model, defined as a  hierarchy of function-behavior, structure, geometry and feature, is  then proposed based on the design with objects scheme, and used for  a unified representation of assembly modeling, design and planning.   This model is used as a uniform description for both on assembly  level and feature based single part level, and allows designers to  deal with incomplete, imprecise knowledge and uncertainty with the  help of fuzzy logic in assembly oriented design process.  It is also  be used as a graphical language to specify the assembly process for  assembly planning.  Therefore, the developed model is an integrated  representation for concurrent assembly design and planning.  13 Refs.

Title: Fuzzy reasoning Petri Nets for demanufacturing process decision
Abstract: Since products during the use stage may experience very different  conditions, their external and internal status can vary  significantly.  These products, when coming to a demanufacturing  facility, are often associated with incomplete/imprecise, sometime  wrong, information so that the demanufacturing processes have to be  decided dynamically based on the products' specific status.  This  paper presents a Fuzzy Reasoning Petri net model to represent such a product with uncertainty and its related demanufacturing decision  rules.  Based on this model, a formal reasoning algorithm using the  operators in max-algebra is proposed to perform fuzzy reasoning.   Using the proposed model, the multi-criterion demanufacturing rules  can be considered in the parallel way to make the decision  automatically, which makes the real time disassembly process  decision possible.  At last, an example is used to specify the  application of the proposed method.  13 Refs.

Abstract: This paper presents a design methodology of fuzzy system stabilizer  (FPSS) using an adaptive evolution algorithm (AEA).  The AEA consists of genetic algorithm for a global search and evolution strategy for  a local search in an adaptive manner when the present generation  evolves into the next generation.  The AEA is used to optimize the  membership functions and sealing factors of FPSS.  Single machine  infinite system is applied to evaluate the usefulness of the FPSS.   The results show that the proposed FPSS has a better control  performance that the conventional power system stabilizer (CPSS) in  the case of three-phase fault under the heavy load.  To show the  robustness of FPSS, it is applied to the system with disturbances  such as change of mechanical torque and three-phase fault under the  normal and light load.  The results of the FPSS show a better  robustness than that of the CPSS.  12 Refs.

Abstract: A new method of speed control of DC motors using Pulse Width  Modulation (PWM) based Quasi-Resonant (QR) Zero Voltage Switching  (ZVS) DC to DC converters is proposed.  This control minimizes the  switching losses, eliminates Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI),  and improves efficiency and commutation capability of the motor.  The speed control is achieved by controlling the free wheeling period of the resonant inductor of Quasi-Resonant Converter (QRC).  A Half Wave (HW) Constant Frequency (CF) ZVS converter exhibits a non-linear  relationship between its ON time and average output voltage.  Hence,  a fuzzy speed controller is designed to get better performance under load conditions.  The software package PSPICE A/D is used for  simulation.  10 Refs.

Abstract: To overcome the limitations of standard feedforward neural networks,  a new type of higher-order neural networks (i.e. ellipsoidal unit  networks) has been proposed recently, which is very useful for fault diagnosis because of its bounded generalization and extrapolation.   This paper describes the theory and structure of such networks with  respect to two problems arising in training processes, a method for  initializing hyperellipsoids based on the fuzzy cluster algorithm  and a dynamic training strategy.  A case study is given for fault  diagnosis for rotating machine.  The research results show that,  compared with standard feedforward neural networks, the ellipsoidal  unit network is more reasonable and useful for fault diagnosis  applications.

Title: New optimization strategy for chemical mechanical polishing process
Abstract: In this study, a systematic approach to achieve a globally optimal  Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) process is carried out.  In this  new approach, the orthogonal array technique adopted from the  Taguchi method is used to realize an efficiently experimental  design.  The RBFNF neural-fuzzy network is then applied to model the  complex CMP process.  The signal-to-noise ratio (S / N) analysis  (ANOVA) technique used in the conventional Taguchi method is also  implemented to obtain the local optimum process parameters.  The  globally optimal parameters are successively acquired in terms of  the trained RBFNF network.  In order to increase CMP throughput, a  two-stage optimal strategy is also proposed.  Experimental results  demonstrate that the two-stage strategy performs better than the  original approach even though the total processing time is reduced  by 1/6.  13 Refs.

Title: Concrete bridge deterioration diagnosis using fuzzy inference system
Abstract: Bridge management systems (BMSs) are being developed in recent years  to assist various authorities on the decision making in various  stages of bridge maintenance, which requires, first of all,  appropriate preliminary deterioration diagnosis and modeling.  This  paper presents a knowledge-based system for bridge damage diagnosis  that aims to provide bridge designers with valuable information  about the impacts of design factors on bridge deterioration.  The  validity of the influence parameters is verified by the principal  component analysis (PCA).  Fuzzy logic is utilized to handle  uncertainties and imprecision involved, and a modified mountain  clustering method (MMM) is employed for knowledge acquisition.  The  generated rule base is further optimized by the descent method (DM).  Illustrative examples indicate that the techniques of the MMM, the  PCA and the DM are reliable and efficient tools in generating  diagnosis rules and in developing inference systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a new image data fusion scheme based on the  self-organizing feature map (SOFM) neural networks.  The scheme  consists of three steps: (1) pre-processing of the images, where  weighted median filtering removes part of the noise components  corrupting the image, (2) pixel clustering for each image using  two-dimensional self-organizing feature map neural networks, and (3) fusion of the images obtained in Step (2) utilizing fuzzy logic,  which suppresses the residual noise components and thus further  improves the image quality.  It proves that such a three-step  combination offers an impressive effectiveness and performance  improvement, which is confirmed by simulations involving three image sensors (each of which has a different noise structure).

Title: Adaptive order statistics rational hybrid filters for multichannel  image processing
Abstract: A new adaptive multichannel filtering approach is introduced and  analyzed in this paper.  The technique is simpler and more  appropriate than traditional approaches that have been addressed by  means of groupwise vector ordering information.  These filters are a  two-stage filters based on rational functions (RF) using fuzzy  transformations of the Euclidean and angular distances among the  different vectors to adapt to local data in the color image.  The  output is the result of vector rational operation taking into  account three fuzzy sub-function outputs.  Simulation studies  indicate that the filters are computationally attractive and have  excellent performance such as edge and details preservation and  accurate chromaticity estimation.

Title: Tuning of fuzzy logic controller using neural network
Abstract: The transformation of expert's knowledge to control rules in a fuzzy  logic controller has not been formalized and arbitrary choices  concerning, for example, the shape of membership functions have to  be made.  The quality of a fuzzy controller can be drastically  affected by the choice of membership functions.  Thus, methods for  tuning fuzzy logic controllers are needed.  In this paper, neural  networks and fuzzy logic are combined to solve the problem of tuning fuzzy logic controllers.  The neuro-fuzzy controller uses the neural  network learning techniques to tune the membership functions while  keeping the semantics of the fuzzy logic controller intact.  Both the architecture and the tuning algorithm are presented for a general  neuro-fuzzy controller.  From this, a procedure to tune a  proportional fuzzy controller is obtained.  The algorithm for  off-line tuning of the fuzzy controller is demonstrated with a  numerical example.  (Author abstract) 15 Refs.

Title: Identification of influential subsets in regression using a fuzzy  clustering strategy
Abstract: A fuzzy clustering strategy is used to identify subsets of  influential observations in regression.  As part of the fuzzy  clustering strategy, the analyst can explore the uniqueness of  selected subsets and the degree of belonging of observations to  selected subsets.  This is accomplished by either varying a fuzzy  parameter or the number of clusters.  Once the observations or  subsets have been identified, the analyst can then compute  regression diagnostics to confirm their degree of influence in  regression.  Bootstrapping and high-breakdown procedures were used to confirm the influence of the previously identified subsets.  This  fuzzy clustering strategy is applied to the modified data on  wood-specific gravity and an augmented production dataset.  Both  datasets have been previously presented in the literature.

Title: Application of a genetic neuro-fuzzy logic to departure from nucleate boiling protection limit estimation
Abstract: A neuro-fuzzy method is used to estimate the departure from nucleate  boiling (DNB) protection limit using the measured average  temperature and pressure of a reactor core.  The neuro-fuzzy system  parameters are optimized by two learning methods.  A genetic  algorithm is used to optimize the antecedent parameters of the  neuro-fuzzy inference system, and a least-squares algorithm is used  to solve the consequent parameters.  Two neuro-fuzzy inference  systems are used according to the pressure and temperature regions.   The proposed method, which is applied to the Yonggwang 3 and 4  nuclear power plants, has a 6.09% larger thermal margin than the  conventional Westinghouse OTDeltaT DNB protection logic.  This simple algorithm can provide good information for nuclear power plant  operation and diagnosis by estimating the DNB protection limit each  time step.  (Author abstract) 16 Refs.

Title: Multiple forecasting using local approximation
Abstract: In this paper, two local approximation techniques for prediction are  explored.  First, a pattern recognition technique called Pattern  Modelling and Recognition System (PMRS) is explored for making  multiple forecasts.  We then describe a single  nearest-neighbour-based prediction system for multiple forecasting.   Both models are based on using local neighbourhoods in data for  making prediction.  Multiple prediction profiles are generated and  analysed for four-time series data.  These multiple forecasts define  a predicted behavioural profile of given univariate systems.  The  predicted profiles are compared against the actual behaviour of the  studied systems on a number of proposed error measures.  The results  show that local approximation used in the two models for making  multiple forecasts is an important method of profiling the true  behaviour of univariate systems.

Title: Dynamic generation of prototypes with self-organizing feature maps  for classifier design
Abstract: We propose a new scheme for designing a nearest-prototype classifier  using Kohonen's self-organizing feature map (SOFM).  The net starts  with the minimum number of prototypes which is equal to the number  of classes.  Then on the basis of the classification performance, new prototypes are generated dynamically.  The algorithm merges similar  prototypes and deletes less significant prototypes.  If prototypes  are deleted or new prototypes appear then they are fine tuned using  Kohonen's SOFM algorithm with the winner-only update strategy.  This  adaptation continues until the system satisfies a termination  condition.  The classifier has been tested with several well-known  data sets and the results obtained are quite satisfactory.

Title: Decision templates for multiple classifier fusion: an experimental  comparison
Abstract: Multiple classifier fusion may generate more accurate classification  than each of the constituent classifiers.  Fusion is often based on  fixed combination rules like the product and average.  Only under  strict probabilistic conditions can these rules be justified.  We  present here a simple rule for adapting the class combiner to the  application. c decision templates (one per class) are estimated with the same training set that is used for the set of classifiers.  These templates are then matched to the decision profile of new incoming  objects by some similarity measure.  We compare 11 versions of our  model with 14 other techniques for classifier fusion on the Satimage and Phoneme datasets from the database ELENA.  Our results show that  decision templates based on integral type measures of similarity are superior to the other schemes on both data sets.  (Author abstract)  50 Refs.

Title: Color image segmentation based on fuzzy rule-based reasoning applied  to colonoscopic images
Abstract: A fuzzy color segmentation approach is developed for the analysis of  colonoscopic images.  The segmentation is made up of two phases:  segmentation through histogram space filtering and region merging  using fuzzy rule-based reasoning.  The first phase involves using a  scale-space filter to analyze the hue, saturation, and intensity  (HSI) histograms to determine the number of classes and construct a  3-D class grid.  The color image is then segmented based on the class grid.  In the second phase, region merging based on applying the  fuzzy rule-base is employed to guide the combining process of the  segmented regions.  For fuzzy reasoning, three criteria are  evaluated, namely, the edge strength along the boundary, color  similarity, and spatial connectivity of adjoining regions.   Experimental testing of the proposed method applied on colonoscopic  images was conducted, and the results are encouraging.  (Author  abstract) 6 Refs.

Title: Genetic algorithm-aided design of a fuzzy logic stabilizer for a  superconducting generator
Abstract: An important aspect of the design of superconducting generators  concerns stability following a major system disturbance.  Because the superconducting field winding has a very long time constant, turbine governor control is crucial for improving transient and dynamic  stability.  This paper describes the design of a fuzzy logic  stabilizer using a genetic algorithm to enhance the stability of a  superconducting generator whose turbine is equipped with fast acting electro-hydraulic governors.  The stabilizing signal is based on the  instantaneous speed deviation and acceleration of the  superconducting generator and on a set of simple control rules.  A  new approach is proposed to generate the control rules, and thus  increase the effectiveness of the fuzzy logic stabilizer.  A genetic  algorithm is used to search for optimal settings of the fuzzy  stabilizer parameters.  Simulation results, compared with those using a conventional stabilizer, show a significant improvement in the  system performance over a range of operating conditions.  (Author  abstract) 15 Refs.

Title: Fuzzy logic vector control of induction motor
Abstract: This paper proposes the practical implementation of a fuzzy logic  control scheme applied to a two phase (d-q) current model of an  induction motor.  Most conventional fuzzy controller uses fuzzy logic to tune a PI or PID.  The fuzzy logic control scheme does not depend  on the conventional PI or PID model.  It directly transforms the  inputs, speed errors and rate of change in speed errors, into the  output quantity, the change in inverter command frequency.  The  proposed approach is simpler in implementation and its trajectory  tracking capability was investigated.  The experimental results show  that it has a superior performance compared to a fuzzy tuned PI  controller or a simple PID controller.  (Author abstract) 7 Refs.

Title: Defuzzication using polynomial approximation
Abstract: A new fuzzy inference based on piece-wise polynomial interpolation  similar to spline technique is proposed.  The signed membership  function which can encode more information than the usual membership function is also introduced and used together with this new  inference method.  The fuzzy system using this inference method is  more compact compared to other types of fuzzy systems.  On-line  recursive training algorithm is also proposed to tune these  polynomials if numerical training data is available.  In contrast to  neural network where the trained network is only a function of  training data, here, both the heuristic prior knowledge and  available training data are used.  A simulation example is given to  show how this new fuzzy inference can be applied in model reference  closed-loop control system.  (Author abstract) 3 Refs.

A fuzzy inference system is formed using four Web server performance  metric and server utilization index are derived to determine the  servers' utilization states for every time period(s).  A fuzzy Markov model is proposed to illustrate the state transitions of server  resource utilization based on experts' linguistically evaluation of  stationary transition probability.

The entropy weight proposed by  Don-Lin Mon is implemented to evaluate the upgrading alternatives  priority in a Web server system.  Fuzzy numbers act as a reference to indicate the influence strength of each element in the hierarchy  structure. alpha-cut-based method is utilized to prevent the  controversial of fuzzy number ranking process where the fuzzy  judgement matrix is reconstructed into an interval fuzzy judgement  matrix.  Fuzzy linguistic term approach is applied to capture the  fuzziness and subjectiveness of Web administrators' judgements.   (Author abstract) 13 Refs.

Title: Fault diagnosis in air-conditioning systems: A multi-step fuzzy  model-based approach
Abstract: The problem of diagnosing faults in air-conditioning systems is of  increasing importance.  A brief review of heating, ventilating and  air-conditioning (HVAC) fault diagnosis schemes is given, the key  design issues are identified and the advantages of the fuzzy  model-based approach are summarised.  The way in which the fuzzy  fault diagnosis scheme is able to take account of modelling errors,  ambiguous data and sensor bias is explained.  A multi-step approach  to the fuzzy model-based approach is proposed that makes the results of the diagnosis less ambiguous.  A computer simulation study is used to demonstrate that a more precise diagnosis can be obtained using  the new scheme.  Experimental results are also presented that show  that the proposed scheme does not generate false alarms, when it is  used to commission an air-handling unit in a commercial office  building.  1 Refs.

Abstract: A method is presented for obtaining a fuzzy model for the complex  MIMO (multi-input and multi-output) process using experiment data.   The discourse domain of each input variable is divided equally to  determine the premise parameters and the total number of fuzzy  rules.  The consequent parameters of the fuzzy rules are then  obtained by a learning algorithm.  The theoretical analysis shows  that the learning algorithm can converge to any arbitrary need and  the characteristics of the fuzzy rules model which can approximate  the experiment data with accuracy.  The effectiveness of the fuzzy  modeling method and the generalization ability of the fuzzy rules  model are also demonstrated by a simulation example.  3 Refs.

Title: Self-organizing network with fuzzy hyperellipsoidal classifying and  its application in unconstrained handwritten numeral recognition
Abstract: A self-organizing network with the fuzzy hyperellipsoidal-classifying (FHECF) algorithm was proposed to recognize handwritten numerals.   The SOM clustering and the adaptive principle extraction (APEX)  algorithm were used to reproduce the original learning result, with  some small nodes including their coordinates and covariance  matrices, to represent the main distributions of the training set.   Then, the nodes that gave worse performances were split by fuzzy  hyperellipsoidal clustering (FHEC) algorithm and the new nodes were  modified to gain a better learning result.  The results shows that  the algorithm identifies the suitable number of network nodes and  the hyperellipsoidal classifying result to provide a more precise  training requirement.  With the help of supervised learning  algorithms such as learning vector quantization (LVQ), the network  gains a better performance.  In experiments recognizing unconstrained handwritten numerals, the algorithm has also shown satisfying  performance.  10 Refs.

Title: New channel estimation method based on fuzzy system
Abstract: Channel estimation is one of the most important parts in digital  mobile communications.  S. Abeta et al proposed the weighted  multi-slot averaging (WMSA) channel estimation method to improve  transmission performance.  Many studies have shown that fuzzy systems are very useful for function approximation problems.  Therefore a new channel estimation method based on fuzzy systems has been suggested  to further improve the tracking performance against fast fading.  The fuzzy modeling technique is utilized to estimate the data channel  and the least mean square (LMS) algorithm is applied to adaptively  estimate the parameters.  Since fuzzy systems are very useful for  function approximation, our method is superior to the WMSA channel  estimation method in BER performance for variant velocities.  5 Refs.

Title: Application of the fuzzy-stochastic methodology to appraising the  firm value as a European call option
Abstract: The valuing of a firm equity as a call option is a crucial problem in financial decision-making.  There are two basic aspects that are  studied; contingent claim features (payoff functions) and risk  (stochastic process of underlying assets).  However, non-preciseness  (vagueness, uncertainty) of input data is often neglected.  Thus, a  combination of risk (stochastic) and uncertainty (fuzzy instruments) could be a useful approach in calculating a firm value as a call  option.  The Black-Scholes methodology of appraising equity as a  European call option is applied.  Fuzzy-stochastic methodology under  fuzzy numbers (T-numbers) is proposed and described.   Fuzzy-stochastic model of appraising a firm equity is proposed.   Input data are in a form of fuzzy numbers and result, firm  possibility-expected equity value is also determined vaguely as a  fuzzy set.  Illustrative example is introduced. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  23 Refs.

It can obtain the whole system functions:  WTA/MAX/k-WTA/Sorter without adding any extra components.  The  proposed hardware architecture features layout regularity and  interconnection compactness, thus it can be exploited to obtain a  small and efficient hardware implementation.  The chip was fabricated with the TSMC 0.35 square open m SPQM CMOS process.  Experimental  results indicate this chip can work up to 66MHz with the power  consumption less than 10mW at 3.3V supply voltage.  This design is  suitable for VLSI implementation.

Title: A generic fuzzy rule based technique for image segmentation
Abstract: Many fuzzy clustering based techniques do not incorporate spatial  relationships of the pixels, while all fuzzy rule-based image  segmentation techniques tend to be very much application dependent.   In most techniques, the structure of the membership functions are  predefined and their parameters are either automatically or manually determined.  This paper addresses the aforementioned problems by  introducing a general fuzzy rule based image segmentation technique, which is application independent and can also incorporate the  spatial relationships of the pixels.  It also proposes the automatic  defining of the structure of the membership functions.  A qualitative comparison is made between the segmentation results using this  method and the popular fuzzy c-means (FCM) applied to two types of  images: light intensity (LI) and X-ray of human vocal tract.  The  results clear show that this method exhibits significant  improvements over FCM for both types of images.  14 Refs.

Title: A new optimization procedure for extracting the point-based lip  contour using active shape model
Abstract: This paper presents a new optimization procedure for extracting the  point-based lip contour using Active Shape Model (ASM).  A 14-point  ASM lip model is used to describe the lip contour.  With the aid of  fuzzy clustering analysis, a probability map of the color lip image  is obtained and a region-based cost function is established.  The new optimization procedure operates on the spatial domain (actual  contour points) and all the points are pulled towards their  desirable locations in each iteration.  Hence, the lip contour  evolution becomes better controlled and consequently fast  convergence is achieved.  The new procedure can also achieve  real-time performance on lip contour extraction and tracking from  lip image sequence.  9 Refs.

Title: Achieving affordability through fuzzy reasoning and control
Abstract: One way to make a system more affordable is to reduce the number of  redundant components.  Reducing components while still maintaining a  desired level of reliability requires that the functionality of the  eliminated, redundant hardware be replaced with a lower-cost option.  In this paper, we present a methodology that offers such an option  on an aeropropulsion engine.  This option is a low-cost secondary  control unit with an intelligent logic that can be implemented as a  part of the engine health monitoring unit.  The low-cost, secondary  control unit acts like a back-up control, when the primary control  unit becomes faulty.  The back-up unit relies on the models and logic stored in the monitoring unit to provide a reduced-envelope  capability for the flight vehicle.  The basis for the logic is fuzzy  reasoning.  The reasoning is initiated by observing the behavior of  the engine before a fault is developed.  6 Refs.

Abstract: We present here results pertaining to the online adaptation mechanism of a class of linear controllers using tools of soft computing.   These are implemented through the readily available linguistic  knowledge acquired a priori about the system and its behavior along  with the learning achieved in an online and off-line stages of the  control design.  This is applied to a benchmark experimental model  taken here as a DC motor subject to wide range of varying load  parameters and external disturbances.  The results obtained using an  integrated scheme of the optimized Takagi Sugeno scheme are compared with those of a dynamical neural network based scheme.  It is shown  that significant improvements could be made over the conventional  static PID-controller, in particular for load disturbance recovery.   19 Refs.

Title: A new fuzzy logic learning control approach for repetitive trajectory tracking problems
Abstract: In this paper, we consider repeatable tracking control tasks using a  new control approach - PD type Fuzzy Logic Learning Control (FLLC).   FLLC integrates two main control strategies: Fuzzy Logic Control as  the basic control part and Learning Control as the refinement part.   The new FLLC is constructed by simply adding an iterative learning  mechanism to a fuzzy PD controller.  The incorporation of the  learning function into fuzzy PD controllers ensures exact tracking  because it completely nullifies the effects of reference signal and  periodic disturbances on the tracking error.  Through rigorous proof  based on energy function and functional analysis, we show that the  proposed FLLC system achieves the following novel properties: (1)  the tracking error sequence converges uniformly to zero; (2)  learning control sequence converges to the desired control profile  almost everywhere.  7 Refs.

Abstract: In order to improve control performance in both dynamic transient and steady-state periods, this paper presents an enhanced hybrid FUZZY  P+ID controller that is constructed by using an incremental fuzzy  logic controller with twenty-five rules in place of the proportional term in a conventional PID controller.  The enhanced FUZZY P+ID  controller has only two additional parameters to be tuned based on  its PID counterpart.  The analysis shows that the stability behavior  of a control system remains unchanged after replacing the PID  controller by the FUZZY P+ID controller.  Numerical simulation  results of a nonlinear system for both step and tracking control  demonstrate the superior control performance of the FUZZY P+ID  controller.  25 Refs.

Abstract: In this paper, an application for monitoring and control of machine  health using vibration sensing is developed.  This vibration analyzer is able to continuously monitor and compare the actual vibration  pattern against a vibration signature, based on a fuzzy fusion  technique.  More importantly, this intelligent knowledge-based  real-time analyzer is able to detect excessive vibration conditions  much sooner than a resulting fault could be detected by an operator.  Subsequently, appropriate actions can be taken, say to provide a  warning or automatic corrective action.  This approach may be  implemented independently of the control system and as such can be  applied to existing equipment without modification of the normal  mode of operation.  Simulation and experimental results are provided  to illustrate the advantages of the approach taken in this  application.  12 Refs.

Abstract: In the control of flexible manipulators, most work in the literature  concentrates on the suppresion of link deformations.  In this study,  the aim is not to suppress the deflections, but to calculate joint  angles to minimize the tip position error.  A gradient descent method is utilized off-line for the trajectory planning of a two-link  flexible manipulator under gravity.  Fuzzy logic control with gravity compensation is applied for the position control of the manipulator  where the reference inputs are the values of the joint angles as  determined by the trajectory planning procedure.  Simulations have  been carried out to show the performance of both the trajectory  planning method and of the fuzzy controller in a regulation problem.  Results are illustrated both in the joint space and in the  operational space.  8 Refs.

However, the component of work that needs to be done by animators and artists in producing these  synthetic character performances is quite significant.  In this  paper, we prevent an expert system based on fuzzy knowledge bases  that helps in moving towards automating the task of animating  virtual human heads and faces.  Our Virtual Actor (Vactor) framework  is based on several subsystems that use mainly fuzzy and some  non-fuzzy rules to teach virtual actors to know the emotions and  gestures to use in different situations.  Theories of emotion,  personality, dialogue, and acting, as well as empirical evidence are incorporated into our framework and knowledge bases to produce  convincing results.  20 Refs.

Title: Channel-optimized soft trellis waveform coding
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a new fuzzy relaxation trellis code-book  search algorithm over noisy channels.  The new algorithm solves the  problems associated with the LBG algorithm, in the sense of  delivering relatively lower distortion configurations using short  training sequences.  Furthermore, the new approach is significantly  less sensitive to the initialization process.  The algorithm  minimizes a weighted distortion measure averaged over both the  source and the channel statistics.  The weights are soft  distortion-related reliability information, which are delivered by a soft trellis vector quantization algorithm (STVQ).  The concept of  soft compression is introduced in using the forward-backward  symbol-MAP algorithm.  The work introduced in this paper is an  extension to the work established for the noiseless channel case in  [2] .  Testing is performed using a first  order Gauss-Markov source over several trellis structures.  9 Refs.

Title: Fuzzy service scheduling scheme in ATM networks
Abstract: A service scheduling scheme is to control the order of servicing  cells within an ATM node and maintain their Quality of Service  (QoS).  Recent researchers have focused on the efficient ways of  isolation among different incoming traffic, or the different  approach to improve the overall QoS.  However, they seldom try to  achieve both objectives simultaneously.  In this paper, we propose a  new service scheduling scheme with fuzzy logic design to achieve  these two goals.  We use a fuzzy controller to choose an appropriate  service scheduling scheme from the two traditional methods for the  current input traffic environment.  Numerical results show that this  approach not only can achieve both objectives, but also show better  performance as compared with traditional methods.  8 Refs.

Abstract: The goal of seamless communication is to provide disruption free  service to a mobile user.  A disruption in mobile service could occur due to active handoffs.  There are not many user applications that  require either total guarantee for disruption free service or  tolerance for very frequent disruptions.  In this paper, a fuzzy  multicast method that provides a linguistic guarantee for disruption free service is proposed.  The performance of our scheme is evaluated through a simulation with various mobile directions and mobile  velocities, and we know that the fuzzy multicast method  significantly reduces the static network bandwidth usage and also  provides linguistic guarantee for disruption free service.  11 Refs.

Title: Intelligent control of non-linear dynamical systems with a  neuro-fuzzy-genetic approach
Abstract: We describe in this paper, different hybrid intelligent approaches  for controlling non-linear dynamical systems in manufacturing  applications.  The hybrid approaches combine soft computing  techniques and mathematical models to achieve the goal of  controlling the manufacturing process to follow a desired production plan.  We have developed several hybrid architectures that combine  fuzzy logic, neural networks, and genetic algorithms, to compare the performance of each of these combinations and decide on the best one for our purpose.  We consider the case of controlling non-linear  electrochemical processes to test our hybrid approach for control.   Electrochemical processes, like the ones used in battery formation,  are very complex and for this reason very difficult to control.  We  have achieved very good results using fuzzy logic for control,  neural networks for modelling the process, and genetic algorithms  for tuning the hybrid intelligent system.  21 Refs.

Title: New geometrical concepts in Fuzzy-ART and Fuzzy-ARTMAP: Category  regions
Abstract: We introduce new geometric concepts regarding categories in Fuzzy ART (FA) and Fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM), which add a geometric facet to the  process of node selection in the F//2 layer by patterns.  Apart from  providing the means to better understand the training and  performance phase of these two architectures, the new concepts,  namely the category regions, lead us to interesting theoretical  results, when training either architecture.  First, we define the  Commitment Test as a novelty detection mechanism similar to the  Vigilance Test.  Next we define various category regions.  Via those  definitions and 3 derived lemmas we identify areas in the  vigilance-choice parameter space, for which 4 results are stated  that are applicable to both FA and the FAM classifier training  phase.  6 Refs.

Title: Automated classification of Pap smear tests using neural networks
Abstract: The preliminary results of a project that automates the  classification of Pap smear samples are given.  In the preprocessing  stage, first a set of ten features is extracted from a Pap smear  image and is used to form the feature space.  Then, the standard "The Bethesda System" (TBS) rules are translated into fuzzy rules that  are used to classify the Pap smear test into "normal" or "abnormal  classes based on the extracted features.  A feedforward neural  network is applied for the sample for which fuzzy logic based  classification is unclear.  The high accuracy of classification of  neural network on the preliminary results indicates the successful  performance of the system.  10 Refs.

Title: A relationship between binary morphological autoassociative memories  and fuzzy set theory
Abstract: Morphological neural networks (MNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks whose operations are derived from mathematical morphology.   In a morphological neural net, the usual sum of weighted inputs is  replaced by a maximum or minimum of weighted inputs (in this  context, the weighting is performed by summing the weight and the  input).  We speak of a max product, a min product respectively.  In  recent years, a number of different MNN models and applications  emerged [9, 10, 16] .  The emphasis of this  paper is on morphological associative memories (MAMs) [ 12] , in particular on binary autoassociative  morphological memories (AMMs) [14] .  We  give a new set theoretic interpretation of recording and recall in  binary AMMs and provide a generalization using fuzzy set theory.  17  Refs.

Title: Adaptable fuzzy C-means for improved classification as a  preprocessing procedure of brain parcellation
Abstract: Parcellation, one of several brain analysis methods, is a procedure  popular for subdividing the regions identified by segmentation into  smaller topographically defined units.  The fuzzy clustering  algorithm is mainly used to preprocess parcellation into several  segmentation methods, because it is very appropriate for the  characteristics of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), such as partial volume effect and intensity inhomogeneity.  However, some gray  matter, such as basal ganglia and thalamus, may be misclassified  into the white matter class using the conventional fuzzy C-Means  (FCM) algorithm.  Parcellation has been nearly achieved through  manual drawing, but it is a tedious and time-consuming process.  We  propose improved classification using successive fuzzy clustering  and implementing the parcellation module with the modified graphic  user interface (GUI) for the convenience of users.  5 Refs.

Title: Keeping passenger surveys up to date: A fuzzy approach
Abstract: The knowledge of travel demand is an essential prerequisite for  analyzing and planning transport supply.  Obtaining travel-demand  data for a transit system requires passenger survey that combine  counts and interviews.  Passenger surveys have two unpleasant  characteristics: they are expensive, and the results of such studies tend to lose their validity fairly rapidly.  For these reasons, the  development of techniques that reduce survey costs and keep demand  matrices up to date is gaining increasing interest.  Details of a  technique for computer-aided processing of passenger surveys are  given, and a method for continuous updating of demand matrices is  presented.  Because traffic surveys represent only a snapshot  situation, the proposed updating method employs a fuzzy approach to  consider that traffic volumes vary within a certain bandwidth.  6  Refs.

Title: Heuristic models of fuzzy time series for forecasting
Abstract: Song and Chissom first proposed the definitions of fuzzy time series  and time-invariant and variant models of fuzzy time series.  Chen  then proposed arithmetic operations to replace the complex  computations in Song and Chissom's models.  This study proposes  heuristic models by integrating problem-specific heuristic knowledge with Chen's model to improve forecasting.  This is because Chen's  model was easy to calculate, was straightforward to integrate  heuristic knowledge, and forecast better than the others.  Both  university enrollment and futures index are chosen as the  forecasting targets.  The empirical analyses show that the heuristic  models reflect the fluctuations in fuzzy time series better and  provide better overall forecasting results than the previous models. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title: A new approach to fuzzy rule generation: Fuzzy extension matrix
Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to fuzzy rule generation from a  set of examples with fuzzy representation.  The new approach called  fuzzy extension matrix incorporates the fuzzy entropy to search for  paths and generalizes the concept of crisp extension matrix.  By  discussing paths of the fuzzy extension matrix, a new heuristic  algorithm for generating fuzzy rules is introduced.  Compared with  the crisp extension matrix, the proposed method has the capability  of handling fuzzy representation and tolerating noisy data or  missing data.  A case study shows that the proposed heuristic  algorithm partially inherits the advantages from the crisp case such as simplicity of rules and high learning accuracy.  The proposed  approach offers a new, practical way to automatically acquire  imprecise knowledge. copy 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.  All rights  reserved.  24 Refs.

Title: Neuro-fuzzy recognition system for detecting wave patterns using  wavelet coefficients
Abstract: Recognition of specified wave patterns in one-dimensional signals is  an important task in many application areas such as computer  science, medical science, and geophysics.  Many researchers have  tried to automate this task with various techniques, recently the  soft computing algorithms.  This paper proposes a new neuro-fuzzy  recognition system for detecting one-dimensional wave patterns using wavelet coefficients as features of the signals and evolution  strategy as the training algorithm of the system.  The neuro-fuzzy  recognition system first trains the wavelet coefficients of the  training wave patterns and then evaluates the degree of matching  between test wave patterns and the training wave patterns.  This  system was applied to picking first arrival events in seismic data.   Experimental results with three seismic data showed that the system  was very successful in terms of learning speed and performances.  16  Refs.

Title: A new transformed input-domain ANFIS for highly nonlinear system  modeling and prediction
Abstract: In two- or more-dimensional systems where the components of the  sample data are strongly correlated, it is not proper to divide the  input space into several subspaces without considering the  correlation.  In this paper, we propose the usage of the method of  principal component in order to uncorrelate and remove any  redundancy from the input space of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy  inference system (ANFIS).  This leads to an effective partition of  the input space to the fuzzy model and significantly reduces the  modeling error.  A computer simulation for two frequently used  benchmark problems shows that ANFIS with the uncorrelation process  performs better than the original ANFIS under the same conditions.   19 Refs.

Title: A decomposition of fuzzy relations
Abstract: This study is concerned with a decomposition of fuzzy relations, that is their representation with the aid of a certain number of fuzzy  sets.  We say that some fuzzy sets decompose an original fuzzy  relation if the sum of their Cartesian products approximate the  given fuzzy relation.  The theoretical underpinnings of the problem  are presented along with some linkages with Boolean matrices (such  as a Schein rank).  Subsequently, we reformulate the decomposition of fuzzy relations as a problem of numeric optimizing and propose a  detailed learning scheme to a collection of decomposing fuzzy sets.   The role of the decomposition in a general class of data compression problems (including those of image compression and rule-based system condensation) is formulated and discussed in detail.  16 Refs.

Title: Dynamic image sequence analysis using fuzzy measures
Abstract: In this paper, we present an image understanding system using fuzzy  sets and fuzzy measures.  This system is based on a symbolic  object-oriented image interpretation system.  We apply a simple,  powerful three-dimensional (3-D) recursive filter to tracking moving objects in a dynamic image sequence.  This filter has a time-varying  3-D frequency-planar passband that is adapted in a feedback system  to automatically track moving object.  However, as objects in the  image sequence are not well-defined and are engaged in dynamic  activities, their shapes and trajectories in most cases can be  described only vaguely.  In order to handle these uncertainties, we  use fuzzy measures to capture subtle variations and manage the  uncertainties involved.  This enables us to develop an image  understanding system that produces a very natural output.  We  demonstrate the effectiveness of our system with complex real  traffic scenes.  37 Refs.

Title: An optimal fuzzy PID controller
Abstract: This paper introduces an optimal fuzzy  proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller.  The fuzzy PID  controller is a discrete-time version of the conventional PID  controller, which preserves the same linear structure of the  proportional, integral, and derivative parts but has constant  coefficient yet self-tuned control gains.  Fuzzy logic is employed  only for the design; the resulting controller does not need to  execute any fuzzy rule base, and is actually a conventional PID  controller with analytic formulas.  The main improvement is in  endowing the classical controller with a certain adaptive control  capability.  The constant PID control gains are optimized by using  the multiobjective generic algorithm (MOGA), thereby yielding an  optimal fuzzy PID controller.  Computer simulations are shown to  demonstrate its improvement over the fuzzy PID controller without  MOGA optimization.  24 Refs.

Title: A closed-form forward kinematics solution for the 6-6**P Stewart  platform
Abstract: This paper studies the forward kinematics of a special 6-6 Stewart  platform, in which both the base and the mobile platforms are  similar hexagons.  A concise closed-form solution to the forward  kinematics of the Stewart platform is obtained by introducing a  quaternion to represent the transformation matrix.  It is very  interesting to find that the eight possible solutions have a very  simple inner symmetry relationship.  So, the solutions obtained from  the approach presented in this paper are concise, represented as the squares of the four quaternion components.  Besides, unnecessary  complex roots are avoided automatically.  Finally, only univariate  quadratic equations are required to solve in this approach.  7 Refs.

Abstract: In this paper, the problem concerning how to coordinate the  contributions from concurrent controllers, when controlling mobile  robots, is investigated.  It is shown how a behavior based control  system for autonomous robots can be modeled as a hybrid automaton,  where each node corresponds to a distinct robot behavior.  This type  of construction gives rise to chattering executions, but it is shown how regularized automata can be used to solve this problem.  As an  illustration, the obstacle-negotiation problem is solved by using a  combination of a robust path-following behavior and a reactive  obstacle-avoidance behavior that move the robot around a given  obstacle at a predefined safety distance. copy 2001 Published by  Elsevier Science Ltd.  15 Refs.

Abstract: A novel ultrasonic spherical motor is presented in this paper.  With  only a single moving part (rotor), the spherical motor is capable of providing two-DOF (degree-of-freedom) motions required for  micro-satellite and space robot actuation.  The operating principle  of the motor is elaborated and an initial prototype was fabricated  and tested.  The elliptical trajectories of the rotor tip were  demonstrated by making use of two MTI Fotonic 2000 displacement  probes.  The feasibility of the operating principle was verified  using a normal ball bearing held on to the top of the rotor, and a  fast spinning of the ball-bearing occurs at resonance frequencies of 10.67, 18.9 and 28.9 kHz, respectively.  Finally, further improvement issues of the motor are briefly discussed. copy 2001 Elsevier  Science B.V.  All rights reserved.  5 Refs.

Title: Curvature optical fiber whiskers for mobile robot guidance
Abstract: A novel optical fiber tactile sensory system is proposed for obstacle avoidance of mobile robot.  The principle of this whisker-like  tactile sensor is based on the geometric curvature changes of the  optical fiber, which modulate the optical fiber's light output.  With high compliance of plastic optical fiber, the whiskers can produce  only small flexing force upon mechanical contact with an obstacle.   It can produce reliable proximity signals in extended tactile range, which can be translated into a larger stopping distance for the  mobile robot.  This sensor is lightweight, and of low cost to allow  as many sensor, as necessary to be mounted on a robot.  7 Refs.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a new approach for 3D scene reconstruction  based on projective geometry without camera calibration.  Previous  works use at least six points to build two projective reference  planes.  Our contribution is to reduce the number of reference points to four by exploiting some geometrical shapes contained in the  scene.  The first implemented algorithm allows the reconstruction of  a fourth point on each reference plane.  The second algorithm is  devoted to the 3D reconstruction.  We obtained the expected good  results and the proposed method is to equip a mobile robot moving in a structured environment. copy 2001 Pattern Recognition Society.

Title: Adaptive control of an autonomous underwater vehicle: Experimental  results on ODIN
Abstract: This paper presents a six-degrees-of-freedom controller for  autonomous underwater vehicles.  The control algorithm is adaptive in the dynamic parameters that are poorly known and time-varying in the underwater environment.  Moreover, the proposed control law adopts  quaternions to represent attitude errors, and thus avoids  representation singularities that occur when using instead Euler  angles description of the orientation.  The adaptive controller has  been successfully implemented and experimentally validated on  omni-directional intelligent navigator (ODIN), an autonomous  underwater vehicle that has been designed and built at the  University of Hawaii.  The experimental results demonstrate the good  performance of the proposed controller within the constraints of the sensory system.  28 Refs.

Title: Locomotive gait generation for inchworm-like robots using finite  state approach
Abstract: The gait of a multi-segment inchworm robot is a series of actuator  actions that will change the shape of the robot to generate a net  motion.  In this paper, we model the multi-segment inchworm robot as  a finite state automaton.  Gait generation is posed as a search  problem on the graph described by the automaton with prescribed  state transitions.  The state transitions are defined based on the  kinematics of robot locomotion.  The auxiliary actuator concept is  introduced.  Single-stride and multi-stride gait generations are  discussed.  Single-stride gaits exhibit fault-tolerant and real-time  computation features that are necessary in actual applications.  Both computer simulation and experimental hardware platform are developed for various aspects of gait generation and planning.  12 Refs.

Title: Posture design of joint-wheeled mobile robot autonomous negotiating  singular terrain
Abstract: This paper studied the design of initial and obstacle negotiating  posture of joint-wheeled mobile robot autonomous negotiating  singular terrain.  The reflective control strategy is an efficient  method in the plan autonomous motion on terrain with singular  variation and uncertainty parameters.  The key of the reflective  control is efficient real-time environment sensing and real-time  efficient response to the information from sensors, while the key to the real-time sense and response is sensing emergent terrain and  responding efficiently.  The rational designing of initial posture of the joint-wheeled mobile robot makes it having the ability to sense  the singular variation of the local terrain, i.e. it has the ability to sense the terrain that the four-wheeled does not subsume.  The  correct obstacles negotiating posture is the posture in which the  joint-wheeled mobile robot responds correctly to the local singular  terrain.  (Edited abstract) 8 Refs.

Abstract: A work cell with multiple robots increases manufacturing flexibility  and productivity.  Robots in the work cell equipped in a sparse area  usually share a motion path, resources and workspace.  In this paper, an embedded Markov chain model for a multi-robot system that has a  common workspace is constructed on the basis of the concept of a  multi-processor system.  With the presented model, we measure the  performance of error recovery schemes under different workloads and  analyze the sensitivity of the execution time with respect to the  robot speed.  We verify the presented model with an experimental  multi-robot work cell.  This study is useful in evaluating the  performance of a robotic work cell and presents a guide for  designing a complex work cell.  23 Refs.

Title: Tracking control of mobile robots without constraint on velocities
Abstract: A general tracking control problem for mobile robots is proposed and  solved using the backstepping technique.  A global result is given  for the kinematic steering system to make the tracking error  approaching to zero asymptotically.  Based on our efforts, the  proposed controller can solve both the tracking problem and the  regulation problem of mobile robots.  In particular, mobile robots  can now globally follow any differentiable with bounded velocities  path such as a straight line, a circle and the path approaching to  the origin using the proposed controller.  Moreover, the problem of  back-into-garage parking is also solved by our approach.  Some  interesting simulation results are given to illustrate the  effectiveness of the proposed tracking control laws.  27 Refs.

Title: On dynamic stability of manipulators mounted on mobile platforms
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a model which can adequately  simulate the dynamic stability of manipulators mounted on moveable  platforms.  The model takes into account the dynamics of the base  that can potentially rock back-and-forth.  Particularly, the model  predicts the changes in the velocities of the manipulator links and  the base due to impact with the ground.  The application of the study is directed at industrial machines that carry human-operated  hydraulic manipulators.  The model is therefore used to simulate for  the first time, planar movements of a Caterpillar 215B  excavator-based log-loader.  The results clearly show the effect of  the manipulator movement on turning the base over.  The results also  show that by proper manipulation of the arms, one can achieve a  stable condition and even reverse the 'tipover' situation in such  machines.  14 Refs.

A set of target groups (set of  hypothesized targets originated from one measurement) is used and  refined by each measurement using an extended Kalman filter and  Bayesian conditional probability.  Experimental results in a real  indoor environment are presented to show the validity of our  algorithm.  21 Refs.

A neural network with fuzzy  inference (fuzzy neural network, FNN) presented can effectively  improve the learning speed of the neural network.  The method can be  used to control a mobile robot based on the present motion  situations of the robot in real-time; these situations include the  distances in different directions between the obstacles and the  robot provided by ultrasonic sensors, the target orientation sensed  by a simple optical range-finder and the movement direction of the  robot.  Simulation results showed that the above method can quickly  map the fuzzy relationship between the inputs and the output of the  control system of the mobile robot. copy 2001 Elsevier Sciece Ltd.

Title: Odometry error correction by sensor fusion for autonomous mobile  robot navigation
Abstract: A low cost navigation system is developed fusing inertial sensor  information provided by gyroscopes and a dometry information.  Both  Kalman filters and a rule set based fusion strategy is used to  correct the odometry errors in orientation for mobile robots.  The  fusion system even improves orientation estimation using a gyroscope with an extreme high drift rate.  This navigation system is  implemented on the autonomous mobile robot B21.  The performance of  this fusion method is tested on different surfaces and orientation  error does not grow as the robot travels along.  Experimental results demonstrate that even in harsh environments with obstacles the  performance of the designed navigation system reduces odometry  tracking errors.  The effects of nonsystematic odometry errors caused by unpredictable large bumps or objects encounter on the flor are  reduced.  12 Refs.

Further  decomposition of real-time systems can be provided by hiding the  sensor properties from the application program.  Therefore, a data  structure that represents a model of the environments is introduced.  This extra interface reduces the complexity of the application and  enables reuse of the application code.  Finally, an application of  the presented concepts is described in a case study featuring a  mobile robot.  17 Refs.

Title: A convergence proof of a fusion algorithm of global and local  path-planning for multiple mobile robots
Abstract: First of all, a global path-planning algorithm synchronously selects  shortest paths of multiple mobile robots.  Therefore, it is time  consuming because of hard combination search.  On the other hand, a  local path-planning algorithm independently selects a shorter path  of each mobile robot.  Therefore, it is not time consuming because of non-combination search.  However, we must consider the following two  problems: (1) Several types of collisions of two or more robots  should be solved.  (2) Convergence of all robots to their  destinations should be theoretically ensured.  To solve these  problems, we design a fusion algorithm by mixing global and local  path-planning algorithms, and then we give a proof such that all  robots arrive at their destinations in this paper.  11 Refs.

Title: Motion planning of a mobile robot as a discrete optimization problem
Abstract: In a previous paper, we proposed a solution to motion planning of a  mobile robot.  In our approach, we formulated the problem as a  discrete optimization problem at each time step.  To solve the  optimization problem, we used an objective function consisting of a  goal term, a smoothness term and a collision term.  In this paper, we propose a theoretical method using reinforcement learning for  adjusting weight parameters in the objective functions.  However, the conventional Q-learning method cannot be applied to a non-Markov  decision process, which is caused by the smoothness term.  Thus, we  applied William's learning algorithm, episodic REINFORCE, to derive  a learning rule for the weight parameters.  This maximizes a value  function stochastically.  We verified the learning rule by some  experiments.  7 Refs.

This decision is influenced by the energetic  capacity of their batteries and the contingencies of their  environments.

Title: Learning structured reactive navigation plans from executing MDP  navigation policies
Abstract: Autonomous robots, such as robot office couriers, need navigation  routines that support flexible task execution and effective action  planning.  This paper describes XFRMLEARN, a system that learns  structured symbolic navigation plans.  Given a navigation task,  XFRMLEARN learns to structure continuous navigation behavior and  represents the learned structure as compact and transparent plans.   The structured plans are obtained by starting with monolithical  default plans that are optimized for average performance and adding  subplans to improve the navigation performance for the given task.   Compactness is achieved by incorporating only subplans that achieve  significant performance gains.  The resulting plans support action  planning and opportunistic task execution.  XFRMLEARN is implemented  and extensively evaluated on an autonomous mobile robot.  3 Refs.

The algorithm of the presented method is based on A* graph searching with the nodes placed in the  discretized configuration space.  This paper is focused on the  analysis of different heuristic cost functions and introduces a new  statement of this function.  The presented method is equipped with  the procedures of fast path replanning - very useful in partially  known workspaces.  The series of simulation tests and experimental  results of online control for car-like robot are also discussed.   (Author abstract) 7 Refs.

Title: Mobile robot self-localization using occupancy histograms and a  mixture of Gaussian location hypotheses
Abstract: The topic of mobile robot self-localization is often divided into the sub-problems of global localization and position tracking.  Both are  now well understood individually, but few mobile robots can deal  simultaneously with the two problems in large, complex environments.  In this paper, we present a unified approach to global localization  and position tracking which is based on a topological map augmented  with metric information.  This method combines a new scan matching  technique, using histograms extracted from local occupancy grids,  with an efficient algorithm for tracking multiple location  hypotheses over time.  The method was validated with experiments in a series of real world environments, including its integration into a  complete navigating robot.  The results show that the robot can  localize itself reliably in large, indoor environments using minimal computational resources.  (Author abstract) 29 Refs.

Title: Distributed control for 3D metamorphosis
Abstract: In this paper, we define Proteo as a class of three-dimensional (3D)  metamorphic robotic system capable of approximating arbitrary 3D  shapes by utilizing repeated modules.  Each Proteo module contains  embedded sensors, actuators and a controller, and each resides in a  3D grid space.  A module can move itself to one of its open neighbor  sites under certain motion constraints.  Distributed control for the  self-reconfiguration of such robots is an interesting and  challenging problem.  We present a class of distributed control  algorithms for the reconfiguration of Proteo robots based on the   goal-ordering' mechanism.  Performance results are shown for  experiments of these algorithms in a simulation environment, and the properties of these algorithms are analyzed.  (Author abstract) 20  Refs.

Title: The MUSES-CN nanorover mission and related technology
Abstract: Recent advances in microtechnology and mobile robotics have made it  feasible to create extremely small automated or remote-controlled  vehicles which open new application frontiers.  One of these possible applications is the use of nanorovers (robotic vehicles with a mass  of order 1 Kg or less) in planetary exploration.  NASA and Japan's  Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) are cooperating  on the first mission to collect samples from the surface of an  asteroid and return them to Earth for in-depth study.  The ISAS  MUSES-C mission will be launched on a Japanese launch vehicle in  July 2002 from Japan toward a redezvous with the asteroid 1989ML in  September 2003.  A NASA-provided nanorover will conduct in-situ  measurements on the surface.  Asteroid samples will be returned to  Earth by MUSES-C via a parachute-borne recovery capsule in June  2006.  This paper describes the rover being created for this mission  and related technology developments.  5 Refs.

Title: Motion and shape parameters identification with vision and range
Abstract: In this paper, in order to get the better identification of motion  and shape parameters of a plane dynamics, we now consider that we  apply the laser range finder data with vision using both of a single laser range finder and a single CCD camera mounted on a mobile robot platform.  The laser range finder makes a line on the moving plane  along a horizontal laser plane.  Namely the laser range finder  observes a cross section of the phase as a line.  We use this  time-varying line information for motion and shape parameter  identification problems and show that when we use the laser range  finder data with vision as the observation data the dimension of the parameter ambiguity in the only vision case can be reduced.  10 Refs.

Title: Application of shared control strategy in the design of a robotic  device
Abstract: A new paradigm in the design and control of assistive robotic devices is the notion of Shared Control.  Shared control devices can be  categorized as a class of robotics where both the human and  mechanism are in direct cooperation in accomplishing a given task.   The information and power are distributed and interconected between  the agents.  This way one may be able to accomplish tasks which takes advantage of the information and power capabilities of both agents.   This paper presents an application of the above concept in the  design of a surgical tool which is used in the minimally invasive  surgery.  The paper presents a summary of the design integration and  performance analysis of such concept.  6 Refs.

Title: Design of steering mechanism and control of nonholonomic trailer  systems
Abstract: A wheeled mobile robot with trailers has been studied as a class of  nonholonomic systems.  It is proved that a system of a tractor and  trailers with an appropriate connecting mechanism can be stabilized  to desired positions via nonholonomic motion control.  Trailers, on  the other hand, have been developed and widely used in the industry.  The main focus of industrial design is set on reducing tracking  error from a reference trajectory.  This paper attempts to bridge  over the gap between these two approaches.  We develop a design  theory of trailer systems with passive steering.  The designed  systems show a good performance in practical path following, and  accept the chained form transformation and nonlinear control  strategies for nonholonomic systems.  17 Refs.

Title: Motion control of two-wheeled welding mobile robot with seam tracking sensor
Abstract: This paper describes development results of a 2 wheeled welding  mobile robot with seam tracking sensor touched on welding line.  The  motion control is realized in the view of keeping constant welding  velocity and precise seam line even though the target welding line  is on straight or curved one.  The body position and direction are  controlled by using signal errors between two potentiometer type of  touched sensors attached on torch slider and body side.  In turning  motion, the body and torch slider are controlled by using the  kinematic mathematical model related with two motions of body  turning and torch sliding.  The straight locomotion is controlled  according to 11 control patterns obtained from displacements between seam tracking sensor and body positioning sensor.  The effectiveness  is proven through the experimental results for arc welding machine.   5 Refs.

Title: Complete coverage navigation of clean robot based on triangular cell  map
Abstract: This paper presents a novel navigation method of the clean robot in  the unknown workspace.  In order to do this, we propose a map  representation method and a complete coverage navigation method.   First, we discuss a triangular cell map representation which makes  the clean robot navigate shorter path and more flexibly than a  rectangular cell map representation due to the increase in the  navigation direction.  Then, we propose a complete coverage  navigation and map construction method which enable the clean robot  to navigate the workspace completely, although it has perfectly no  information about environment.  Finally, we evaluate the performance  of our proposed triangular cell map comparing with that of the  rectangular cell map via the existing distance transform path  planning method.  And we also verify the proposed complete coverage  navigation method through several examples and computer simulations.  7 Refs.

Abstract: The position control problem of a nonholonomic mobile robot has been  an important class of control problems.  It receives a task from  human operator, and must perform the given task in the environment  including a lot of obstacles such as human bodies and other robots.   Therefore the mobile robot must perform given tasks and path  planning by itself.  In this paper we discuss an intelligent tracking control of navigating a mobile robot in an unknown environment.   Through suggested intelligent control, a mobile robot is able to  perform minimizing the distance to the moving goal by online motion  planning from actual sensor data.  Simulation shows that the  effectiveness of accurate tracking capability and the robust  performance of proposed scheme.  5 Refs.

Abstract: The artificial potential field methods provide simple and effective  motion planners for practical purpose.  However, there is a major  problem with artificial potential field approach.  It is the  formation of local minima that can trap the robot before reaching  it's goal.  The avoidance of local minima has been an active research topic in potential field path planning.  As one of the powerful  techniques for escaping local minima, simulated annealing which has  been applied to local and global path planning.

Title: Formation control based on artificial intelligence for multi-agent  coordination
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method of cooperative control based on  artificial intelligent system in distributed autonomous robotic  system.  In general, multi-agent behavior algorithm is simple and  effective for small number of robots.  However the number of robot  goes on increasing, this becomes difficult to be realized because a  multi-robot behavior algorithm requires multiple constraints and  goals in mobile robot navigation problems.  As the solution of above  problem, we propose an architecture of fuzzy system for each robot  speed control and fuzzy-neuro system for obstacle avoidance.   Controller adopts a simple reactive navigation strategy by combining repulsion from obstacles with attraction to a goal.  Simulation  results shows that the proposed strategy is effective for  multi-robot to avoid obstacles while maintaining a formation.  8  Refs.

Abstract: This paper presents a vision based autonomous navigation system for  mobile robots in an indoor environment by teaching and playing-back  scheme.  The system uses an omnidirectional image sensor to perceive  the environment, and extracts vertical edges as feature lines.  The  system memorizes a sequence of environmental images and robot's  poses during teaching stage.  In the course of play- back navigation, the system calculates the robot's position difference from the  memorized and currently taken images, and then decides the  trajectory to track the taught route.

Title: Optical guidance system for multiple mobile robots
Abstract: This paper describes our research work towards the development of an  optical guidance system for multiple mobile robots in an indoor  environment.  The guidance system operates with an environmental  model, communicates with mobile robots and indicates their target  positions by means of a light projection from a laser pointer onto  the ground.  Processing the image data from a CCD color camera  mounted on the mobile robot allows it to detect the laser light  beacon on the ground and estimate its relative coordinates.  The  robot's control system ensures the accurate motion of the robot to  the indicated target position.  The guidance system subsequently  indicates target positions corresponding to a desired route for a  specified mobile robot in the fleet.  The concept of the optical  guidance system, its implementation and experimental results  obtained are discussed.  11 Refs.

Title: An extension of the Plan-Merging Paradigm for multi-robot  coordination
Abstract: This paper reports on our recent efforts to extend the Plan-Merging  Paradigm, in order to improve its ability to adapt to various  execution contexts.  They concern the algorithmic as well as the  architectural issues.  The scheme can now be parameterized, allowing  to choose and even to update on-line robot, priorities, and to take  into account various constraints imposed by the application.  These  lead to different coordination policies.  The architectural  improvements allowed a better distribution of the computation load,  leading to more complex applications as, for instance, the  coordination of multiple mobile manipulators.  The result is a more  flexible scheme that should widen its application fields.  We  describe the main ingredients of this new scheme and illustrate its  implementation through two examples.  16 Refs.

Title: Tracking control of multiple mobile robots - A case study of  inter-robot collision-free problem
Abstract: A virtual robot tracking control approach with a consideration of  clearance is proposed, in the same time, an algorithm which intends  to avoid collision between robots is also introduced using a  transformation of Cartesian to distance coordinate.  Each robot is  indexed by different number, priority number to indicate that which  robot is prior to another.  A small-interval feedback control is  applied to a low-priority robot to avoid collision with the higher  one when it detects a possibility of collision.  At the end of  small-interval feedback control, the collision-free condition is  established.  The virtual robot tracking control is applied again to  maintain the overall formation.  As a result, the distribution of  robots in a system is guaranteed to be in limited communication  range along the motion.  Numerical simulation highlights the  efficiency of our control techniques.  8 Refs.

Title: Using coded signals to benefit from ultrasonic sensor crosstalk in  mobile robot obstacle avoidance
Abstract: One problem oftentimes observed with arrays of multiple ultrasonic  sensors (sonars) in obstacle detection and avoidance systems is  crosstalk.  This paper presents a novel method, in which data  generated by crosstalk is actually used to generate more reliable  and accurate object detection.  This is accomplished by assigning a  unique code to the signals emitted by each sonar, so that the source sonar can be identified even if its signal's echo is received by  another sonar.  Using geometric interpolation between the various  sonars increases the accuracy of the measurements, overcoming their  limited resolution.  Experimental results show the potential of our  system for mobile robotics obstacle detection and avoidance, as well as for localization using map-matching techniques.  14 Refs.

Title: Pose-and-twist estimation of a rigid body using accelerometers
Abstract: An algorithm for estimating the pose and twist of a rigid body using  measurements made by a redundant number of on-board accelerometers  is formulated.  Redundancy helps reduce the effect of the  accelerometer noise.  This algorithm is based only on rigid-body  kinematics because it is intended to be used for rigid bodies acted  upon by forces and moments elusive to modelling.  Procedures are  developed to calculate the angular velocity and acceleration as well as the attitude of the body along with the velocity and position of  the centroid of the pickup points, all in the body frame.  It is  shown that a small installation error can cause the integration  results to become unstable.  This instability is compensated for by  means of a pose-measurement sensor.  13 Refs.

Title: Mobile robot navigation using a sensor-based control strategy
Abstract: This work presents a new methodology for navigating mobile robots in  unknown environments based on the robot's perception.  The  interaction between the robot and the environment is modelled and  control laws are designed so that the robot is constrained to move  on the Voronoi Diagram of the environment.  The proposed method  enables the robot to explore an unknown scene without any reference  trajectory or any prior knowledge about the environment and avoiding the obstacles.  We are applying this approach on an indoor mobile  robot using a 2-D Laser Range Finder.  We show that the displacement  errors remain bounded when the movements of the robot are  constrained by sensor based control laws, that results in a precise  self-localization and reliable map building.  Experimental results  shown in this article validate this methodology.  8 Refs.

Title: A controllability test and motion planning primitives for  overconstrained vehicles
Abstract: Conventional nonholonomic motion planning and control theories do not directly apply to "overconstrained vehicles," such as the Sojourner  vehicle of the Mars Pathfinder mission.  This paper discusses some  basic issues of motion planning and control for this potentially  important class of mobile robots.  A power dissipation approach is  used to model the governing equations of overconstrained vehicles  that move quasi-statically.  These equations are shown to be switched hybrid systems.  Notions from standard geometric control, such as the Lie bracket, are extended to these switched systems.  We then develop a controllability test for such systems.  We explore motion planning  primitives in the context of simplified examples.  8 Refs.

Title: Visual avoidance of moving obstacles based on vector field  disturbances
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method for real time obstacle  avoidance using visual information.  It is based on our on-going  research on vector fields and potential functions associated to  successful motion planning algorithms.  Specifically, this paper  addresses the avoidance of dynamic obstacles, which have the  property of producing instabilities in the navigation vector field  associated to a planning algorithm.  We show how avoidance maneuvers  can be seen as a reaction to potential field instabilities measured  by the moving robot.  The paper briefly summarizes the analytical  derivation of this approach, and discusses the results of planning  experiments carried out using a Nomad200 robot with a landmark-based planning and navigation system.  15 Refs.

Title: Computation of time optimal movements for autonomous parking of  non-holonomic mobile platforms
Abstract: In this paper we present a method for calculation time-optimal  movements for parking of non-holonomic mobile platforms.  The parking problem is considered as specialization of the general problem of  path planning for nonholonomic robots.  This is formulated as a  non-linear optimal control problem and solved using advanced  numerical methods.  The concept of artificial potential field is used for accounting for the obstacles in the environment.  This method  allows to compute the time-optimal control for all possible parking  configurations (parallel, diagonal, row parking).  The experiments  show that using this method the movements for different complex  situations can be calculated in a timely fashion.  13 Refs.

Title: Dynamic gestures as an input device for directing a mobile platform
Abstract: Giving advice to a mobile robot still requires classical user  interfaces.  A more intuitive way of commanding can be provided by  verbal or gesture commands.  In this article, we present new  approaches and enhancements for established methods that are in use  in our laboratory.  Our aim is to direct a robot with simple dynamic  gestures.  Within this paper we will concentrate on visual gesture  recognition.  Based on skin color segmentation algorithms for  tracking the user's hand, hidden Markov models will be used for  gesture type recognition.  Filter's applied to the recorded  trajectory strongly compress the input data.  They also mark start  and end point of a possible gesture.  The hidden Markov models have  been enhanced by a threshold model in order to wipe out  insignificant movements.  Pre-classification of the reference  gestures serves for keeping computational effort low.  22 Refs.

Firstly, kinematic models of various type of wheels are derived including  skidding and sliding velocities.  Then the method of augmented  generalized coordinates is applied to obtain inverse and forward  kinematic models.  The kinematic models derived by the direct inverse of the augmented matrices provide an accurate solution, which was  not achievable by the modeling method based on the pseudo-inverse  method which provides an approximate solution.  Lastly, two kinematic models for typical. diffrential-driven mobile robots are presented  to show the effectiveness of the proposed modeling method.  5 Refs.

Title: Body trajectory generation for legged locomotion systems using a  terrain evaluation approach
Abstract: The path generation for legged locomotion systems is difficult in  that the legged motion must be considered together with the body  movement.  Owing to the large searching space resulted from the  combination of leg movement and terrain condition, it is quite time  consuming to produce an optimal result of body trajectory planning.   In, this paper, an effective method of body trajectory planning is  introduced by virtue of a terrain evaluation that links the terrain  condition with the machine mobility.  Base on the evaluation, a  potential field is constructed for the graph searching.  The Best  First Planning (BFP) is adopted to search the optimal path.  The path generated with the proposed method could offer the best opportunity  to place the machine feet moving with a certain gait over a rough  terrain.  11 Refs.

The legs are  connected to the driving units with spherical joints and to the  upper plate with a revolute joint.  Three additional encoders,  attached to the upper revolute joints provide redundant data.  This  data is used by a kinematic model for accurate estimation of the  robot's configuration and position in space, even in rough terrains, where conventional odometry fails.  Simulation results show the  advantages of the design, and suggest a method for detection of  irregularities of surfaces in unknown environments.  13 Refs.

Title: Human-like actuated walking that is asymptotically stable without  feedback
Abstract: This paper studies a two-legged kneed walking robot with point feet.   At any given moment, only one foot is in contact with the ground,  and the switching is instantaneous.  The robot can be considered as a simplified model of human walking.  The periodic torque histories  applied to each link are a priori prescribed for a motion and are  not changed by any feedback interference.  Nevertheless the robot is  capable of naturally recovering from perturbations, returning to  standard gait - a property that we call open-loop stable.  We  formulate the problem of open-loop stabilization as an optimal  control problem.  Design parameters and periodic torque inputs that  lead to a stable configuration are computed using a two-level  optimization procedure.  We believe that this is the first  demonstration of the ability to create stable actuated open-loop  gaits of bipedal walking robots.  10 Refs.

This contrasts with previous  approaches, that rely on the existence of a model of the sensor's  dynamics.  The complete system is able to orient and turn towards the source.  An experimental validation was carried out to evaluate the  performance of the system.  15 Refs.

Title: Planning and obstacle avoidance for mobile robots
Abstract: A planning methodology for nonholonomic mobile manipulators that  employs smooth and continuous functions such as polynomials is  developed.  The method decouples kinematically the manipulator from  the platform by constructing admissible paths that drive it to a  final configuration and is based on mapping the nonholonomic  constraint to a space where it can be trivially satisfied.  In  addition, the method allows for direct control over the platform  orientation.  The developed transformation also maps Cartesian space  obstacles to transformed ones and allows for obstacle avoidance by  increasing the order of the polynomials that are used in planning  trajectories.  The additional parameters required are computed  systematically.  It is shown how the method can be extended for  avoiding obstacles of any number.  12 Refs.

Abstract: In the scanning electron microscope, many studies require  micromanipulation tools that can be flexibly and comfortably used  for the handling and positioning of objects ranging from few  millimeters down to fractions of microns.  In this paper, some  aspects of the control of small mobile microrobots by teleoperation  are addressed facing the special behavior of their piezoelectric  actuators and the challenge of handling tasks in ranges of very  different orders of magnitude (100 nm - 100 mm).  In order to give  the teleoperated tweezers a kind of low-level "intelligence", a  control loop using the SEM as a sensor system is being developed.  In different open-loop handling experiments, the employed 6D-mouse  proves satisfactory as an intuitive user interface.  7 Refs.

Title: Collision prediction and avoidance amidst moving objects for  trajectory planning applications
Abstract: In this paper, a novel methodology for computing a collision-free  trajectory for mobile robots amidst moving objects is presented.   This planner is based on a new technique for computing the minimum  translational distance between two mobile objects.  This distance is  then used for predicting and avoiding a collision.  The computation  of this distance is based on the application of the GJK algorithm  [6] to a particular subset of the Minkowski difference set of the involved objects.  This subset states the  separation or penetration distance between two objects along their  given motions.  When a collision is predicted, a collision-free  intermediate temporal-position is generated avoiding such a  collision.  12 Refs.

Abstract: This paper presents a new method for control of autonomous mobile  robots to acquire fine actions base d on the real-time search.  In  the proposed method, the information criterion for the environment  is defined based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which measures  the quality of the environmental information used for the action  search.  The robot searches suitable actions based on the  environmental information which is improved step by step in the  sense of this criterion.  According to this, we can harmonize the  trade-off between the calculation amount and information quality,  and make the search process faster.  In this paper, the proposed  method is applied to the moving obstacles avoidance problem, and  show its usefulness through some simulation results.  10 Refs.

The non-linear v-obstacle  allows selecting a single avoidance maneuver (if one exists) that  avoids any number of obstacles moving on any known trajectories.  For unknown trajectories, the non-linear v-obstacles can be used to  generate local avoidance maneuvers based on the current velocity and path curvature of the moving obstacle.  This elevates the planning  strategy to a second order method, compared to the first order  avoidance using the linear v-obstacle, and zero order avoidance  using only position information.  Analytic expressions for the  non-linear v-obstacle are derived for general trajectories in the  plane.  The non-linear v-obstacles are demonstrated in a complex  traffic example.  4 Refs.

Title: Path planning for newly developed microrover
Abstract: This paper describes a path planning method for a planetary  microrover to make a path on planetary surface.  A planetary rover is required to travel safely over a long distance for many days in  unfamiliar terrain.  Hence it is very important how a planetary rover processes sensory information to understand the environment and to  make decisions.  The authors have developed a newly small rover for  future lunar or planetary exploration.  As a new data structure for a map information, an extended elevation map has been introduced,  which includes the effect of the size of the rover.  The proposed  path planning can be conducted in such a way as if the rover were a  point while the size of the rover is automatically taken into  account.  A map obtained by sensors includes uncertainty.  So a path  planning scheme based on traversability probability is also  proposed.  The validity of the proposed method is verified by  computer simulations.  16 Refs.

Title: Optimal landmark pattern for precise mobile robots dead-reckoning
Abstract: The aim of this work is to determine the best landmark for its use in tasks such as precise positioning of AGVs or mobile robots in front  of loading / unloading areas.  The work developed aims at determining the precision that can be achieved with different pattern landmarks, of use in positioning systems, based on computer vision.  Different  computer vision algorithms have been tested from the images acquired from different camera configurations and bending angles with respect to the vertical axis.  As a result of the evaluation of these errors, we extract the recommendation of the most favourable bicolour  pattern to be used, as well as the bounding errors obtained from the segmentation and recognition methods most frequently used.  8 Refs.

Title: Greedy mapping of terrain
Abstract: We study a greedy mapping method that always moves the robot from its current location to the closest location that it has not visited (or observed) yet, until the terrain is mapped.  Although one does not  expect such a simple mapping method to minimize the travel distance  of the robot, we present analytical results that show (perhaps  surprisingly) that the travel distance of the robot is reasonably  small.  This is interesting because greedy mapping has a number of  desirable properties.  It is simple to implement and integrate into  complete robot architectures.  It does not need to have control of  the robot at all times, takes advantage of prior knowledge about  parts of the terrain (if available), and can be used by several  robots cooperatively.  31 Refs.

Title: Sensor fusion for mobile robot dead-reckoning with a  precision-calibrated fiber optic gyroscope
Abstract: Recently, fiber optic gyros with very low drift rates have become  available and affordable.  Because of their low drift rate attention  is warranted to sources of errors that were previously considered as of secondary importance.  In the KVH E-Core RD2100 gyros, we found  that the temperature dependency and the non-linearity of the  scale-factor caused significant errors.  A precision calibration  procedure, described in this paper, reduces the resulting errors by  one order of magnitude.  In addition to the calibration procedure, we integrated the gyro with the odometry system of a four-wheel drive.   skid-steer Pioneer AT mobile robot by means of an indirect feedback  Kalman filter that fuses the sensor data from both sensor  modalities.  Based on our experimental results this paper compares  the relative effectiveness of both enhancements (precision gyro  calibration and Kalman filter).  11 Refs.

Title: Motion planning of legged vehicles in an unstructured environment
Abstract: A planner for statically-stable motion of a legged robotic vehicle  over an uneven terrain is presented that can plan the footplacement  of individual legs for highly cluttered terrain.  A method for  determining the traversability over a generic discretised height map terrain is presented.  Planning is broken into two levels of  refinement to reduce the overall complexity and incorporates a  number of heuristics.  The planner has successfully planned the  motion of 6 and 8 legged configurations of the XEROX PARC PolyBot  modular reconfigurable robot as well as the CMU Ambler in simulation over arbitrarily complex terrain.  A distributed implementation of  the planner has also been shown on Poly- Bot's distributed  computational platform.  14 Refs.

Title: Back and forward moving scheme of front wheel raising for inverse  pendulum control wheel chair robot
Abstract: A power assist wheel chair robot by which a patient can climb over  steps/curbs without any helper's assistance is proposed.  A patient  can maintain inverse pendulum control of the wheel chair after  raising its front wheels.  Next, a patient can move to the step  maintaining the inverse pendulum control, and can climb over the  step being assisted by DC motor force.  A light weight wheel chair  system was optimally designed using small DC motors.  The system  required the patient's assistance to start the front wheel raising.   A new front wheel raising scheme is proposed in this paper, which  does not require the patient's assistance.  The new scheme is using  the back and forward moving scheme in which the wheel chair goes  back first and then goes forward in order to start the front wheel  raising.  7 Refs.

Title: Interoperability and synchronisation of distributed  hardware-in-the-loop simulation for underwater robot development:  Issues and experiments
Abstract: Development and integration of subsystems on advanced robots such as  unmanned underwater vehicles, can benefit from the availability of a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation facility.  Although complete  interoperability of simulated and real subsystems appears desirable, substantial additional complexity of data flows and hardware can be  introduced.  Where non-real time simulations are involved, methods of synchronising subsystems running at different speeds must be  employed, These should take account of the realities of starting and stopping real subsystem.  The paper reviews some of these issues and  presents the CORESIM distributed HIL system based around HLA.  The  system has been used to evaluate a timeslicing synchronisation  approach, and to assist in development of docking, visual servoing  and concurrent mapping & localisation systems for underwater  vehicles.  17 Refs.

Title: Design of continuous alternate wheels for omnidirectional mobile  robots
Abstract: Many types of omnidirectional wheels with passive rollers have a gap  between rollers.  This gap causing the wheel to make discontinuous  contact with the ground, leads to vertical and/or horizontal  vibrations.  In this paper a novel design of continuous alternate  wheel was proposed to minimize a gap between rollers.  In the  continuous alternate wheel, inner and outer rollers are arranged  continuously, thus resulting in no gap between the rollers.  This  paper details the design process including the systematic approaches to determine the optimum number of rollers, the radii of rollers and the inclination angle of the inside of an outer roller for given  design specifications.  Finally, an actual continuous alternate wheel is constructed to verify validity of the design guidelines.  7 Refs.

Title: A visual servoing algorithm based on epipolar geometry
Abstract: A visual servoing algorithm for mobile robots is proposed.  The main  feature of the algorithm is that it exploits object profiles rather  than solving correspondence problems using object features or  texture.  This property is crucial for mobile robot navigation in  unstructured environments where the 3D scene exhibits only surfaces  whose main features are their apparent contours.  The framework is  based on the epipolar geometry, which is recovered from object  profiles and epipolar tangencies.  Special symmetry conditions of  epipoles are used to generate the mobile robot control law.  For the  sake of simplicity, mobile robot kinematics is assumed to be  holonomic and the camera intrinsic parameters are assumed partially  known.  Such assumption can be relaxed to extend the application  field of the approach.  10 Refs.

Title: Generating linguistic spatial descriptions from sonar readings using  the histogram of forces
Abstract: In this paper, we show how linguistic expressions can be generated to describe the spatial relations between a mobile robot and its  environment, using readings from a ring of sonar sensors.  Our work  is motivated by the study of human-robot communication for  non-expert users.  The eventual goal is to use these linguistic  expressions for navigation of the mobile robot in an unknown  environment, where the expressions represent the qualitative state  of the robot with respect to its environment, in terms that are  easily understood by human users.  In the paper, we describe the  histogram of forces and its application to sonar sensors on a mobile robot.  Several environment examples are also included with the  generated linguistic descriptions.  14 Refs.

Title: Autonomous characterization of unknown environments
Abstract: Key to the autonomous exploration of an unknown area, by a scientific robotic rover is the ability of the vehicle to autonomously  recognize objects of interest and generalize about the region.  This  paper presents a Bayesian framework under which a mobile robot can  learn how different classes of objects are distributed over a  geographical region, using imperfect observations and non-random  sampling.  This yields dramatic improvements in classification  accuracy by exploiting the interdependencies between objects in an  area and allows the robot to autonomously characterize the region.   This is demonstrated with data from Carnegie Mellon University's  Nomad robot in Antarctica, where it traversed the ice sheet,  classifying rocks in its path.  8 Refs.

Title: On eye-sensor based path planning for robots with non-trivial  geometry/kinematics
Abstract: We formally pose and explore some novel issues that arise for  eye-sensor based motion planning for robots with non-trivial  geometry/kinematics.  The key issue is that while the sensor senses  in physical space, the planning takes place in configuration space,  and the two spaces are distinctly different for robots with non-  trivial geometry/kinematics.  This leads to some very interesting,  fundamental yet novel issues.  In particular, we introduce several  novel notions: notion of s-reachability, notion of s-completeness  that characterizes completeness for sensor-based planning  algorithms, notion of explorability of configuration space, and  notion of observability of physical space.  We give sufficient  conditions for a (discrete) eye-sensor based planner to be  s-complete.  17 Refs.

Title: Extracting navigation states from a hand-drawn map
Abstract: Being able to interact and communicate with robots in the same way we interact with people has long been a goal of AI and robotics  researchers.  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to  communicating a navigation task to a robot, which allows the user to sketch an approximate map on a PDA and then sketch the desired robot trajectory relative to the map.  State information is extracted from  the drawing in the form of relative, robot-centered spatial  descriptions, which are used for task representation and as a  navigation language between the human user and the robot, Examples  are included of two hand-drawn maps and the linguistic spatial  descriptions generated from the maps.  11 Refs.

Title: Robot behavior engineering using DD-Designer
Abstract: We present a novel robotic software development framework for rapid  simulation and programming of mobile robot teams.  The framework uses a specification- centred generative approach.  A robot control  program is specified in an intuitive graphical representation of a  hyper-graph of typed data processing elements.  This specification is automatically refined to all design artifacts required in a robotic  software development environment: simulation models, robot control  programs, team communication infrastructure, documentation, and  real-time monitoring.  Although our framework was originally intended to design behavior-based robot control programs using the Dual  Dynamics architecture, we demonstrate the flexibility of the  environment by an example which integrates a "classical" control  schema into a Dual Dynamics behavior system.  Experimental validation was done on GMD-Robots, our team of mid-size league RoboCup robots.   17 Refs.

Title: Tracking control of a mobile robot using a neural dynamics based  approach
Abstract: In this paper, a novel tacking control approach is proposed for  real-time navigation of a nonholonomic mobile robot.  The proposed  tracking controller is based on the error dynamics analysis of the  mobile robot and a neural dynamics model derived from Hodgkin and  Huxley's membrane model of a biological system.  The stability of the control system and the convergence of tracking errors to zeros are  guaranteed by a Lyapunov stability theory.  Unlike many tracking  control methods for mobile robot where the generated control  velocities start with large initial velocities, the proposed neural  dynamics based approach is capable of generating smooth, continuous  robot control signals with zero initial velocities.  In addition, it  can deal with the situation with a very large tracking error.  The  effectiveness and efficiency are demonstrated by comparison and  simulation studies.  9 Refs.

Title: Hybrid control of formations of robots
Abstract: We describe a framework for controlling a group of nonholonomic  mobile robots equipped with range sensors.  The vehicles are required to follow a prescribed trajectory while maintaining a desired  formation.  By using the leader-following approach, we formulate the  formation control problem as a hybrid (mode switching) control  system.  We then develop a decision module that allows the robots to  automatically switch between continuous-state control laws to  achieve a desired formation shape.  The stability properties of the  closed-loop hybrid system are studied using Lyapunov theory.  We do  not use explicit communication between robots; instead we integrate  optimal estimation techniques with nonlinear controllers.  Simulation and experimental results verify the validity of our approach.  14  Refs.

Title: Plane segment finder: Algorithm, implementation and applications
Abstract: This paper describes the development of a Plane Segment Finder, which is able to detect three-dimensional planar surfaces from input  images in real-time.

To achieve real-time plane  segment finding system, we apply 1) Recursive Correlation method for depth map generation, 2) Randomized Hough Transformation method for  plane segment extraction.  Finally, experimental results using an  implementation of our system along with a humanoid robot are shown.   11 Refs.

Title: Local accessibility and stabilization of an underactuated crawling  robot with changing constraints
Abstract: Underactuated systems are those processing fewer actuators than  degrees of freedom.  But generally they are difficult to control.  In  this paper we realize crawling motion by an underactuated robot.  By  changing the location of the fixed point of the robot to the  environment, the constraint of the system is changed.  Local  accessibility of the system with changing the constraints as a  nonhoronomic system is shown.  Control law based on partial feedback  linearization is proposed and stability of the closed-loop system is discussed.  We discuss trajectory planning of the robot based on the  geometric relation.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller experiments have been carried out.  9 Refs.

Title: A pursuit-evasion BUG algorithm
Abstract: We consider the problem of searching for an unpredictable moving  target, using a robot that lacks a map of the environment, lacks the ability to construct a map, and has imperfect navigation ability.  We present a complete algorithm, which yields a motion strategy for the robot that guarantees the elusive target will be detected, if such a strategy exists.  It is assumed that the robot has an omnidirectional sensing device that is used to detect moving targets and also  discontinuities in depth data in a 2D environment.  We also show that the robot has the same problem-solving power as a robot that has a  complete map and perfect navigation abilities.  The algorithm has  been implemented in simulation, and some examples are shown.  18  Refs.

Title: Parallelizing planning and action of a mobile robot based on  planning-action consistency
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to schedule parallel execution of  planning and action of a mobile robot.  The method considers the  following two types of parallelism.  (1) acting while planning: if a  partial planning result can be used to determine feasible actions,  such actions can be executed while the planning process is still  going.  (2) planning while acting: if the result of the current  action is (at least partially) predictable, the planning for the  next action can start in advance of the completion of the current  action.  The proposed method uses the notion of planning-action  consistency to guide the scheduling.  The method has been  successfully applied to a mobile robot navigation problem under  sensor uncertainty.  10 Refs.

Title: A fast path planning-and-tracking control for wheeled mobile robots
Abstract: This paper presents a fast method to plan the path, and control the  position of wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) in a robot soccer game.  In  a WMR system with position control, when the target position is  given, the controller will generate the reference path and then the  WMR will move to the target position following the reference path.   To tackle the difficulties of the nonlinear control problem, the  motion of the WMR is realized via changing the linear displacement  and angular displacement in a separate manner such that the WMR is  either rotating or moving in a straight line at any one time.  This  method takes advantage of a proposed fast path-planning algorithm.   The complexity of design is thus significantly reduced.  6 Refs.

There exit several research works such as snapshot model and average landmark  model which request the absolute bearing information (compass) and  visual one.  Whereas our method called relative angle model (RAM)  need only visual information in order to extract relative positions  of 3 landmarks.  By simulation and experiment using 3-d blimp-type  flying robot, we find that the pinpoint 3-D navigation works out  well by RAM.  12 Refs.

Title: An optimal pose estimator for map-based mobile robot dynamic  localization: Experimental comparison with the EKF
Abstract: Theoretical solutions based on the matching of 2-D range measurements with a map of the environment have been proposed to solve the robot  localization problem.  However, most of them have not been  experimented in real conditions: the robot was stopped or it moved  slowly during range data acquisition, and the environment was  supposed to be static.  In this paper, we propose and evaluate a  dynamic localization method based on feature matching.  Experiments  carried out in real cluttered indoor environments including people  and unknown obstacles show the good performance of the proposed  algorithm against the classical solution based on Kalman filtering.   12 Refs.

Title: Automatic extraction of visual landmarks for a mobile robot under  uncertainty of vision and motion
Abstract: This paper proposes a method to autonomously extract stable visual  landmarks from sensory data.  Given a 2D occupancy map, a mobile  robot first extracts vertical line features which are distinct and  on vertical planar surfaces, because they are expected to be  observed reliably firm various viewpoints.  Since the feature  information such as the position and the length includes  uncertainties due to errors of vision and motion of the robot, the  robot then reduces the uncertainty by matching the planar surface  containing the features to the map.  As a result, the robot obtains  modeled stable visual landmarks from the extracted features.  These  processes are performed on-line in order to adapt to actual changes  of lighting and scene depending on the robot's view.  Experimental  results in various scenes show the validity of the proposed method.   14 Refs.

Title: Range estimation from a pair of omnidirectional images
Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of recovering range information  from a pair of images obtained from camera viewpoints whose relative poses are known (stereo vision) .  The images we deal with are  cylindrical re-projections of images captured by an omnidirectional  vision sensor.  Images obtained by such a device have a relatively  low spatial resolution in comparison to standard camera images.  We  analyze the sensitivity of range estimation from image  correspondences with respect to errors caused by discretization.  The analysis reveals the significance of obtaining sub-pixel accuracy  for range estimation.  We present our method and experimental  results.  The results indicate that high accuracy range estimates can be obtained using our method.  12 Refs.

Title: Stereo ego-motion improvements for robust rover navigation
Abstract: Robust navigation for mobile robots over long distances requires an  accurate method for tracking the robot position in the environment.   Techniques for position estimation by determining the camera  ego-motion from monocular or stereo sequences have been previously  described.  However, long-distance navigation requires a very high  level of robustness and a very low rate of error growth.  In this  paper, we describe a methodology for long-distance rover navigation  that meets these goals using robust estimation.  We show that a  system based on only camera ego-motion estimates will accumulate  errors with super-linear growth in the distance traveled, owing to  increasing orientation errors.  When an absolute orientation sensor  is incorporated, the error growth can be reduced to a linear  function of the distance traveled.  We have tested these techniques  using both extensive simulation and hundreds of real rover images  and have achieved a low, linear rate of error growth.  10 Refs.

Title: A probabilistic on-line mapping algorithm for teams of mobile robots
Abstract: An efficient probabilistic algorithm for the concurrent mapping and  localization problem that arises in mobile robotics is presented.   The algorithm addresses the problem in which a team of robots builds a map on-line while simultaneously accommodating errors in the  robots' odometry.  At the core of the algorithm is a technique that  combines fast maximum likelihood map growing with a Monte Carlo  localizer that uses particle representations.  The combination of  both yields an on-line algorithm that can cope with large odometric  errors typically found when mapping environments with cycles.  The  algorithm can be implemented in a distributed manner on multiple  robot platforms, enabling a team of robots to cooperatively generate a single map of their environment.  Finally, an extension is  described for acquiring three-dimensional maps, which capture the  structure and visual appearance of indoor environments in three  dimensions.  93 Refs.

Abstract: We investigated a control method to realize the three different types of free giant swing motions produced by a two-link horizontal bar  gymnastic robot.  By evaluating the eigenvalues of the transitional  error matrix on the Poincare plane, it was found that the stable  giant swing motions could be obtained by a proposed configuration  control, in which the actuated joint torque is controlled such that  the measured state variables follow the reference configuration with respect to the angular position of the passive joint.  We also  demonstrated that the two types of stable giant swing motions could  be accomplished by the configuration method.  11 Refs.

Title: Vision-based real-time vehicle guidance on THMR-V part II: Obstacle  detection
Abstract: The ability to detect obstacles is essential for safe vehicle  guidance.  In this paper, we present a real-time low-cost obstacle  detection system using a pair of cameras.  With the assumption of a  ground plane, IPM (Inverse Perspective Mapping) is first used to  remove the perspective effect in the original images.  Free-space in  front of the vehicle is then detected by inspecting the difference  between the two ground images.  After a filter is applied to remove  the noise in the free-space image, obstacles are located using two  histograms.  This system has been tested on THMR-V (Tsinghua Mobile  Robot V), an intelligent vehicle developed at Tsinghua University.   Through various experiments we successfully demonstrate its  real-time performance and robustness with respect to different road  textures.  5 Refs.

Title: Object-oriented concepts for modular robotics systems
Abstract: In this paper we describe how object-oriented concepts can be  exploited in the design of modular robot systems.  The approach is  motivated in particular by the observation that when sensors or  end-effectors are mounted on mobile bases or at the end of  manipulator arms, they can be said to acquire, or 'inherit', motion  functionality.  Other aspects of modular robotics systems similarly  afford parallels with other object-oriented concepts, including  polymorphism, aggregation and encapsulation or abstraction.  The key  contribution of the model we describe is the way in which it  exploits qualitative descriptions of modules to reason about modules and their relationships in modular robot configurations.  The model  proposed is still in its infancy, but offers benefits directly to  modular robot system design (reducing software development efforts)  and to modular object systems in general.  10 Refs.

Title: Vision-based reinforcement learning for robot navigation
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel vision-based learning approach for  autonomous robot navigation.  A hybrid state-mapping model, which  combines the merits of both static and dynamic state assigning  strategies, is proposed to solve the problem of state organization  in navigation-learning tasks.  Specifically, the continuous feature  space, which could be very large in general, is firstly mapped to a  small-sized conceptual state space for learning in static.  Then,  ambiguities among the aliasing states, i.e., the same conceptual  state is accidentally mapped to several physical states that require different action policies in reality, are efficiently eliminated in  learning with a recursive state-splitting process.  The proposed  method has been applied to simulate the navigation learning by a  simulated robot with very encouraging results.  10 Refs.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with designing a neural network based  navigator that is optimized in a user-defined sense for a mobile  robot using ultrasonic sensors to travel to a goal position safely  and efficiently without any prior map of the environment.  The neural network has a dynamically reconfigurable structure that not only can optimize the weights but also the input sensory connectivity in  order to meet any user-defined objective.  Further, in order to  enhance generalization capability of a single network, a modular  network is used in which each network module is optimized for a  specific local environment based on environment classification.   After training all the modules, competitive and cooperative module  coordination methods are applied and compared.  Both computer  simulation and real experiments show the effective performance of  the algorithm.  13 Refs.

Title: Improved dead reckoning using caster wheel sensing on a  differentially steered 3-wheeled autonomous vehicle
Abstract: A differentially steered three-wheeled vehicle has proven to be an  effective platform for outdoor navigation.  Many applications for  this vehicle configuration, including planetary exploration and  landmine/UXO location, require accurate localization.  In spite of  known problems, odometry, also called dead reckoning, remains one of the least expensive and most popular methods for localization.  This  paper presents the results of an investigation into the benefits of  instrumenting the rear drive wheel encoders and the caster data.   This method can also be extended using the standard form of the  Kalman filter to allow for noise.  Improvements in position  estimation in the face of common problems such as slip and  dimensional errors are quantified.  10 Refs.

Title: Distributed robotic mapping of extreme environments
Abstract: In the extreme environments posed by war fighting, fire fighting, and nuclear accident response, the cost of direct human exposure is  levied in terms of injury and death.  Robotic alternatives must  address effective operations while removing humans from danger.  This is profoundly challenging, as extreme environments inflict  cumulative performance damage on exposed robotic agents.  Sensing and perception are among the most vulnerable components.  We present a  distributed robotic system that enables autonomous reconnaissance  and mapping in urban structures using teams of robots.  Robot teams  scout remote sites, maintain operational tempos, and successfully  execute tasks, principally the construction of 3-D Maps, despite  multiple agent failures.  Using an economic model of agent  interaction based on a free market architecture, a virtual platform  (a robot colony) is synthesized where task execution does not  directly depend on individual agents within the colony.  45 Refs.

Abstract: The Savannah River Site's (SRS) Environmental Restoration Division  (ERD) is in the process of reconditioning and decommissioning  potentially contaminated facilities.  Many of these facilities  require inspection prior to remediation tasks.  Remote inspections  are necessary to reduce hazards and ensure the health and safety of  workers and the public.  To aid in ERD's efforts, the Remote and  Specialty Equipment Systems (RSES) section developed a remote  inspection vehicle referred to as the Manhole Access Pipecrawler  System (MAPS).  The MAPS is comprised of a battery-powered mobile  vehicle, a portable control console, a cable reel enclosing 300' of  tethered cable, and a deployment/retrieval system.  The components  used in MAPS are predominantly standard off-the-shelf items to  reduce fabrication costs.  Parts were chosen based on size and  durability to satisfy SRS operating conditions.

Title: Probabilistic methods for robotic landmine search
Abstract: One way to improve the efficiency of a mine search, compared with a  complete coverage algorithm, is to direct the search based on the  spatial distribution of the minefield.  The key for the success of  this probabilistic approach is to efficiently extract the spatial  distribution of the minefield during the process of the search.  In  our research, we assume that a minefield follows a regular pattern,  which belongs to a family of known patterns.  Likelihood and Bayesian approaches to the pattern extraction algorithm are developed to  extract the underlying pattern of the minefield.  Both algorithms  perform well in their ability to catch the "actual" pattern.  And  both algorithms are efficient, therefore, online implement of the  algorithm on a mobile robot is possible.  Compared to the likelihood  approach, the advantage of using a Bayesian approach is that this  approach provides information about the uncertainty of the extracted "actual" pattern.  13 Refs.

Title: Sagittal gait of a biped robot during the single support phase. Part  1: Passive motion
Abstract: It has been shown that compass-like bipeds can walk passively by  gravity-induced motion.  Similarly, it has been stated that the  unipodal phase of human gait may be regarded as a passive motion.   This paper is aimed at determining precisely to what extent the  swing phase of human-like walking can be considered as a  non-actuated motion.  More specifically, a method is developed that  makes it possible to adjust initial conditions, step length and walk speed, as well as mass and inertia distribution of a bipedal robot,  in order to generate a passive swing motion.  The approach is  demonstrated by using a 7-link planar biped.  Numerical simulations  show that purely passive unipodal transferring cannot be fully  satisfactory.  This approach is further considered in Part 2 of the  paper which consists in computing optimal actuating joint torques to create perfectly feasible motions.  20 Refs.

Title: Capacity analysis for a hybrid indoor mobile communication system  using cellular and ad-hoc modes
Abstract: The authors have proposed a dual mode system for indoor mobile  communication.  Mobile terminals (MTs) in this system communicate  with each other directly or via BSs.  The former mode is regarded as  ad-hoc mode and the latter, as cellular mode.  The decision which  mode to use is given at an MT comparing the received power level  from its partner and a base station (BS).  The sharing approaches of  wireless resources, frequency and time, considered in the cellular  structure having two tiers can be applied to this dual mode indoor  system with substituting the concepts of communication modes for  cellular tiers.  Then the capacity can be derived.  In this paper, the capacity tradeoffs between the cellular mode and the ad-hoc mode for orthogonal sharing and spread-spectrum (SS) sharing are presented.  4 Refs.

We show the possibilities and limitation of conventional  stratified control approach through the relative simple example of  hexapod robot and offer some proposals for a more robust motion  planning solution.  The precision of the algorithms was improved by  step length modification and the applicability was increased by time scaling.  The developed software is based on symbolic computation.  On the other hand, our fundamental goal is to provide a powerful basic  concept for object manipulation with finger relocation in the  context of stratified control as an extension of earlier works.  The  concept focuses on the finger gaiting manipulation (based on finger  relocation) to gain some attributes of the nonsmooth object.  9 Refs.

Title: Mobile robot teleoperation system utilizing a virtual world
Abstract: This paper discusses the problems in teleoperation systems for a  mobile robot and the utilization of a virtual world in such systems.  In order to achieve smooth operation of the mobile robot through a  communication link, we should consider time delays in data transfer.  To compensate for the incomplete data sets, the virtual images can  be generated by computer graphics when the information on the  working environment can be acquired beforehand.  In this paper, we  construct a teleoperation system with a virtual world.  The  performance of the system is examined through experiments with  actual mobile robots which show that the virtual robot can be  operated by an operator in almost the same manner as the  teleoperated real robot.  In an experimental environment with a  second moving robot, we can keep the status of the second robot  under perfect control and operate the first robot with no  interference.  17 Refs.

Title: Using a new model of recurrent neural network for control
Abstract: This paper shows the results obtained in controlling a mobile robot  by means of local recurrent neural networks based on a radial basis  function (RBF) type architecture.  The model used has a Finite  Impulse Response (FIR) filter feeding back each neuron's output to  its own input, while using another FIR filter as a synaptic  connection.  The network parameters (coefficients of both filters)  are adjusted by means of the gradient descent technique, thus  obtaining the stability conditions of the process.  As a practical  application the system has been successfully used for controlling a  wheelchair, using an architecture made up by a neurocontroller and a neuroidentifier.  The role of the latter, connected up in parallel  with the wheelchair, is to propagate the control error to the  neurocontroller, thus cutting down the control error in each working cycle.  17 Refs.

Title: Sensor-based probabilistic roadmaps: Experiments with an eye-in-hand  system
Abstract: We present a real implemented eye-in-hand test-bed system for  sensor-based collision-free motion planning for articulated robot  arms.  The system consists of a PUMA 560 with a triangulation-based  area-scan laser range finder (the eye) mounted on its wrist.  The  framework for our planning approach is inspired by recent motion  planning research for the classical model-based case (known  environment) and incrementally builds a roadmap that represents the  connectivity of the free configuration space, as the robot senses  the physical environment.  We present some experimental results with  our sensor-based planner running on this real test-bed.  The robot is started in completely unknown and cluttered environments.  Typically, the planner is able to reach (planning as it senses) the goal  configuration in about 7-25 scans (depending on the scene  complexity), while avoiding collisions with the obstacles  throughout.  25 Refs.

Title: Control of the Gyrover: A single-wheel gyroscopically stabilized  robot
Abstract: The Gyrover is a single-wheel gyroscopically stabilized mobile robot  developed at Carnegie Mellon University.  An internal pendulum serves as a counter weight for a drive motor that causes fore/aft motion,  while a large gyroscope on a tilt mechanism provides for lateral  balance and steering actuation.  In this paper, we develop a detailed dynamic model for the Gyrover and use this model in an extended  Kalman filter to estimate the complete state.  A linearized version  of the model is used to develop a state feedback controller.  The  design methodology is based on a semi-definite programming procedure which optimizes the stability region subject to a set of linear  matrix inequalities that capture stability and pole placement  constraints.  Finally, the controller design combined with the  extended Kalman filter are verified on the robot prototype.  11 Refs.

Title: Near-time-optimal trajectory planning for wheeled mobile robots with  translational and rotational sections
Abstract: We derive a near-time-optimal trajectory for wheeled mobile robots  (WMRs) satisfying the following: 1) initial and final  postures/velocities as well as 2) battery voltage and armature  current constraints, under assumptions of simplified dynamics and  constant translational/rotational velocity sections.  We use a  simplified dynamic model for WMRs neglecting inductances of motor  armatures and divide our trajectory generation algorithm for  cornering motion into three sections.  We specify a path-deviation  requirement for obstacle avoidance.  Transforming dynamics into  uncorrelated form with regard to translational and rotational  velocities, we make extreme control possible.  By splining rotational section with translational sections and determining the velocity  scale factor, a near-time-optimal trajectory can be obtained.   Simulation results along with inverse control of path-following are  given to validate the generated trajectory.  13 Refs.

Title: Tracking control of unicycle-modeled mobile robots using a saturation feedback controller
Abstract: The tracking control problem with saturation constraint for a class  of unicycle-modeled mobile robots is formulated and solved using the backstepping technique and the idea from the LaSalle's invariance  principle.  A global result is presented in which several constraints on the linear and the angular velocities of the mobile robot from  recent literature are dropped.  The proposed controller can  simultaneously solve both the tracking and regulation problems of a  unicycle-modeled mobile robot.  With the proposed control laws, the  robot can globally follow any path specified by a straight line, a  circle or a path approaching the origin using a single controller.   As demonstrated, the circular and parallel parking control problem  are solved using the proposed controller.  Computer simulations are  presented which confirm the effectiveness of the proposed tracking  control law.  Practical experimental results validate the  simulations.  46 Refs.

Title: GestureMan: A mobile robot that embodies a remote instructor's  actions
Abstract: When designing systems that support remote instruction on physical  tasks, one must consider four requirements: 1) participants should  be able to use non-verbal expressions, 2) they must be able to take  an appropriate body arrangement to see and show gestures, 3) the  instructor should be able to monitor operators and objects, 4) they  must be able to organize the arrangement of bodies and tools and  gestural expression sequentially and interactively.  GestureMan was  developed to satisfy these four requirements by using a mobile robot that embodies a remote instructor's actions.  The mobile robot mounts a camera and a remote control laser pointer on it.  Based on the  experiments with the system we discuss the advantage and  disadvantage of the current implementation.  Also, some implications  to improve the system are described.  22 Refs.

Title: Vision-based active sensor using a flexible beam
Abstract: This paper proposes a new vision-based active sensing system, termed  vision-based active antenna.  This is composed of a camera, a  flexible beam whose force-deformation characteristic is known, and  an actuator for rotating the beam.  The camera observes the beam  deformation, including the contact information, while the beam is in contact with an object.  By solving a set of equations based on the  information acquired through the camera, the sensor can detect the  contact location, the contact force, and the stiffness of the  object, even though the contact point is hidden by occlusion.  For  two particular versions, we show some experimental results to verify the basic idea.  28 Refs.

Title: Using collision avoidance algorithms for designing multi-robot  emergent behaviors
Abstract: We discuss how to induce a set of collective emergent behaviors into  a team of real robots used for soccer robotics.  The activation of  robot behaviors is organized according to a multi-level control  architecture.  The emergent cooperative abilities, like exchanging a  ball, are achieved through the use of efficient collision avoidance  algorithms implemented by a small set of robots able to frequently  swap their roles.  Our algorithms have been tested on a couple of  real robots, Bart and Homer, which played the final game with the  middle size league, at RoboCup'99, in Stockholm.  This approach can  be generalized to allow multi-robot systems to perform various kind  of collective tasks in the entertainment field.  22 Refs.

Title: Development of teleoperated six-legged walking robot for mine  detection and mapping of mine field
Abstract: Now as many as 90 million anti-personnel mines are left buried and  continue to kill or injure many people all over the world.  The Cold  War has already ended.  However, regional wars and conflicts continue to break out one after another and new mines are being buried.  As  one of the world's top-level nations in robotics, Japan should  promote surveys and research to detect and dispose of these  anti-personnel mines for the ultimate good of the environment by  using its advanced robotics technologies.  Our project has developed  and studied high instrumentation technologies for mine detection,  then mine detection and disposal technologies using measuring  equipment mounted on walking robots based on six-legged teleoperated high technology.  8 Refs.

Title: A gradient method for realtime robot control
Abstract: Despite many decades of research into mobile robot control, reliable, high-speed motion in complicated, uncertain environments remains an  unachieved goal.  In this paper we present a solution to realtime  motion control that can competently maneuver a robot at optimal  speed even as it explores a new region or encounters new obstacles.   The method uses a navigation function to generate a gradient field  that represents the optimal (lowest-cost) path to the goal at every  point in the workspace.  Additionally, we present an integrated  sensor fusion system that allows incremental construction of an  unknown or uncertain environment.  Under modest assumptions, the  robot is guaranteed to get to the goal in an arbitrary static  unexplored environment, as long as such a path exists.  We present  preliminary experiments to show that the gradient method is better  than expert human controllers in both known and unknown  environments.  9 Refs.

Title: Braille block detection for autonomous mobile robot navigation
Abstract: A mobile robot can use the walls or the pillars to localize itself  when it navigates in indoor environment.  However, in open space or  outdoor environment there are few easy detectable and stable object  that the robot can use.  In this paper, we propose a method for the  detection of braille blocks, which are originally used for visually  handicapped people, for autonomous mobile robot navigation.  To  recognize the braile block, a CCD camera and a laser fan beam  projector are used as sensor to detect bumps on road surface.  This  paper also presents the experimental results of braille block  following using the sensor system to detect the braille block  position and orientation.  This experiment shows effectiveness of the sensor system for the braille block recognition and implies the  possibility of braille block based mobile robot navigation.  6 Refs.

Title: Human-robot interaction through spoken language dialogue
Abstract: The development of robots able to accept, via a friendly interface,  instructions in terms of the concepts familiar to the human user  remains a challenge.  It is argued that designing and building such  intelligent robots can be seen as the problem of integrating four  main dimensions: human-robot communication, sensory motor skills and perception, decision-making capabilities and learning.  Although  these dimensions have been thoroughly studied in the past, their  integration has seldom been attempted in a systematic way.  It is  further argued that, for the common user, the only sufficiently  practical interface is spoken language.  The "body and soul" of Carl, a robot currently under construction in our lab, are presented.  The  spoken language interface is given particular attention.  30 Refs.
