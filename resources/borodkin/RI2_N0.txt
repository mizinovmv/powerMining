Title: The Oz Programming Model
Abstract: The Oz Programming Model (OPM) is a concurrent programming modelsubsuming higher- order functional and object-oriented programming asfacets of a general model. This is particularly interesting forconcurrent object-oriented programming, for which no comprehensiveformal model existed until now. The model can be extended so that itcan express encapsulated problem solvers generalizing the problemsolving capabilities of constraint logic programming. OPM has beendeveloped together with a concomitant programming language Oz, whichis designed for applications that require complex symboliccomputations, organization into multiple agents, and soft real-timecontrol. An efficient, robust, and interactive implementation of Ozis freely available.

Title: BDI-agents: from theory to practice
Abstract: The study of computational agents capable of rational behaviour hasreceived a great deal of attention in recent years. Theoreticalformalizations of such agents and their implementations haveproceeded in parallel with little or no connection between them. Thispaper explores a particular type of rational agent, aBelief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent. The primary aim of this paper isto integrate (a) the theoretical foundations of BDI agents from botha quantitative decision-theoretic perspective and a symbolicreasoning perspective; (b) the implementations of BDI agents from anideal theoretical perspective and a more practical perspective; and(c) the building of large-scale applications based on BDI agents. Inparticular, an air-traffic management application will be describedfrom both a theoretical and an implementation perspective. 1Introduction The design of systems that are required to performhigh-level management and control tasks in complex dynamicenvironments is becomi...

Abstract: The basic feature of Terminological Knowledge Representation Systemsis to representknowledge by means of taxonomies, here called terminologies, and toprovidea specialized reasoning engine to do inferences on these structures.The taxonomy is built through a representation language calledconcept language(or description logic), which is given well-defined set-theoreticsemantics. The efficiencyof reasoning has often been advocated as a primary motivation for theuseof such systems.Deduction methods and computational properties of reasoning problemsin conceptlanguages are the subject of this paper. The main contributions ofthe paperare: (1) a complexity analysis of concept satisfiability andsubsumption for a wideclass of concept languages; (2) the algorithms for these inferencesthat comply withthe worst-case complexity of the reasoning task they perform.Contents1 Introduction 31.1 Concepts as Structured Set Descriptions : : : : : : : : : : : : :: : : : : : 31.2 ...

Title: Kasbah: An agent marketplace for buying and selling goods
Abstract: While there are many Web services which help users find things tobuy, we know of none which actually try to automate the process ofbuying and selling. Kasbah is a virtual marketplace on the Web whereusers create autonomous agents to buy and sell goods on their behalf.Users specify parameters to guide and constrain an agent's overallbehavior. A simple prototype has been built to test the viability ofthis concept. Introduction Kasbah is a Web-based system where userscreate autonomous agents that buy and sell goods on their behalf. Ouroriginal idea was to reinvent the classified ads. We observed thatthere are many sites on the Web that post ads. Some of these sitesallow users to perform keyword searches on the ads (Seattle Times/PI1996). Some have their ads nicely categorized, making it easier tofind ones of interest (ADWorld 1996). Other sites have more advancedsearching capabilities. For example, Stanford's Infomaster(Infomaster 1995) (Geddis et al. 1995) allows users to ...

Title: Markov Games as a Framework for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Abstract: In the Markov decision process (MDP) formalizationof reinforcement learning, a single adaptiveagent interacts with an environment defined by aprobabilistic transition function. In this solipsisticview, secondary agents can only be part of theenvironment and are therefore fixed in their behavior.The framework of Markov games allowsus to widen this view to include multiple adaptiveagents with interacting or competing goals.This paper considers a step in this direction inwhich exactly two agents with diametrically opposedgoals share an environment. It describesa Q-learning-like algorithm for finding optimalpolicies and demonstrates its application to a simpletwo-player game in which the optimal policyis probabilistic.1 INTRODUCTIONNo agent lives in a vacuum; it must interact with other agentsto achieve its goals. Reinforcement learning is a promisingtechnique for creating agents that co-exist [Tan, 1993,Yanco and Stein, 1993] , but the mathematical frameworkthat just...

Title: Collaborative Plans for Complex Group Action
Abstract: The original formulation of SharedPlans (Grosz and Sidner, 1990a) wasdeveloped to providea model of collaborative planning in which it was not necessary forone agent to have intentions-totoward an act of a different agent. Unlike other contemporaneousapproaches (Searle, 1990), thisformulation provided for two agents to coordinate their activitieswithout introducing any notionof irreducible joint intentions. However, it only treated activitiesthat directly decomposed intosingle-agent actions, did not address the need for agents to committo their joint activity, and didnot adequately deal with agents having only partial knowledge of theway in which to performan action. This paper provides a revised and expanded version ofSharedPlans that addressesthese shortcomings. It also reformulates Pollack's definition ofindividual plans (Pollack, 1990)to handle cases in which a single agent has only partial knowledge;this reformulation mesheswith the definition of SharedPlans.

Title: Controlling Cooperative Problem Solving in Industrial Multi-Agent Systems Using Joint Intentions
Abstract: One reason why Distributed AI (DAI) technology has been deployed inrelatively few real-size applicationsis that it lacks a clear and implementable model of cooperativeproblem solving which specifieshow agents should operate and interact in complex, dynamic andunpredictable environments. Asa consequence of the experience gained whilst building a number ofDAI systems for industrial applications,a new principled model of cooperation has been developed. This model,called Joint Responsibility,has the notion of joint intentions at its core. It specifiespre-conditions which must be attainedbefore collaboration can commence and prescribes how individualsshould behave both when jointactivity is progressing satisfactorily and also when it runs intodifficulty. The theoretical model hasbeen used to guide the implementation of a general-purposecooperation framework and the qualitativeand quantitative benefits of this implementation have been assessedthrough a series of comparativ...

Title: Commitments and Conventions: The Foundation of Coordination in Multi-Agent Systems
Abstract: Distributed Artificial Intelligence systems, in which multiple agentsinteract to improve theirindividual performance and to enhance the system's overall utility,are becoming an increasinglypervasive means of conceptualising a diverse range of applications.As the discipline matures,researchers are beginning to strive for the underlying theories andprinciples which guide thecentral processes of coordination and cooperation. Here agentcommunities are modelled using adistributed goal search formalism and it is argued that commitments(pledges to undertake aspecified course of action) and conventions (means of monitoringcommitments in changingcircumstances) are the foundation of coordination in multi-agentsystems. An analysis of existingcoordination models which use concepts akin to commitments andconventions is undertakenbefore a new unifying framework is presented. Finally a number ofprominent coordinationtechniques which do not explicitly involve commitments or convent...

Title: Towards Flexible Teamwork
Abstract: Many AI researchers are today striving to build agent teams forcomplex, dynamicmulti-agent domains, with intended applications in arenas such aseducation, training,entertainment, information integration, and collective robotics.Unfortunately, uncertaintiesin these complex, dynamic domains obstruct coherent teamwork. Inparticular, teammembers often encounter differing, incomplete, and possiblyinconsistent views of their environment.Furthermore, team members can unexpectedly fail in fulfillingresponsibilitiesor discover unexpected opportunities. Highly flexible coordinationand communication iskey in addressing such uncertainties. Simply fitting individualagents with precomputedcoordination plans will not do, for their inflexibility can causesevere failures in teamwork,and their domain-specificity hinders reusability.Our central hypothesis is that the key to such flexibility andreusability is providingagents with general models of teamwork.

Title: Cool: A language for describing coordination in multiagent systems
Abstract: Agent interaction takes place at several levels. Current work in theARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort has addressed the informationcontent level by the KIF language and the intentional level by theKQML language. In this paper we address the coordination level bymeans of our Coordination Language (COOL) that relies on speechact based communication, but integrates it in a structuredconversationframework that captures the coordination mechanisms agentsuse when working together. We are currently using this language (i)to represent coordination mechanisms for the supply chain ofmanufacturingenterprises modeled as intelligent agents and (ii) as anenvironment for designing and validating coordination protocolsfor multi-agent systems. This paper describes the basic elements ofthis language: conversation objects, conversation rules, errorrecoveryrules, continuation rules, conversation nesting.

Title: Communicative Actions for Artificial Agents
Abstract: This paper considers the semantics of the agent communicationlanguage KQML. By using this languagefor communication, agents will be able to requestand provide services. Indeed, numerous projects haveshown how the language can profitably support interoperationamong distributed agents. However, beforebecoming a widely-accepted standard, it would beworthwhile to examine the language in detail, especiallythe semantical issues it raises. This paper identifiesnumerous difficulties with the language, and anattempt is made to point to their resolution. The paperillustrates the kind of semantics we believe to be necessaryto characterize agent communication languages,identifies an important adequacy condition (compositionality)and shows how to compose a question froma request and an inform. Finally, the paper discussespossible impacts to be felt on various KQML decisionsfrom the semantical issues raised here.Keywords: Agent Communication Languages,KQML, speech actsIntroduct...

Title: Software Agents: An Overview
Abstract: Agent software is a rapidly developing area of research. However, theoveruse of the word `agent' has tended to mask the fact that, inreality, there is a truly heterogeneous body of research beingcarried out under this banner. This overview paper presents atypology of agents. Next, it places agents in context, defines themand then goes on, inter alia, to overview critically the rationales,hypotheses, goals, challenges and state-of-the-art demonstrators ofthe various agent types in our typology. Hence, it attempts to makeexplicit much of what is usually implicit in the agents literature.It also proceeds to overview some other general issues which pertainto all the types of agents in the typology. This paper largelyreviews software agents, and it also contains some strong opinionsthat are not necessarily widely accepted by the agent community. 2 1Introduction The main goal of this paper is to overview the rapidlyevolving area of software agents.

Abstract: Many researchers have shown that there is no single best organizationor coordination mechanism for all environments. This paper discussesthe design and implementation of an extendable family of coordinationmechanisms, called Generalized Partial Global Planning (GPGP). Theset of coordination mechanisms described here assists in schedulingactivities for teams of cooperative computational agents. The GPGPapproach has several unique features. First, it is not tied to asingle domain. Each mechanism is defined as a response to certainfeatures in the current task environment. We show that differentcombinations of mechanisms are appropriate for different taskenvironments. Secondly, the approach works in conjunction with anagent's existing local planner/scheduler. Finally, the initial set offive mechanisms presented here generalizes and extends the PartialGlobal Planning (PGP) algorithm. In comparison to PGP, GPGP schedulestasks with deadlines, it allows agent heterogeneity, it ex...

Title: Learning to Coordinate without Sharing Information
Abstract: Researchers in the field of Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI)have been developing efficient mechanisms to coordinate theactivities of multiple autonomous agents. The need for coordinationarises because agents have to share resources and expertise requiredto achieve their goals. Previous work in the area includes usingsophisticated information exchange protocols, investigatingheuristics for negotiation, and developing formal models ofpossibilities of conflict and cooperation among agent interests. Inorder to handle the changing requirements of continuous and dynamicenvironments, we propose learning as a means to provide additionalpossibilities for effective coordination. We use reinforcementlearning techniques on a block pushing problem to show that agentscan learn complimentary policies to follow a desired path without anyknowledge about each other. We theoretically analyze andexperimentally verify the effects of learning rate on systemconvergence, and demonstrat...

Title: Communication in Reactive Multiagent Robotic Systems
Abstract: Multiple cooperating robots are able to complete many tasks morequickly and reliably than one robot alone. Communication between therobots can multiply their capabilities and effectiveness, but to whatextent? In this research, the importance of communication in roboticsocieties is investigated through experiments on both simulated andreal robots. Performance was measured for three different types ofcommunication for three different tasks. The levels of communicationare progressively more complex and potentially more expensive toimplement. For some tasks, communication can significantly improveperformance, but for others inter-agent communication is apparentlyunnecessary. In cases where communication helps, the lowest level ofcommunication is almost as effective as the more complex type. Thebulk of these results are derived from thousands of simulations runwith randomly generated initial conditions. The simulation resultshelp determine appropriate parameters for the reac...

Title: Multiagent Systems: A Survey from a Machine Learning Perspective
Abstract: Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) has existed as a subfieldof AI for less than two decades. DAI is concerned with systems thatconsist of multiple independent entities that interact in a domain.Traditionally, DAI has been divided into two sub-disciplines:Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) focusses on the informationmanagement aspects of systems with several branches working togethertowards a common goal; Multiagent Systems (MAS) deals with behaviormanagement in collections of several independent entities, or agents.This survey of MAS is intended to serve as an introduction to thefield and as an organizational framework. A series of increasinglycomplex general multiagent scenarios are presented. For eachscenario, the issues that arise are described along with a samplingof the techniques that exist to deal with them. The presentedtechniques are not exhaustive, but they highlight how multiagentsystems can be and have been used to build complex systems. Whenoptions exi...

Title: Cooperative Information Gathering: A Distributed Problem Solving Approach
Abstract: We contrast two approaches to the problem of information gatheringthat may be characterized as distributed processing and distributedproblem solving. The former is characteristic of most existinginformation gathering systems, while the latter is central toresearch in multi-agent systems. We examine features of complexinformation carrying environments and the information gathering taskthat demonstrate both the utility of viewing information gathering asdistributed problem solving and difficulties with viewing it asdistributed processing.

Title: The Open Agent Architecture: a framework for building distributed software systems
Abstract: The Open Agent Architecture (OAA), developed and used for severalyears at SRI International, makes it possible for software servicesto be provided through the cooperative efforts of distributedcollections of autonomous agents. Communication and cooperationbetween agents are brokered by one or more facilitators, which areresponsible for matching requests, from users and agents, withdescriptions of the capabilities of other agents. Thus, it is notgenerally required that a user or agent know the identities,locations, or number of other agents involved in satisfying arequest. OAA is structured so as to minimize the effort involved increating new agents and "wrapping" legacy applications,written in various languages and operating on various platforms; toencourage the reuse of existing agents; and to allow for dynamism andflexibility in the makeup of agent communities. Distinguishingfeatures of OAA as compared with related work include extremeflexibility in using facilitator-b...

Title: Market-Oriented Programming: Some Early Lessons
Abstract: As the other chapters in this volume attest, the market-basedapproach offers a useful way to conceptualize and analyze distributedcontrol problems, as well as to design and implement actualdistributed control systems. For the past few years, I have beenexploring this approach not only as a methodology for solvingparticular distributed control problems, but also as a genericprogramming paradigm for the development of distributed systems basedon these methods. By a programming paradigm, I mean that the exerciseof defining a computational market leads to the specification of aprocedural solution to the underlying allocation problem facing thatmarket. I call this approach "market-oriented programming".

Title: A methodology for agent-oriented analysis and design
Abstract: This paper presents a methodology for agent-oriented analysis anddesign. The methodology is general, in that it is applicable to awide range of multi-agent systems, and comprehensive, in that itdeals with both the macro-level (societal) and the micro-level(agent) aspects of systems. The methodology is founded on the view ofa system as a computational organisation consisting of variousinteracting roles. We illustrate the methodology through a case study(an agent-based business process management system).

Title: Coordination Techniques for Distributed Artificial Intelligence
Abstract: Coordination, the process by which an agent reasons about its localactions and the (anticipated)actions of others to try and ensure the community acts in a coherentmanner, is perhaps the keyproblem of the discipline of Distributed Artificial Intelligence(DAI). In order to make advances itis important that the theories and principles which guide thiscentral activity are uncovered andanalysed in a systematic and rigourous manner. To this end, thispaper models agent communitiesusing a distributed goal search formalism, and argues thatcommitments (pledges to undertake aspecific course of action) and conventions (means of monitoringcommitments in changingcircumstances) are the foundation of coordination in all DAI systems.1.

Title: Subsumption between Queries to Object-Oriented Databases
Abstract: Most work on query optimization in relational and object-orienteddatabaseshas concentrated on tuning algebraic expressions and the physicalaccess tothe database contents. The attention to semantic query optimization,however,has been restricted due to its inherent complexity. We take a secondlookat semantic query optimization in object-oriented databases and findthatreasoning techniques for concept languages developed in ArtificialIntelligenceapply to this problem because concept languages have been tailoredfor efficiencyand their semantics is compatible with class and query definitions inobject-oriented databases. We propose a query optimizer thatrecognizes subsetrelationships between a query and a view (a simpler query whoseansweris stored) in polynomial time.Contents1 Introduction 32 Object-Oriented Databases and Queries 52.1 Defining an OODB Schema : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : :: : 62.2 Query Classes : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : :...

Title: The Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problem: Formalization and Algorithms
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a formalism called a distributed constraintsatisfaction problem (distributed CSP) andalgorithms for solving distributed CSPs. A distributed CSP is aconstraint satisfaction problem in which variables and constraintsaredistributed among multiple agents. Various application problems inDistributed Artificial Intelligence can be formalized as distributedCSPs. We present our newly developed technique called asynchronousbacktracking that allows agents to act asynchronously andconcurrently without any global control, while guaranteeing thecompleteness of the algorithm. Furthermore, we describe how theasynchronous backtracking algorithm can be modified into a moreefficient algorithm called an asynchronous weak-commitmentsearch, which can revise a bad decision without exhaustive search bychanging the priority order of agents dynamically. Theexperimental results on various example problems show that theasynchronous weak-commitment search algorithm ...

Title: Learning to behave socially
Abstract: Our previous work introduced a methodology for synthesizing andanalyzing basic behaviors which served as a substrate for generatinga large repertoire of higher-level group interactions (Mataric 1992,Mataric 1993). In this paper we describe how, given the substrate,agents can learn to behave socially, i.e. to maximize averageindividual benefit by maximizing collective benefit. While this is awell-defined problem for rational agents, it is difficult to learn insituated domains. We describe three sources of reinforcement and showtheir necessity for learning non-greedy social rules. The learningstrategy is demonstrated on a group of physical mobile robotslearning to yield and share information in a foraging task.

Our work extends previous workby Littman on zero-sum stochastic games to a broader framework. Wedesign a multiagent Q-learning method under this framework, and provethat it converges to a Nash equilibrium under specified conditions.This algorithm is useful for finding the optimal strategy when thereexists a unique Nash equilibrium in the game. When there existmultiple Nash equilibria in the game, this algorithm should becombined with other learning techniques to find optimal strategies. 1Introduction Reinforcement learning has gained attention andextensive study in recent years [5, 12]. As a learning method thatdoes not need a model of its environment and can be used online,reinforcement learning is wellsuited for multiagent systems, whereagents know little about other agents, and the environment changesduring learning.

We propose a strategic model of negotiationthat takesthe passage of time during the negotiation process itself intoaccount. A distributednegotiation mechanism is introduced that is simple, efficient,stable, and flexible invarious situations. The model considers situations characterized bycomplete as wellas incomplete information, and ones in which some agents lose overtime while othersgain over time.

Title: Advantages of a Leveled Commitment Contracting Protocol
Abstract: In automated negotiation systems consisting of self-interestedagents, contracts have traditionally been binding. Such contracts donot allow agents to efficiently accommodate future events. Gametheory has proposed contingency contracts to solve this problem.Among computational agents, contingency contracts are oftenimpractical due to large numbers of interdependent and unanticipatedfuture events to be conditioned on, and because some events are notmutually observable. This paper proposes a leveled commitmentcontracting protocol that allows self-interested agents toefficiently accommodate future events by having the possibility ofunilaterally decommitting from a contract based on local reasoning. Adecommitment penalty is assigned to both agents in a contract: to befreed from the obligations of the contract, an agent only pays thispenalty to the other party. It is shown through formal analysis ofmultiple contracting settings that this leveled commitment feature ina contract...

Title: Foundations of a Logical Approach to Agent Programming
Abstract: This paper describes a novel approach to high-level agent programmingbased on a highly developed logical theory of action. The userprovides a specification of the agents' basic actions (preconditionsand effects) as well as of relevant aspects of the environment, in anextended version of the situation calculus. He can then specifybehaviors for the agents in terms of these actions in a programminglanguage where one can refer to conditions in effect in theenvironment. When an implementation of the basic actions is provided,the programs can be executed in a real environment; otherwise, asimulated execution is still possible. The interpreter automaticallymaintains the world model required to execute programs based on thespecification. The theoretical framework includes a solution to theframe problem, allows agents to have incomplete knowledge of theirenvironment, and handles perceptual actions. The theory can also beused to prove programs correct. A simple meeting scheduling a...

Title: A Social Reasoning Mechanism Based On Dependence Networks
Abstract: . This paper describes the fundamental conceptsof a social reasoning mechanism, designed to be part of anagent's internal model, in a multi-agent systems (MAS) context.It enables an agent to reason about the others using informationabout their goals, actions, resources and plans. Everyagent stores this information in a data structure called externaldescription. We have formally defined and implementedthe concepts of external description, dependence relation, anddependence network. One of the main contributions of thiswork is that an agent can infer his dependence on others usingeither his own plans or those of the others. As a result,we have defined a preliminary taxonomy of dependence situations regarding the goal being analysed (unilateral, mutual orreciprocal) and the sets of plans used in this reasoning mechanism(mutually or locally believed). We have used this modelto build a dependence network simulator, called DEPNET,which is also briefly described in this paper...

Title: Terminological Logics with Modal Operators
Abstract: Terminological knowledge representation formalisms can be used torepresent objective, time-independent facts about an applicationdomain. Notions like belief, intentions, time -- which are essentialfor the representation of multi-agent environments -- can only beexpressed in a very limited way. For such notions, modal logics withpossible worlds semantics provides a formally well-founded andwell-investigated basis. This paper presents a framework forintegrating modal operators into terminological knowledgerepresentation languages. These operators can be used both inside ofconcept expressions and in front of terminological and assertionalaxioms. The main restrictions are that all modal operators areinterpreted in the basic logic K, and that we consider increasingdomains instead of constant domains. We introduce syntax andsemantics of the extended language, and show that satisfiability offinite sets of formulas is decidable.

Inthis paper we lay the foundations for a principled theory of agencyand autonomy, and specify the relationship between them.

We examine some of the factors that can influence thedynamics of the learning process in such a setting. We firstdistinguish reinforcement learners that are unaware of (or ignore)the presence of other agents from those that explicitly attempt tolearn the value of joint actions and the strategies of theircounterparts.

We thenpropose alternative optimistic exploration strategies that increasethe likelihood of convergence to an optimal equilibrium. 1Introduction The application of learning to the problem ofcoordination in multiagent systems (MASs) has become increasinglypopular in AI and game theory. ...

Theseagents are unaware of the capabilities of other agents andmay or may not be cognizant of goals to achieve.

We firstdefine a precise framework in which to study adaptive load balancing,important features of which are its stochastic nature and the purelylocal information available to individual agents. Given thisframework, we show illuminating results on the interplay betweenbasic adaptive behavior parameters and their effect on systemefficiency. We then investigate the properties of adaptive loadbalancing in heterogeneous populations, and address the issue ofexploration vs. exploitation in that context.

Title: Equilibrium Analysis of the Possibilities of Unenforced Exchange in Multiagent Systems
Abstract: In multiagent systems, interaction protocols areusually enforced by law. Enforcement is problematicamong computational agents, becausethey may operate under incomplete or differentlaws, the laws may not be uniformly enforced,and the agents can vanish easily. This paperpresents an enforcement free method for carryingout exchanges so that both agents aremotivated to abide to their contract. This isachieved by splitting the exchanged goods intopartial exchanges so that at each step, bothagents benefit more from the future of the exchangethan from vanishing with the goods orpayment. The conditions for such exchangeare presented in general, and the maximumdeliveries and payments---for any point in theexchange---are solved for. Similar analysis iscarried out for the case, where the agents'current actions affect their future contracts.Strategic delaying is also discussed.

Title: The Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problem: Formalization and Algorithms
Abstract: A distributed constraint satisfaction problem can formalizevarious application problems in MAS, and several algorithmsfor solving this problem have been developed. Onelimitation of these algorithms is that they assume each agenthas only one local variable. Although simple modificationsenable these algorithms to handle multiple local variables,obtained algorithms are neither efficient nor scalableto larger problems.We develop a new algorithm that can handle multiple localvariables efficiently, which is based on the asynchronousweak-commitment search algorithm. In this algorithm, abad local solution can be modified without forcing otheragents to exhaustively search local problems. Also, the numberof interactions among agents can be decreased sinceagents communicate only when they find local solutions thatsatisfy all of the local constraints. Experimental evaluationsshow that this algorithm is far more efficient than an algorithmthat uses the prioritization among agents.1

Title: Representing and executing agent-based systems
Abstract: In this paper we describe an approach to the representation andimplementationof agent-based systems where the behaviour of an individual agent isrepresented by a set of logical rules in a particular form. This notonly provides alogical specification of the agent, but also allows us to directlyexecute the rules inorder to implement the agent's behaviour. Agents communicate witheach otherthrough a simple, and logically well-founded, broadcast communicationmechanism.

Title: Diagnosis as an Integral Part of Multi-Agent Adaptability TITLE2:
Abstract: Agents working under real world conditions may face an environmentcapable of changing rapidly from one moment to the next, eitherthrough perceived faults, unexpected interactions or adversarialintrusions. To gracefully and efficiently handle such situations, themembers of a multi-agent system must be able to adapt, either byevolving internal structures and behavior or repairing or isolatingthose external influenced believed to be malfunctioning. The firststep in achieving adaptability is diagnosis - being able toaccurately detect and determine the cause of a fault based on itssymptoms. In this paper we examine how domain independent diagnosisplays a role in multi-agent systems, including the informationrequired to support and produce diagnoses. Particular attention ispaid to coordination based diagnosis directed by a causal model.Several examples are described in the context of an Intelligent Homeenvironment, and the issue of diagnostic sensitivity versusefficiency is ad...

Abstract: New reactive behaviors that implement formations inmulti-robot teams are presented and evaluated. Thesemotor schemas, or primitive behaviors, for relativepositional maintenance are integrated with existingnavigational behaviors to help robots complete navigationaltasks while in formation. Four formations,based on existing military doctrine (Army 1986), andthree methods for determining correct vehicle positionare investigated.

Title: Flexible Social Laws
Abstract: Although communication is generally considered to dominate overprocessing cost in distributed systems, the problem of communicationcost in multiagent planning has not been sufficiently addressed. Onemethod for reducing both communication cost and planning time is theuse of social laws. Social laws, however, can be too restrictive,limiting soundness. Flexible social laws can enable multiagentsystems to reap the benefits of reduced communication cost andplanning time (except in the worst case), without limiting soundness(although optimality may be degraded). By analyzing the performance,we show that this model can make multiagent planning exponentiallymore efficient without limiting its applicability. 1 Introduction Asautomation of intelligent tasks increases, the need will arise forheterogeneous agents working in a common environment. As a result,agents will need to plan and coordinate plans in real time. [ Cook,1994 ] has described three methods of handling multiple age...

Title: Towards a formal theory of communication for multi-agent systems
Abstract: Agents in multiagent systems interact to a large extent bycommunicating. Such communication may be fruitfully studied from thepoint of view of speech act theory. In order for multiagent systemsto be formally and rigorously designed and analyzed, a semantics ofspeech acts that gives their objective model-theoretic conditions ofsatisfaction is needed. However, most research into multiagentsystems that deals with communication provides only informaldescriptions of the different message types used. And this problem isnot addressed at all by traditional speech act theory or by AIresearch into discourse understanding. I provide a formal semanticsfor the major kinds of speech acts at a level that has not beenconsidered before. The resulting theory applies uniformly to a widerange of multiagent systems. Some applications of this theory areoutlined, and some of its theorems listed. 1 Introduction Multiagentsystems are ubiquitous in Artificial Intelligence. Even in thesimplest s...

Title: Layered Learning in Multiagent Systems
Abstract: In the past few years, Multiagent Systems (MAS) has emerged as anactive subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Because of theinherent complexity of MAS, there is much interest in using MachineLearning (ML) techniques to help build multiagent systems. Roboticsoccer is a particularly good domain for studying MAS and MultiagentLearning. Our approach to using ML as a tool for building SoccerServer clients involves layering increasingly complex learnedbehaviors. In this article, we describe two levels of learnedbehaviors. First, the clients learn a low-level individual skill thatallows them to control the ball effectively. Then, using this learnedskill, they learn a higher-level skill that involves multipleplayers. For both skills, we describe the learning method in detailand report on our extensive empirical testing. We also verifyempirically that the learned skills are applicable to gamesituations.

Title: Towards a Social Level Characterisation of Socially Responsible Agents
Abstract: This paper presents a high-level framework for analysing anddesigning intelligentagents. The framework's key abstraction mechanism is a new computerlevel called theSocial Level. The Social Level sits immediately above the KnowledgeLevel, as definedby Allen Newell, and is concerned with the inherently social aspectsof multiple agentsystems. To illustrate the working of this framework, an importantnew class of agent isidentified and then specified. Socially responsible agents retaintheir local autonomy butstill draw from, and provide resources to, the larger community.Through empirical evaluation,it is shown that such agents produce both good system-wideperformance andgood individual performance.1.

Aknowledge-based program is asyntactic object: a program with tests for knowledge. The secondnotion is that of acontext, which captures the setting in which a program is to beexecuted. In a given context,a standard program (one without tests for knowledge) is representedby (i.e., correspondsin a precise sense to) a unique system. A knowledge-based program, onthe other hand,may be represented by no system, one system, or many systems. In thispaper, we providea sufficient condition for a knowledge-based program to berepresented in a unique way ina given context. This condit...

Title: Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Abstract: . In this paper, we investigate the use of hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) to speed up the acquisition of cooperative multi-agent tasks. We introduce a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework, and propose a hierarchical multi-agent RL algorithm called Cooperative HRL. In this framework, agents are cooperative and homogeneous (use the same task decomposition). Learning is decentralized, with each agent learning three interrelated skills: how to perform each individual subtask, the order in which to carry them out, and how to coordinate with other agents. We define cooperative subtasks to be those subtasks in which coordination among agents significantly improves the performance of the overall task. Those levels of the hierarchy which include cooperative subtasks are called cooperation levels. A fundamental property of the proposed approach is that it allows agents to learn coordination faster by sharing information at the level of cooperative subtasks, rather than attempting to learn coordination at the level of primitive actions. We study the empirical performance of the Cooperative HRL algorithm using two testbeds: a simulated two-robot trash collection task, and a

Title: Poutre. An Overview of Cooperative and Competitive Multiagent Learning
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MASs) is an area of distributed artificial intelligence that emphasizes the joint behaviors of agents with some degree of autonomy and the complexities arising from their interactions. The research on MASs is intensifying, as supported by a growing number of conferences, workshops, and journal papers. In this survey we give an overview of multi-agent learning research in a spectrum of areas, including reinforcement learning, evolutionary computation, game theory, complex systems, agent modeling, and robotics. MASs range in their description from cooperative to being competitive in nature. To muddle the waters, competitive systems can show apparent cooperative behavior, and vice versa. In practice, agents can show a wide range of behaviors in a system, that may either fit the label of cooperative or competitive, depending on the circumstances. In this survey, we discuss current work on cooperative and competitive MASs and aim to make the distinctions and overlap between the two approaches more explicit. Lastly, this paper summarizes the papers of the first International workshop on Learning and Adaptation in MAS (LAMAS) hosted at the fourth International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi Agent Systems (AAMAS05) and places the work in the above survey.

Title: Some comments on history based structures
Abstract: . History based models, introduced by Parikh and Ramanujam, provide a natural mathematical model of social interactive situations. These models offer a low level  description of a social situation  describing the situation in terms of events, sequences of events, and the agents  view of these events. A multi-agent epistemic temporal modal logic can be used to reason about these structures. A number of other models have been proposed in the literature which can be used as a semantics for such a logical language. Most notably, the interpreted systems discussed by Fagin et al. In this paper, we will discuss the differences and similarities between these two mathematical models. In particular, it is shown that these two semantics are modally equivalent. We will conclude with a discussion of a number of questions that are raised when history based models are used to reason about game-theoretic situations. 1

Abstract: I, Franco Raimondi, confirm that the work presented in this thesis is my own.

In this sense, MAS have been employed successfully as a modelling paradigm in a number of scenarios, especially in Computer Science. However, the process of modelling complex and heterogeneous systems is intrinsically prone to errors: for this reason, computer scientists are typically concerned with the issue of verifying that a system actually behaves as it is supposed to, especially when a system is complex. Techniques have been developed to perform this task: testing is the most common technique, but in many circumstances a formal proof of correctness is needed. Techniques for formal verification include theorem proving and model checking. Model checking techniques, in particular, have been successfully employed in the formal verification of

Abstract: Summary. Agent technology is widely perceived to be a viable solution for largescale industrial and commercial applications in dynamic environments such as the Internet. However, the lack of rigour and language support in the analysis, specification, design and implementation of multi-agent systems has hampered the wide adoption of agent technology. This paper proposes a model-driven approach to the development of multi-agent systems. It combines graphic modelling with formal specification through automated tools. The paper reports an agent-oriented modelling language CAMLE and the automated tools in its modelling environment. Two aspects of particular importance in the model-driven development methodology are addressed in this paper. The first is the definition and implementation of consistency constraints on graphic models. The second is the automated transformation of graphic models into formal specifications. 1

Title: On fault tolerance in law-governed multi-agent systems
Abstract: . The dependability of open multi-agent systems is a particular concern, notably because of their main characteristics as decentralization and no single point of control. This paper describes an approach to increase the availability of such systems through a technique of fault tolerance known as agent replication, and to increase their reliability through a mechanism of agent interaction regulation called law enforcement mechanism. Therefore, we combine two frameworks: one for law enforcement, named XMLaw, and another for agent adaptive replication, named DimaX, in which the decision of replicating an agent is based on a dynamic estimation of its criticality. Moreover, we will describe how we can reuse some of the information expressed by laws in order to help at the estimation of agent criticality, thus providing a better integration of the two frameworks. At the end of the paper, we recommend a means to specify criticality monitoring variation through a structured argumentation approach that documents the rationale around the decisions of the law elements derivation.

Title: Title Argumentation Based Decision Making for Trust in Multi-Agent Systems
Abstract: Agents in Multi-Agent Systems depend on assistance from others to attain their goals. Often, goals of agents conflict with each other, and agents can be unreliable or deceitful. Therefore, rational agents embedded in an open Multi-Agent System need to be equipped with algorithms to reason about trust. Currently, existing algorithms mainly focus on performance of these algorithms in terms of utility, but do not provide explanation of their actions. This might hinder acceptance of agent-based technologies in sensitive applications where users rely on their personal agents. In this thesis, we therefore propose a new approach to trust in Multi-Agent Systems based on argumentation that aims to expose the rationale behind these decisions. Our solution features a clear separation of opponent modeling and decision making. It uses fuzzy logic to model behavior of opponents, and argumentation to translate these models into wellsupported decisions. v

Title: The Role of Dynamic-Network Multi-Agent Models of Socio-Political Systems in Policy 1
Abstract: Researchers and policy makers are increasingly turning to multi-agent and dynamic-network multi-agent models to study real-world systems. The models hold particular appeal because of their intuitive representation of complex real-world systems that can be thought of as complex systems.  Both policy makers and those affected by the policies influenced by these models often question whether a model is valid. We explore the intended use of these models, the extent to which they can be validated, and the consequent implications for their use in setting policy. We ground the analysis using a dynamic-network multi-agent model we are helping to develop called the Regional Threat Evaluator (RTE), applied to data from Indonesia and Thailand. We find that there are three core difficulties in validating these models: defining the appropriate operating domain, data availability, and validating a model that integrates multiple theories.

Title: Multi-Agent Shared Hierarchy Reinforcement Learning
Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning facilitates faster learning by structuring the policy space, encouraging reuse of subtasks in different contexts, and enabling more effective state abstraction. In this paper, we explore another source of power of hierarchies, namely facilitating sharing of subtask value functions across multiple agents. We show that, when combined with suitable coordination information, this approach can significantly speed up learning and make it more scalable with the number of agents. We introduce the multi-agent shared hierarchy (MASH) framework, which generalizes the MAXQ framework and allows selectively sharing subtask value functions across agents. We develop a modelbased average-reward reinforcement learning algorithm for the MASH framework and show its effectiveness with empirical results in a multiagent taxi domain. 1.

Title: A reinforcement learning scheme for a partially-observable multi-agent game
Abstract: . We formulate an automatic strategy acquisition problem for the multi-agent card game Hearts  as a reinforcement learning problem. The problem can approximately be dealt with in the framework of a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) for a singleagent system. Hearts is an example of imperfect information games, which are more difficult to deal with than perfect information games. A POMDP is a decision problem that includes a process for estimating unobservable state variables. By regarding missing information as unobservable state variables, an imperfect information game can be formulated as a POMDP. However, the game of Hearts is a realistic problem that has a huge number of possible states, even when it is approximated as a single-agent system. Therefore, further approximation is necessary to make the strategy acquisition problem tractable. This article presents an approximation method based on estimating unobservable state variables and predicting the actions of the other agents. Simulation results show that our reinforcement learning method is applicable to such a difficult multi-agent problem.

Abstract: Studying the design and implementation of a number of computer hasled to some general hints for system design. They are described hereand illustrated by many examples, ranging from hardware such as theAlto and the Dorado to application programs such as Bravo and Star.1. Introduction Designing a computer system is very different fromdesigning an algorithm: The external interface (that is, therequirement) is less precisely defined, more complex, and moresubject to change.

Title: An Implementation of the Hamlyn Sender-Managed Interface Architecture
Abstract: IntroductionProcessors are rapidly getting faster, and message-passingmulticomputer interconnections are doing the same,thanks to recent developments in Gb/s links and lowlatencypacket switches. But the cost of passing messagesbetween applications also includes the overhead ofcrossing interfaces between the operating system (OS), adevice driver, and the hardware, which can be orders ofmagnitude more than the cost of moving a message's bitsacross the wires.Hamlyn is an architecture for processor-interconnectioninterfaces that addresses this difficulty. It achieves bothlow latency and high bandwidth, isolates applicationsfrom each other's mistakes, and supplies a rich set ofmessage-delivery semantics. It does so by exploitingseveral techniques:. Sender-based memory management. Senders, notreceivers, choose the destination memory address atwhich messages are deposited. This means thatmessages are sent only when the sender knows th

Title: Real Time Groupware as a Distributed System: Concurrency Control and Its Effect on the Interface
Abstract: This paper exposes the concurrency control problem ingroupware when it is implemented as a distributed system.Traditional concurrency control methods cannot be applieddirectly to groupware because system interactions includespeople as well as computers. Methods, such as locking,serialization, and their degree of optimism, are shown tohave quite different impacts on the interface and howoperations are displayed and perceived by group members.The paper considers both human and technicalconsiderations that designers should ponder before choosinga particular concurrency control method. It also reviews ourwork-in-progress designing and implementing a library ofconcurrency schemes in GROUPKIT, a groupware toolkit.KEYWORDS: Real time groupware, computer supportedcooperative work, distributed systems, concurrency controlalgorithms.INTRODUCTIONReal time distributed groupware allows two or moregeographically-separated people to work together at thesame time through a comput...

Title: Constraint Hierarchies and Logic Programming
Abstract: Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) is a general scheme for extendinglogic programming to include constraints. It is parameterized by D,the domain of the constraints. However, CLP(D) languages, as well asmost other constraint systems, only allow the programmer to specifyconstraints that must hold. In many applications, such as interactivegraphics, page layout, and decision support, one needs to expresspreferences as well as strict requirements. If we wish to make fulluse of the constraint paradigm, we need ways to represent thesedefaults and preferences declaratively, as constraints, rather thanencoding them in the procedural parts of the language. We describe ascheme for extending CLP(D) to include both required and preferentialconstraints, with an arbitrary number of strengths of preference. Wepresent some of the theory of such languages, and an algorithm forexecuting them. To test our ideas, we have implemented an interpreterfor an instance of this language scheme with D equal to the reals. Wedescribe our interpreter, and outline some examples of using thislanguage.

Abstract: Ethernet, a 10 Mbit/sec CSMA/CD network, is one of the mostsuccessfulLAN technologies. Considerable confusion exists as to the actualcapacity ofan Ethernet, especially since some theoretical studies have examinedoperatingregimes that are not characteristic of actual networks. Based onmeasurements of an actual implementation, we show that for a wideclass ofapplications, Ethernet is capable of carrying its nominal bandwidthof usefultraffic, and allocates the bandwidth fairly. We discuss howimplementationscan achieve this performance, describe some problems that have ariseninexisting implementations, and suggest ways to avoid future problems.This paper was originally published in Proceedings of the SIGCOMM '88Symposium onCommunications Architectures and Protocols, ACM SIGCOMM, Stanford,California, August1988.Copyright  1988 Association for Computing MachineryPermission to copy without fee all or part of this material isgranted provided that the copiesare not made ...

Further, there are no toolkits for building3D user interfaces. We present a system which allows experimentationwith 3D widgets, encapsulated 3D geometry and behavior. Ourwidgets are first-class objects in the same 3D environment used todevelop the application. This integration of widgets and applicationobjects provides a higher bandwidth between interface and applicationthan exists in more traditional UI toolkit-based interfaces.

Abstract: We believe that navigation in information spaces is bestsupported by tapping into our natural spatial and geographicways of thinking. To this end, we are developinga new computer interface model called Pad.The ongoing Pad project uses a spatial metaphorfor computer interface design. It provides an intuitivebase for the support of such applications as electronicmarketplaces, information services, and on-line collaboration.Pad is an infinite two dimensional informationplane that is shared among users, much as a network filesystem is shared. Objects are organized geographically;every object occupies a well defined region on the Padsurface.For navigation, Pad uses "portals" - magnifying glassesthat can peer into and roam over different parts of thissingle infinite shared desktop; links to specific itemsare established and broken continually as the portal'sview changes. Portals can recursively look onto otherportals. This paradigm enables the sort of peripheralactivity ge...

Title: Autonomous Interface Agents
Abstract: Two branches of the trend towards "agents" that are gainingcurrency are interface agents, software that actively assists auser in operating an interactive interface, and autonomousagents, software that takes action without user interventionand operates concurrently, either while the user is idle ortaking other actions. These two branches are related, but notidentical, and are often lumped together under the singleterm "agent". Much agent work can be classified as eitherbeing an interface agent, but not autonomous, or as anautonomous agent, but not operating directly in theinterface. We show why it is important to have agents thatare both interface agents and autonomous agents. Weexplore some design principles for such agents, andillustrate these principles with a description of Letizia, anautonomous interface agent that makes real-timesuggestions for Web pages that a user might be interestedin browsing.KeywordsAgents, interface agents, autonomous agents, Web,browsi...

The effects of this evolution have been less than elegant,and pressures for further evolution are mounting.

Title: Survey on User Interface Programming
Abstract: This paper reports on the results of a survey of user interfaceprogramming. The survey was widely distributed, andwe received 74 responses. The results show that in today'sapplications, an average of 48% of the code is devoted tothe user interface portion. The average time spent on theuser interface portion is 45% during the design phase, 50%during the implementation phase, and 37% during themaintenance phase. 34% of the systems were implementedusing a toolkit, 27% used a UIMS, 14% used an interfacebuilder, and 26% used no tools. The projects using onlytoolkits spent the largest percentage of the time and codeon the user interface (around 60%) compared to around45% for those with no tools. This appears to be becausethe toolkit systems had more sophisticated user interfaces.The projects using UIMSs or interface builders spent theleast percent of time and code on the user interface (around41%) suggesting that these tools are effective. In general,people were happy with the tools they used, especially thegraphical interface builders. The most common problemspeople reported when developing a user interface includedgetting users' requirements, writing help text, achievingconsistency, learning how to use the tools, getting acceptableperformance, and communicating among various partsof the program.

First, different visitors have distinct goals.Second, even a single visitor may have different needs at differenttimes. Much of the information at the site may also be dynamic ortime-dependent. Third, as the site grows and evolves, its originaldesign may no longer be appropriate. Finally, a site may be designedfor a particular purpose but used in unexpected ways. Web serversrecord data about user interactions and accumulate this data overtime. We believe that AI techniques can be used to examine useraccess logs in order to automatically improve the site.

Abstract: The Amulet user interface development environment makes it easier forprogrammers tocreate highly-interactive, graphical user interface software forUnix, Windows orMacintosh. Amulet uses new models for objects, constraints,animation, input, output,commands, and undo. The object system is a prototype-instance modelin which there isno distinction between classes and instances or between methods anddata. The constraintsystem allows any value of any object to be computed by arbitrarycode and supportsmultiple constraint solvers. Animations can be attached to existingobjects with a singleline of code. Input from the user is handled by"Interactor" objects which support reuse ofbehavior objects. The output model provides a declarative definitionof the graphics, andsupports automatic refresh. Command objects encapsulate all of theinformation neededabout operations, including support for various ways to undo them. Ankey feature of theAmulet design is that all graphical objec...

Title: A High-Level and Flexible Framework for Implementing Multiuser User Interfaces
Abstract: We have developed a high-level and flexible framework for supportingthe construction of multi-user user-interfaces. The framework isbased on a generalized editing interaction model, which allows usersto view programs as active data that can be concurrently edited bymultiple users. It consists of several novel components including arefinement of both the Seeheim UIMS architecture and the distributedgraphics architecture that explicitly addresses multi-userinteraction; the abstractions of shared active variables andinteraction variables, which allow users and applications to exchangeinformation; a set of default collaboration rules designed to keepthe collaboration-awareness low in multi- user programs; and a smallbut powerful set of primitives for overriding these rules. Theframework allows users to be dynamically added and removed from amulti-user session, different users to use different user interfacesto interact with an application, the modules interacting with aparticular user to execute on the local workstation, and program-mers to incrementally trade automation for flexibility. We haveimplemented the framework as part of a system called Suite. Thispaper motivates, describes, and illustrates the framework using theconcrete example of Suite, discusses how it can be implemented inother kinds of systems, compares it with related work, discusses itsshortcom- ings, and suggests directions for future work.

Title: Open Implementation Design Guidelines
Abstract: Designing reusable software modules can be extremely difficult. Thedesign must be balanced between being general enough to address theneeds of a wide range of clients and being focused enough to trulysatisfy the requirements of each specific client. One area where itcan be particularly difficult to strike this balance is in theimplementation strategy of the module. The problem is thatgeneralpurpose implementation strategies, tuned for a wide range ofclients, aren't necessarily optimal for each specific client ---thisis especially an issue for modules that are intended to be reusableand yet provide high-performance. An examination of existing softwaresystems shows that an increasingly important technique for handlingthis problem is to design the module's interface in such a way thatthe client can assist or participate in the selection of the module's implementation strategy. We call this approach openimplementation. When designing the interface to a module that allowsit...

Title: Why are Human-Computer Interfaces Difficult to Design and Implement?
Abstract: Everyone knows that designing and implementing human-computerinterfaces is difficult andtime-consuming. However, there is little discussion of why this istrue. Should we expect that anew method is around the corner that will make the design easier?Will the next generation ofuser interface toolkits make the implementation trivial? No. Thisarticle discusses reasons whyuser interface design and implementation are inherently difficulttasks and will remain so for theforeseeable future.Copyright  1993 - Carnegie Mellon UniversityThis research was sponsored by the Avionics Lab, Wright Research andDevelopment Center,Aeronautical Systems Division (AFSC), U.

Title: SpeechSkimmer: Interactively Skimming Recorded Speech
Abstract: Skimming or browsing audio recordings is much more difficult thanvisually scanning a document because of the temporal nature of audio.By exploiting properties of spontaneous speech it is possible toautomatically select and present salient audio segments in atime-efficient manner. Techniques for segmenting recordings and aprototype user interface for skimming speech are described. Thesystem developed incorporates time-compressed speech and pauseremoval to reduce the time needed to listen to speech recordings.This paper presents a multi-level approach to auditory skimming,along with user interface techniques for interacting with the audioand providing feedback. Several time compression algorithms and anadaptive speech detection technique are also summarized.

Title: Interactive graphic design using automatic presentation knowledge
Abstract: We present three novel tools for creating data graphics: (1)SageBrush, for assembling graphics from primitive objects like bars,lines and axes, (2) SageBook, for browsing previously createdgraphics relevant to current needs, and (3) SAGE, a knowledge-basedpresentation system that automatically designs graphics and alsointerprets a user's specifications conveyed with the other tools. Thecombination of these tools supports two complementary processes in asingle environment: design as a constructive process of selecting andarranging graphical elements, and design as a process of browsing andcustomizing previous cases. SAGE enhances userdirected design bycompleting partial specifications, by retrieving previously createdgraphics based on their appearance and data content, by creating thenovel displays that users specify, and by designing alternatives whenusers request them.

Abstract: Effective management of documents on computers hasbeen a central user interface problem for many years.One common approach involves using 2D spatial layoutsof icons representing the documents, particularly for informationworkspace tasks. This approach takes advantageof human 2D spatial cognition. More recently, several3D spatial layouts have engaged 3D spatial cognitioncapabilities. Some have attempted to use spatial memoryin 3D virtual environments. However, there has been noproof to date that spatial memory works the same way in3D virtual environments as it does in the real world. Wedescribe a new technique for document managementcalled the Data Mountain, which allows users to placedocuments at arbitrary positions on an inclined plane in a3D desktop virtual environment using a simple 2D interactiontechnique.

Title: Extending Hierarchical Constraint Logic Programming: Nonmonotonicity and Inter-Hierarchy Comparison
Abstract: Hierarchical Constraint Logic Programming languages extend ConstraintLogic Programming toinclude constraint hierarchies. These languages provide both requiredconstraints and default constraintsof various strengths. In the original definition of HCLP, alternatesolutions to a givenconstraint hierarchy were compared, and only the "best"solutions were returned. However, therewas no attempt to compare solutions arising from different choices ofrules in the logic program. Inmany practical applications of HCLP, to rule out unintuitivesolutions we do need to make such interhierarchy comparisons. Such comparisons introduce nonmonotonic behavior inHCLP programs. Wedefine two related nonmonotonicity properties of HCLP languages, andcompare these propertieswith those of standard nonmonotonic logics. The nonmonotonicityproperties create novel implementationproblems, which we discuss, while at the same time extending theusefulness of HCLPlanguages.Authors' addresses:Departmen...

Title: A framework for undoing actions in collaborative systems
Abstract: this paper, we propose a general framework for implementing undo incollaborative systems. The frameworkallows users to individually reverse their own changes, taking intoaccount the possibility of conflicts betweendifferent users' operations that may prevent an undo. The proposedframework has been incorporated intoDistEdit, a toolkit for building group text-editors. Based on ourexperience with DistEdit's undo facilities,we discuss several issues that need to be taken into account in usingthe framework, in order to ensure that areasonable undo behavior is provided to users. We show that theframework is also applicable to single-usersystems, since the operations to undo can be selected not just on thebasis of who performed them, but byany appropriate criterion, such as the document region in which theoperations occurred or the time intervalin which the operations were carried out.Categories and Subject Descriptors: D.2.2 [Software Engineering]:Tools and Techniques -- User Interfaces;H.1.2 [Models and Principles]: User/Machine Systems -- Human Factors;H.2.2 [Database

Title: Bayanihan: building and studying Web-based volunteer computing systems using Java
Abstract: Much of the current research in human-robot interaction is concernedwith single systems and single or few users. These systems and theirinterfaces are generally tightly-coupled and well-defined. Forlarge-scale humanrobot applications, the systems may be unknown priorto designing the interface for potential human interaction. Thispresents a difficult goal for allowing multiple users to interactwith many possibly unknown systems. In this paper, we present aninteraction infrastructure aligned with providing this interface. Itoperates in two phases that accommodate both many-to-many interactionand generalized, one-to-one interaction between users and roboticsystems. Our previous research has demonstrated the infrastructure toscale to a large number of users and several systems in simulation.The experiments in this paper substantiate these results in asmaller-scale real robotic environment.

Title: Where should the person stop and the information search interface start
Abstract: Many users of online and other automated information systems want totake advantage ofthe speed and power of automated retrieval, while still controllingand directing the steps of thesearch themselves. They do not want the system to take over and carryout the search entirelyfor them. Yet the objective of much of current theory andexperimentation in informationretrieval systems and interfaces is to design systems in which theuser has either no or onlyreactive involvement with the search process. It is argued here thatthe advanced informationretrieval research community is missing an opportunity to designsystems that are in betterharmony with the actual preferences of many users--sophisticatedsystems that provide anoptimal combination of searcher control and system retrieval power.The user may be provided effective means of directing the search ifcapabilities specific tothe information retrieval process, that is, strategic behaviorsnormally associated withinformation searching, are incorporated into the interface. There aremany questions concerning1) the degree of user vs. system involvement in the search, and 2)the size, or chunking, ofactivities, that is, how much and what type of activity the usershould be able to direct thesystem to do at once. These two dimensions are analyzed and a numberof configurations ofsystem capability that combine user and system control are presentedand discussed. In theprocess, the concept of the information search stratagem isintroduced, and particular attentionis paid to the provision of strategic, as opposed to purelyprocedural capabilities for thesearcher. Finally, certain of the types of user-system relationshipare selected as deserving2particular attention in future information retrieval system d...

As interface workhas increasingly become a focus of attention for the social sciences,we have expanded our appreciation ofthe importance of issues such as work practice, adaptation andevolution in interactive systems.The reorientation in our view of interactive systems has beenaccompanied by a call for a new model ofdesign centred around user needs and participation. This paper arguesthat a new process of design is notenough, and that the new view necessitates a similar reorientation inthe structure of the systems we build.It outlines some requirements for systems which support a deeperconception of interaction, and argues thatthe traditional system design techniques are not suited to creatingsuch systems.

Title: Usability Analysis of Visual Programming Environments: A 'Cognitive Dimensions' Framework
Abstract: this paper we shall describe a less detailed approach, specificallyintended to be useful outside the specialist world of HCI. We haveapplied this `cognitive dimensions' framework to a selection ofdifferent enduser programming environments [1]. The frameworkdescribes about a dozen dimensions, or cognitivelyrelevant aspects,of a programming environment (or of any other kind of system). Formost people the concepts employed will be immediately recognizablebut will not have been named before; explicitly listing and namingthe dimensions gives designers a better chance to avoid oversightsand can improve the level of critical discourse by providing a sharedvocabulary. What determines usability? Glinert ([2], p. 170 ff) haselegantly stated the need for investigation of cognitive issuesrelated to programming environment design for non-textual languages.However, he distinguished only two cognitive aspects: ease oflearning and system understandability. These are important but quiteinsufficient. A programming language may be easy to learn and easy tounderstand, but its environment may make it unusable. Usability isdetermined by a whole complex of cognitive factors. Each of thevarious tasks that make up programming must be easy enough to do,including learning the language, creating the design, coding it,checking, modification, comprehension, and explanation. (There arealso many non-cognitive issues, some inter-personal and somearchitectural, that we shall not discuss.) Moreover, the particularcontext deter- 2

We first develop a framework for two-handed interaction andthen explore a variety of two-handed 3D tools and interactivetechniques. Related issues include how constraints are implementedand controlled by the two hands and how transitions betweenone-handedandtwo-handed tasks occur seemlessly. Informal observationsof the system in practice show that users can perform navigation andmanipulation tasks easily and with little training using thetwo-handed environment.

Abstract: Currently, building a user interface involves creating a largeprocedural program. Modelbasedprogramming provides an alternative new paradigm.

Based on the model, amuch smallerprocedural program then determines the behavior of the system.There are several advantages to this approach. The declarative modelis a commonrepresentation that tools can reason about, enabling the constructionof tools that automatevarious aspects of interface design, that assist system builders inthe creation of themodel, that automatically provide context sensitive help and otherrun-time assistance tousers.

Title: The System Architect's Workbench
Abstract: This paper presents an overview of The SystemArchitect's Workbench, a behavioral synthesis systemunder development at Carnegie Mellon University. Thissystem converts an abstract behavioral description of apiece of hardware into a set of register-transfercomponents and a control sequence table. Two synthesismethodologies are supported: one is tuned specifically todesign microprocessors, and the other supports a moregeneral design style. Results are presented here for bothapproaches.IntroductionRecently, considerable research effort has beendirected toward the synthesis of register transfer leveldesigns from abstract behavioral descriptions[McFarland86, Pangrle86, Parker86, Paulin86]. Each ofthese efforts has defined a behavioral representation thatdescribes only the function of a system to be built, much inthe same way that a software program describes only afunction. Synthesis research at this level has then focusedon the specification of the control schedule and da...

Title: Towards adaptive Web sites: conceptual framework and case study
Abstract: The creation of a complex web site is a thorny problem in userinterface design. In this paper we explore the notion of adaptive websites: sites that semi-automatically improve their organization andpresentation by learning from visitor access patterns. It is easy toimagine and implement web sites that offer shortcuts to popularpages. Are more sophisticated adaptive web sites feasible? Whatdegree of automation can we achieve? To address the questions above,we describe the design space of adaptive web sites and consider acase study: the problem of synthesizing new index pages thatfacilitate navigation of a web site. We present the PageGatheralgorithm, which automatically identifies candidate link sets toinclude in index pages based on user access logs. We demonstrateexperimentally that PageGather outperforms the Apriori data miningalgorithm on this task. In addition, we compare PageGather's linksets to pre-existing, human-authored index pages.

Title: Eye tracking in advanced interface design
Abstract: INTRODUCTION The problem of human-computer interaction can be viewedas two powerful information processors (human and computer)attempting to communicate with each other via a narrowbandwidth,highly constrained interface [23]. To address it, we seek faster,more natural, and more convenient means for users and computers toexchange information. The user's side is constrained by the nature ofhuman communication organs and abilities; the computer's isconstrained only by input/output devices and interaction techniquesthat we can invent. Current technology has been stronger in thecomputer-to-user direction than user-to-computer, hence today'suser-computer dialogues are rather one-sided, with the bandwidth fromthe computer to the user far greater than that from user to computer.Using eye movements as a user-tocomputer communication medium canhelp redress this imbalance.

Abstract: Thisarticle provides an overview of the EPIC architecture being developedbyKieras and Meyer for modeling human cognition and performance(Kieras, Wood, & Meyer, 1997; Meyer & Kieras, 1997a, 1997b).EPIC issimilar in spirit to the Model Human Processor (MHP; Card, Moran,&Newell, 1983), but EPIC incorporates many recent theoretical andempiri-cal results about human performance in the form of a softwareframeworkfor computer simulation modeling. Using EPIC, a model can be con-structed that represents the general procedures required to perform acomplex multimodal task a a set of production rules. When the modelissupplied with the external stimuli for a specffic task, it will thenexecutethe procedures in whatever way the task requires, thus simulating ahuman's performing the task and generating the predicted actions insimulatedreal time.

Title: 3-Dimensional Pliable Surfaces: For the Effective Presentation of Visual Information
Abstract: A fundamental issue in user interface design is the effectiveuse of available screen space, commonly referred to asthe screen real estate problem. This paper presents a newdistortion-based viewing tool for exploring large informationspaces through the use of a three-dimensional pliable surface.Arbitrarily-shaped regions (foci) on the surface may be selectedand pulled towards or pushed away from the viewerthereby increasing or decreasing the level of detail containedwithin each region. Furthermore, multiple foci are smoothlyblended together such that there is no loss of context. Themanipulation and blending of foci is accomplished using afairly simple mathematical model based on gaussian curves.The significance of this approach is that it utilizes precognitiveperceptual cues about the three-dimensional surface tomake the distortions comprehensible, and allows the user tointeractively control the location, shape, and extent of thedistortion in very large graphs or maps....

Title: Generating and Solving Imperfect Information Games
Abstract: Work on game playing in AI has typically ignoredgames of imperfect information such as poker. Inthis paper, we present a framework for dealing withsuch games. We point out several important issuesthat arise only in the context of imperfect informationgames, particularly the insufficiency of asimple game tree model to represent the players'information state and the need for randomization inthe players' optimal strategies. We describe Gala,an implemented system that provides the user with avery natural and expressive language for describinggames. From a game description, Gala creates anaugmented game tree with information sets whichcan be used by various algorithms in order to findoptimal strategies for that game. In particular, Galaimplements the first practical algorithm for findingoptimal randomized strategies in two-player imperfectinformation competitive games [Koller et al.,1994] .

Title: Two Pointer Input for 3D Interaction
Abstract: We explore a range of techniques that use two hands to control twoindependent cursors to perform operations in 3D desktop applications.Based on research results in 2D applications, we believe thattwo-handed input provides the potential for creating more efficientand more fluid interfaces, especially for tasks that arecontext-sensitive or that have many degrees of freedom. These tasksappear frequently in 3D applications and are commonly broken downinto a series of sequential operations, each controlling fewerdegrees of freedom -- even though this may dramatically change thecharacter of the task. However, two-handed interaction, in theory,makes it possible to perform the same tasks using half the number ofsequential steps since two previously sequential operations can beperformed simultaneously. In addition, many forms of two-handedinteraction may be simpler to use and to understand since theycorrespond to common interactions in the physical world. It issignificant when ta...

Title: StarT-jr: A Parallel System from Commodity Technology
Abstract: StarT-jr is an experimental parallel system composed of a network ofpersonal computers (PCs). The system leverages the momentum of themicroprocessor and PC industries to achieve excellent single nodeperformance at a low cost. For parallel processing, StarT-jr uses theFlexible User-level Network Interface (FUNi) to provide low-overhead,user-level interprocessor communication over two IEEE 1394 High SpeedSerial Busses. This efficient message-passing mechanism enablesStarT-jr to exploit fine-grained parallelism for good parallelperformance. FUNi is based on an embedded coprocessor on a standardPCI card. Custom network hardware assembled from off-the-shelf 1394silicon provides the FUNi coprocessor with direct access to the 1394network. In order to avoid the long latency of accessing PCI devicesfrom the host processor, FUNi's message-passing interface utilizessoftware-managed message buffers in the host memory.

The fastesthigh-speed networks approach or exceed the I/O bus bandwidths of"gigabitready " hosts. These advances introduce newconsiderations for the design of network interfaces and messagingsystems for low-latency communication. This paper investigatescut-through delivery, a technique for overlapping host I/O DMAtransfers with network traversal. Cut-through delivery significantlyreduces end-to-end latency of large messages, which are oftencritical for application performance.

Title: Ontology-based user modeling in an augmented audio reality system for museums," User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction. 2005
Abstract: Ubiquitous computing is a challenging area that allows us to further our understanding and techniques of context-aware and adaptive systems. Among the challenges is the general problem of capturing the larger context in interaction from the perspective of user modeling and humancomputer interaction (HCI). The imperative to address this issue is great considering the emergence of ubiquitous and mobile computing environments. This paper provides an account of our addressing the specific problem of supporting functionality as well as the experience design issues related to museum visits through user modeling in combination with an audio augmented reality and tangible user interface system. This paper details our deployment and evaluation of ec(h)o  an augmented audio reality system for museums. We explore the possibility of supporting a contextaware adaptive system by linking environment, interaction object and users at an abstract semantic level instead of at the content level. From the user modeling perspective ec(h)o is a knowledgebased recommender system. In this paper we present our findings from user testing and how our approach works well with an audio and tangible user interface within a ubiquitous computing system. We conclude by showing where further research is needed.

Title: Use of Praise and Punishment in Human-Robot Collaborative Teams
Abstract: Robots, specifically androids, become increasingly important in the consumer market where they are marketed as toys or companions, as well as in the industry, where they will increasingly often play the role of a co-worker. The developers in various robotics communities are divided about design issues in these companion-worker androids. While some robot developers believe people will work more effectively with humanoid robots in the role of companion or co-worker because of a more natural interaction, others think its necessary to maintain a machine-like interface to avoid distractions. Consequently, the ability of humans to coordinate and interact with robots, and human perceptions and actions based on varying levels of humanlike robot interfaces are of great interest. This paper presents preliminary results from a study that investigated how people use praise and punishment in a collaborative game scenario. Subjects played a game together with humans, computers, and anthropomorphic and zoomorphic robots. They could give plus points and minus points as praise and punishment for correct or wrong partner answers. Results show that praise and punishment were used the same way for computer and human partners. Yet robots, which are essentially computers with an embodiment, were treated differently. Very machinelike robots were treated just like the computer and the human; robots very high on anthropomorphism / zoomorphism were praised more and punished less.

Title: Sketching User Experiences Getting the Design Right and the Right Design
Abstract: There is almost a fervor in the way that new products, with their rich and dynamic interfaces, are being released to the publictypi-cally promising to make lives easier, solve the most difficult of problems, and maybe even make the world a better place. The reality is that few of these products survive, much less deliver on their promise. The folly? An absence of design, and an over reliance on just technology and/or traditional practice. We need design. But design as described here depends on the skills of a number of different communitieseach essential, but on their own, none sufficient. In this rich ecology, designers are faced with new challengeschallenges that build on, rather than replace, existing skills and practice. Sketching User Experiences approaches design and design thinking as something distinct that needs to be better understood by both designers and the people with whom they need to work in order to achieve success with these new types of products and systems. So while the focus is on design, the approach is holistic. Hence, the book speaks to designers, usability specialists, people from HCI, product managers and business executives. There is an emphasis on balancing the back-end concern with usability and engineering excellence (getting the design right) with an up-front investment in sketching and ideation (getting the right design). Overall, the objective is building the notion of informed design, molding emerging technology into a form that serves our society and reflects its values. Grounded in both practice and scientific research, Bill Buxtons engaging work aims to spark the imagination while encouraging the use of new techniques, breathing new life into user experience design.

Title: Interaction patterns for auditory user interfaces
Abstract: This paper proposes the use of interaction patterns in the design process of auditory displays in human-computer interaction. To avoid introducing visual concepts in auditory design, a common ground for developing user interfaces without determining their means of representation is proposed. This meta domain allows for the design of user interfaces which can be equally realised in different interaction modalities or multi-modal settings. Although this work focuses on the auditory domain the concept shown is developed keeping in mind that it should be equally applicable in other modalities. A set of mode independent interaction patterns for design in the meta domain are introduced along with their transformation into the auditory domain. A real world application was chosen to evaluate the approach. MS Explorer was analysed, described through the mode independent interaction patterns and transformed into the auditory domain making extensive use of 3D audio rendering techniques. The result, a virtual audio reality version of a file manager, was evaluated with normally sighted persons as well as visually impaired and blind participants showing the feasibility and usability of the approach. 1.

Abstract: We derive a new self-organising learning algorithm which maximisesthe information transferred in a network of non-linear units. Thealgorithmdoes not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, andis defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions,informationmaximisation has extra properties not found in the linear case(Linsker 1989). The non-linearities in the transfer function are abletopick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and performsomething akin to true redundancy reduction between units in theoutputrepresentation. This enables the network to separate statisticallyindependent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalisationofPrincipal Components Analysis.We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party)problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to tenspeakers.We also show that a variant on the network architecture is ableto perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes andre...

While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill forgeneralization performance, and while at present there exists notheory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteedfor SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed highaccura...

Title: Minimizing Conflicts: A Heuristic Repair Method for Constraint Satisfaction and Scheduling Problems
Abstract: This paper describes a simple heuristic approach to solvinglarge-scale constraint satisfaction andscheduling problems. In this approach one starts with an inconsistentassignment for a set of variablesand searches through the space of possible repairs. The search can beguided by a value-ordering heuristic,the min-conflicts heuristic, that attempts to minimize the number ofconstraint violations after each step.The heuristic can be used with a variety of different searchstrategies.We demonstrate empirically that on the n-queens problem, a techniquebased on this approach performsorders of magnitude better than traditional backtracking techniques.We also describe a schedulingapplication where the approach has been used successfully. Atheoretical analysis is presented both toexplain why this method works well on certain types of problems andto predict when it is likely to bemost effective.1 IntroductionOne of the most promising general approaches for solvingcombinator...

Due tothe combinatorial natureof the hidden state representation, this exact algorithm isintractable.

Abstract: We present a system for recognizing human faces from single imagesout of a large database with one image per person. The task isdifficult because of image variance in terms of position, size,expression and pose. The system collapses most of this variance byextracting concise face descriptions in the form of image graphs. Inthese, fiducial points on the face (eyes, mouth etc.) are describedby sets of wavelet components (jets). Image graph extraction is basedon a novel approach, the bunch graph, which is constructed from asmall set of sample image graphs. Recognition is based on astraightforward comparison of image graphs.

We propose an approachthat utilizes the hierarchical topic structure to decompose theclassification task into a set of simpler problems, one at each nodein the classification tree. As we show, each of these smallerproblems can be solved accurately by focusing only on a very smallset of features, those relevant to the task at hand. This set ofrelevant features varies widely throughout the hierarchy, so that,while the overall relevant feature set may be large, each classifieronly examines a small subset.

The problem of theory refinement under uncertainty isreviewed here in the context of Bayesian statistics, a theory ofbelief revision. The problem is reduced to an incremental learningtask as follows: the learning system is initially primed with apartial theory supplied by a domain expert, and thereafter maintainsits own internal representation of alternative theories which is ableto be interrogated by the domain expert and able to be incrementallyrefined from data. Algorithms for refinement of Bayesian networks arepresented to illustrate what is meant by "partial theory","alternative theory representation ", etc. The algorithmsare an incremental variant of batch learning algorithms from theliterature so can work well in batch and incremental mode. 1Introduction Theory refinement is the task of updating a domaintheory in the light of...

Abstract: Sample complexity results from computational learning theory, whenapplied toneural network learning for pattern classification problems, suggestthat for good generalizationperformance the number of training examples should grow at leastlinearlywith the number of adjustable parameters in the network. Results inthis paper showthat if a large neural network is used for a pattern classificationproblem and thelearning algorithm finds a network with small weights that has smallsquared error onthe training patterns, then the generalization performance depends onthe size of theweights rather than the number of weights. For example, consider atwo-layer feedforwardnetwork of sigmoid units, in which the sum of the magnitudes of theweightsassociated with each unit is bounded by A and the input dimension isn. We showthat the misclassification probability is no more than a certainerror estimate (that isrelated to squared error on the training set) plus A3 p(log n)=m (ignori...

Title: Knowledge-Based Artificial Neural Networks
Abstract: Hybrid learning methods use theoretical knowledge of a domain and aset of classified examplesto develop a method for accurately classifying examples not seenduring training. The challenge ofhybrid learning systems is to use the information provided by onesource of information to offsetinformation missing from the other source. By so doing, a hybridlearning system should learnmore effectively than systems that use only one of the informationsources. Kbann(Knowledge-Based Artificial Neural Networks) is a hybrid learning system builton top of connectionist learningtechniques. It maps problem-specific "domain theories",represented in propositional logic, intoneural networks and then refines this reformulated knowledge usingbackpropagation. Kbann isevaluated by extensive empirical tests on two problems from molecularbiology.

Title: Face Recognition Under Varying Pose
Abstract: Researchers in computer vision and pattern recognition have worked onautomatic techniques for recognizinghuman faces for the last 20 years. While some systems, especiallytemplate-based ones, have beenquite successful on expressionless, frontal views of faces withcontrolled lighting, not much work has takenface recognizers beyond these narrow imaging conditions. Our goal isto build a face recognizer that worksunder varying pose, the difficult part of which is to handle facerotations in depth. Building on successfultemplate-based systems (especially Brunelli and Poggio[7]), our basicapproach is to represent faces withtemplates from multiple model views that cover different poses fromthe viewing sphere. To recognize anovel view, the recognizer locates the eyes and nose features, usesthese locations to geometrically registerthe input with model views, and then uses correlation on modeltemplates to find the best match in thedata base of people.

Abstract: For many types of machine learning algorithms, one can compute thestatistically "optimal" way to select training data. In this paper, we review howoptimal data selectiontechniques have been used with feedforward neural networks. We thenshow how the sameprinciples may be used to select data for two alternative,statistically-based learning architectures:mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression. While thetechniquesfor neural networks are computationally expensive and approximate,the techniques formixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression are bothefficient and accurate. Empirically,we observe that the optimality criterion sharply decreases the numberof trainingexamples the learner needs in order to achieve good performance.1.

Abstract: This paper describes experimental results on using Winnow andWeighted-Majority based algorithms on a real-world calendarscheduling domain. These two algorithms have been highly studied inthe theoretical machine learning literature. We show here that thesealgorithms can be quite competitive practically, outperforming thedecision-tree approach currently in use in the Calendar Apprenticesystem in terms of both accuracy and speed. One of the contributionsof this paper is a new variant on the Winnow algorithm (used in theexperiments) that is especially suited to conditions withstringvalued classifications, and we give a theoretical analysis ofits performance. In addition we show how Winnow can be applied toachieve a good accuracy/coverage tradeoff and explore issues thatarise such as concept drift. We also provide an analysis of a policyfor discarding predictors in Weighted-Majority that allows it tospeed up as it learns. Keywords: Winnow, Weighted-Majority,Multiplicative alg...

The evolutionary approachto the development of neural controllers for autonomous agents hasbeen successfully used by many researchers, but most-if not all-studies have been carried out with computer simulations. Instead, inthis research the whole evolutionary process takes places entirely ona real robot without human intervention. Although the experimentsdescribed here tackle a simple task of navigation and obstacleavoidance, we show a number of emergent phenomena that arecharacteristic of autonomous agents. The neural controllers of theevolved best individuals display a full exploitation of non-linearand recurrent connections that make them more efficient thananalogous man-designed agents.

The framework makespossible: (1) objective comparisons between solutions usingalternative network architectures; (2) objective stopping rules fornetwork pruning or growing procedures; (3) objective choice ofmagnitude and type of weight decay terms or additive regularisers(for penalising large weights, etc.); (4) a measure of the effectivenumber of well--determined parameters in a model; (5) quantifiedestimates of the error bars on network parameters and on networkoutput; (6) objective comparisons with alternative learning andinterpolation models such as splines and radial basis functions. TheBayesian `evidence' automatically embodies `Occam's razor,'penalising over--flexible and over--complex models. The Bayesianapproach helps detect poor underlying assumptions in learning models.For learning models well matched to a problem, a good correlationbetween generalisat...

Previously, we have shown that these receptive fieldproperties maybe accounted for in terms of a strategy for producing a sparsedistribution ofoutput activity in response to natural images (Olshausen and Field,1996a).Here, in addition to describing this work in a more expansivefashion, we examinethe neurobiological implications of sparse coding. Of particularinterestis the case when the code is overcomplete---i.e., when the number ofcode elementsis greater than the effective dimensionality of the input space.Becausethe basis functions are non-orthogonal and not linearly independentof eachother, sparsifying the code will recruit only those basis functionsnecessary forrepresenting a given input, and so the input-output fun...

Title: Natural Gradient Works Efficiently in Learning
Abstract: When a parameter space has a certain underlying structure, theordinary gradient ofa function does not represent its steepest direction but the naturalgradient does. Informationgeometry is used for calculating the natural gradients in theparameter space ofperceptrons, the space of matrices (for blind source separation) andthe space of lineardynamical systems (for blind source deconvolution). The dynamicalbehavior of naturalgradient on-line learning is analyzed and is proved to be Fisherefficient, implying that ithas asymptotically the same performance as the optimal batchestimation of parameters.This suggests that the plateau phenomenon which appears in thebackpropagation learningalgorithm of multilayer perceptrons might disappear or might be notso serious when thenatural gradient is used. An adaptive method of updating the learningrate is proposedand analyzed.1 IntroductionThe stochastic gradient method (Widrow, 1963; Amari, 1967; Tsypkin,1973; Rumelhart etal...

Title: Improving Generalization with Active Learning
Abstract: Active learning differs from passive "learning fromexamples" in that the learning algorithm assumes at least somecontrol over what part of the input domain it receives informationabout. In some situations, active learning is provably more powerfulthat learning from examples alone, giving better generalization for afixed number of training examples. In this paper, we consider theproblem of learning a binary concept in the absence of noise (Valiant1984). We describe a formalism for active concept learning calledselective sampling, and show how it may be approximately implementedby a neural network. In selective sampling, a learner receivesdistribution information from the environment and queries an oracleon parts of the domain it considers "useful." We test ourimplementation, called an SG-network, on three domains, and observesignificant improvement in generalization.

Abstract: We pursue a particular approach to analog computation, based ondynamical systems of thetype used in neural networks research.Our systems have a fixed structure, invariant in time, correspondingto an unchanging numberof "neurons". If allowed exponential time for computation,they turn out to have unboundedpower. However, under polynomial-time constraints there are limits ontheir capabilities, thoughbeing more powerful than Turing Machines. (A similar but morerestricted model was shown to bepolynomial-time equivalent to classical digital computation in theprevious work [20].) Moreover,there is a precise correspondence between nets and standardnon-uniform circuits with equivalentresources, and as a consequence one has lower bound constraints onwhat they can compute. Thisrelationship is perhaps surprising since our analog devices do notchange in any manner with inputsize.We note that these networks are not likely to solve polynomiallyNP-hard problems, as theequality "p...

Title: Competitive Environments Evolve Better Solutions for Complex Tasks
Abstract: In the typical genetic algorithm experiment, the fitness function isconstructed to be independent of the contents of the population toprovide a consistent objective measure. Such objectivity entailssignificant knowledge about the environment which suggests either theproblem has previously been solved or other non-evolutionarytechniques may be more efficient. Furthermore, for many complex tasksan independent fitness function is either impractical or impossibleto provide. In this paper, we demonstrate that competitive fitnessfunctions, i.e. fitness functions that are dependent on theconstituents of the population, can provide a more robust trainingenvironment than independent fitness functions. We describe threediffering methods for competitive fitness, and discuss theirrespective advantages. 1 INTRODUCTION Competitive learning is a longstanding topic in machine learning (Samuel, 1959; Tesauro, 1992).Interest for using competition in machine learning tasks stems from ade...

Abstract: We investigate the consequences of maximizing information transfer ina simple neural network (one input layer, one output layer),focussing on the case of non linear transfer functions. We assumethat both receptive fields (synaptic efficacies) and transferfunctions can be adapted to the environment. The main result is that,for bounded and invertible transfer functions, in the case of avanishing additive output noise, and no input noise, maximization ofinformation (Linsker'sinfomax principle) leads to a factorial code -hence to the same solution as required by the redundancy reductionprinciple of Barlow. We show also that this result is valid forlinear, more generally unbounded, transfer functions, providedoptimization is performed under an additive constraint, that is whichcan be written as a sum of terms, each one being specific to oneoutput neuron. Finally we study the effect of a non zero input noise.We find that, at first order in the input noise, assumed to be small...

Abstract: Nearest-neighbour interpolation algorithms have many usefulpropertiesfor applications to learning, but they often exhibit poorgeneralization.In this paper, it is shown that much better generalizationcan be obtained by using a variable interpolation kernel incombinationwith conjugate gradient optimization of the similarity metricand kernel size. The resulting method is called variable-kernelsimilaritymetric (VSM) learning. It has been tested on several standardclassification data sets, and on these problems it shows bettergeneralizationthan back propagation and most other learning methods.An important advantage is that the system can operate as a blackbox in which no model minimization parameters need to beexperimentallyset by the user. The number of parameters that must bedetermined through optimization are orders of magnitude less thanfor back-propagation or RBF networks, which may indicate that themethod better captures the essential degrees of variation inlearni...

Title: A Simple Weight Decay Can Improve Generalization
Abstract: It has been observed in numerical simulations that a weight decay canimprovegeneralization in a feed-forward neural network. This paper explainswhy. It is proven that a weight decay has two effects in a linearnetwork.First, it suppresses any irrelevant components of the weight vectorbychoosing the smallest vector that solves the learning problem.Second, ifthe size is chosen right, a weight decay can suppress some of theeffects ofstatic noise on the targets, which improves generalization quite alot. Itis then shown how to extend these results to networks with hiddenlayersand non-linear units. Finally the theory is confirmed by somenumericalsimulations using the data from NetTalk.1 INTRODUCTIONMany recent studies have shown that the generalization ability of aneural network(or any other `learning machine') depends on a balance between theinformation inthe training examples and the complexity of the network, see forinstance [1, 2, 3].Bad generalization occurs if ...

Title: Keeping neural networks simple by minimizing the description length of the weights
Abstract: Supervised neural networks generalize well ifthere is much less information in the weightsthan there is in the output vectors of the trainingcases. So during learning, it is importantto keep the weights simple by penalizingthe amount of information they contain.The amount of information in a weight canbe controlled by adding Gaussian noise andthe noise level can be adapted during learningto optimize the trade-off between the expectedsquared error of the network and the amountof information in the weights. We describea method of computing the derivatives of theexpected squared error and of the amount ofinformation in the noisy weights in a networkthat contains a layer of non-linear hiddenunits. Provided the output units are linear, theexact derivatives can be computed efficientlywithout time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations.The idea of minimizing the amount ofinformation that is required to communicatethe weights of a neural network leads to anumber of interesting...

Preliminary results show that the method does find modularnetworks, and that those networks outperform `standard' solutions.The method looks very promising, although the experiments done weretoo limited to draw any general conclusions.

The primary goal of an unsupervised learningprocedure is to optimize the qualityof a system's internal representation.

TheMDL principle states that the best model is one that minimizes thesummed description length ofthe model and the data with respect to the model. Applying thisapproach to the unsupervisedlearning problem makes explicit a key trade off between the accuracyof a representation (i.e., howconcise a description of the input may be generated from it) and itssuccinctness (i.e., how compactlythe representation itself can be described).Viewing existing unsupervised learning procedures in terms of theframework exposes their implicitassumptions about the type of structure assumed to underlie the data.While...

Title: Error-correcting output codes: a general method for improving multiclass inductive learning programs
Abstract: Multiclass learning problems involve finding a definitionfor an unknown function f(x) whose range is adiscrete set containing k ? 2 values (i.e., k "classes").The definition is acquired by studying large collectionsof training examples of the form hx i ; f(x i )i. Existingapproaches to this problem include (a) direct applicationof multiclass algorithms such as the decision-treealgorithms ID3 and CART, (b) application of binaryconcept learning algorithms to learn individual binaryfunctions for each of the k classes, and (c) applicationof binary concept learning algorithms with distributedoutput codes such as those employed by Sejnowski andRosenberg in the NETtalk system. This paper comparesthese three approaches to a new technique inwhich BCH error-correcting codes are employed as adistributed output representation. We show that theseoutput representations improve the performance of ID3on the NETtalk task and of backpropagation on anisolated-letter speech-recognition t...

Title: Discriminant analysis by Gaussian mixtures
Abstract: Fisher-Rao linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a valuable tool formultigroup classification. LDA is equivalent to maximum likelihoodclassification assuming Gaussian distributions for each class. Inthis paper, we fitted Gaussian mixtures to each class to facilitateeffective classification in non-normal settings, especially when theclasses are clustered. Low dimensional views are an importantby-product of LDA---our new techniques inherit this feature. We areable to control the withinclass spread of the subclass centresrelative to the between-class spread. Our technique for fitting thesemodels permits a natural blend with nonparametric versions of LDA.Keywords: Classification, Pattern Recognition, Clustering,Nonparametric Regression, Radial Basis Functions. 1 Introduction Inthe generic classification or discrimination problem, the outcome ofinterest G falls into J unordered classes, which for convenience wedenote by the set J = f1; 2; 3; \Delta \Delta \Delta Jg.

Title: Face Recognition: A Convolutional Neural Network Approach
Abstract: Faces represent complex, multidimensional, meaningful visual stimuliand developing a computational model for face recognition isdifficult [43]. We present a hybrid neural network solution whichcompares favorably with other methods. The system combines localimage sampling, a self-organizing map neural network, and aconvolutional neural network. The self-organizing map provides aquantization of the image samples into a topological space whereinputs that are nearby in the original space are also nearby in theoutput space, thereby providing dimensionality reduction andinvariance to minor changes in the image sample, and theconvolutional neural network provides for partial invariance totranslation, rotation, scale, and deformation. The convolutionalnetwork extracts successively larger features in a hierarchical setof layers. We present results using the Karhunen-Loeve transform inplace of the self-organizing map, and a multi-layer perceptron inplace of the convolutional netwo...

Title: Exploiting Tractable Substructures in Intractable Networks
Abstract: We develop a refined mean field approximation for inference andlearning in probabilistic neural networks. Our mean field theory,unlike most, does not assume that the units behave as independentdegrees of freedom; instead, it exploits in a principled way theexistence of large substructures that are computationally tractable.To illustrate the advantages of this framework, we show how toincorporate weak higher order interactions into a first-order hiddenMarkov model, treating the corrections (but not the first orderstructure) within mean field theory.1 INTRODUCTIONLearning the parameters in a probabilistic neural network may beviewed as aproblem in statistical estimation. In networks with sparseconnectivity (e.g. treesand chains), there exist efficient algorithms for the exactprobabilistic calculationsthat support inference and learning. In general, however, thesecalculations areintractable, and approximations are required.Mean field theory provides a framework for app...

Title: Monte Carlo implementation of Gaussian process models for Bayesian regression    and classification
Abstract: . Gaussian processes are a natural way of defining priordistributions over functionsof one or more input variables. In a simple nonparametric regressionproblem, wheresuch a function gives the mean of a Gaussian distribution for anobserved response, aGaussian process model can easily be implemented using matrixcomputations that arefeasible for datasets of up to about a thousand cases.Hyperparameters that define thecovariance function of the Gaussian process can be sampled usingMarkov chain methods.Regression models where the noise has a t distribution and logisticor probit models forclassification applications can be implemented by sampling as wellfor latent values underlyingthe observations. Software is now available that implements thesemethods usingcovariance functions with hierarchical parameterizations. Modelsdefined in this way candiscover high-level properties of the data, such as which inputs arerelevant to predictingthe response.1 IntroductionA nonparam...

Title: Probable networks and plausible predictions - a review of practical Bayesian methods for supervised neural networks
Abstract: Bayesian probability theory provides a unifying framework for datamodelling. In this framework the overall aims are to find models thatare well matched to the data, and to use these models to make optimalpredictions. Neural network learning is interpreted as an inferenceof the most probable parameters for the model, given the trainingdata. The search in model space (i.e., the space of architectures,noise models, preprocessings, regularizers and weight decayconstants) can then also be treated as an inference problem, in whichwe infer the relative probability of alternative models, given thedata. This review describes practical techniques based on Gaussianapproximations for implementation of these powerful methods forcontrolling, comparing and using adaptive networks.

Title: Independent Component Analysis Using an Extended Infomax Algorithm for Mixed Sub-Gaussian and Super-Gaussian Sources
Abstract: An extension of the infomax algorithm of Bell and Sejnowski (1995) ispresented that is able to blindly separate mixed signals with sub-and super-Gaussian source distributions. This was achieved by using asimple type of learning rule first derived by Girolami (1997) bychoosing negentropy as a projection pursuit index. Parameterizedprobability distributions that have suband super-Gaussian regimeswere used to derive a general learning rule that preserves the simplearchitecture proposed by Bell and Sejnowski (1995), is optimizedusing the natural gradient by Amari (1998), and uses the stabilityanalysis of Cardoso and Laheld (1996) to switch between sub- andsuper-Gaussian regimes. We demonstrate that the extended infomaxalgorithm is able to easily separate 20 sources with a variety ofsource distributions. Applied to high-dimensional data fromelectroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, it is effective atseparating artifacts such as eye blinks and line noise from weakerelectrical ...

Pearlmutter and Parra (1996) andCardoso (1997) showed that the infomax approach of Bell and Sejnowski(1995) and the maximum likelihood estimation approach are equivalent.We show that negentropy maximization also has equivalent propertiesand therefore all three approaches yield the same learning rule for afixed nonlinearity. Girolami and Fyfe (1997a) have shown that thenonlinear Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm of Karhunenand Joutsensalo (1994) and Oja (1997) can also be viewed frominformation-theoretic principles since it minimizes the sum ofsquares of the fourth-order marginal cumulants and thereforeapproximately minimizes the mutual information (Comon, 1994).

In thispaper, we apply a form of the competitive philosophy for the firsttime to theproblem of prefetching to develop an optimal universal prefetcher interms offault ratio, with particular applications to large-scale databasesand hypertextsystems. Our algorithms for prefetching are novel in that they arebased ondata compression techniques that are both theoretically optimal andgood inpractice. Intuitively, in order to compress data effectively, youhave to be ableto predict future data well, and thus good data compressors should beable topredict well for purposes of prefetching.

Abstract: . An important component of many data mining projects is finding agood classification algorithm,a process that requires very careful thought about experimentaldesign. If not done very carefully, comparativestudies of classification and other types of algorithms can easilyresult in statistically invalid conclusions. Thisis especially true when one is using data mining techniques toanalyze very large databases, which inevitablycontain some statistically unlikely data. This paper describesseveral phenomena that can, if ignored, invalidatean experimental comparison. These phenomena and the conclusions thatfollow apply not only to classification,but to computational experiments in almost any aspect of data mining.The paper also discusses why comparativeanalysis is more important in evaluating some types of algorithmsthan for others, and provides some suggestionsabout how to avoid the pitfalls suffered by many experimentalstudies.Keywords: classification, comparative studie...

Title: Fast Exact Multiplication by the Hessian
Abstract: Just storing the Hessian H (the matrix of second derivatives @2E=@w i @w j of the error Ewith respect to each pair of weights) of a large neural network isdifficult. Since a commonuse of a large matrix like H is to compute its product with variousvectors, we derive atechnique that directly calculates Hv, where v is an arbitraryvector. This allows H to betreated as a generalized sparse matrix. To calculate Hv, we firstdefine a differential operatorRff(w)g = (@=@r)f(w + rv)j r=0 , note that Rfr w g = Hv and Rfwg = v,and then applyRf\Deltag to the equations used to compute r w . The result is anexact and numerically stableprocedure for computing Hv, which takes about as much computation,and is about as local,as a gradient evaluation. We then apply the technique tobackpropagation network, recurrentbackpropagation, and stochastic Boltzmann Machines. Finally, we showthat this techniquecan be used at the heart of many iterative techniques for computingvarious proper...

We considera Laplace approximation and the less accurate but morecomputationally efficient approximationknown as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which isequivalent toRissanen's (1987) Minimum Description Length (MDL). Also, we considerapproximationsthat ignore some off-diagonal elements of the observed informationmatrix and anapproximation proposed by Cheeseman and Stutz (1995). We evaluate theaccuracy ofthese approximations using a Monte-Carlo gold standard.

Abstract: The paper describes simulations on populations of neural networksthat both evolve at thepopulation level and learn at the individual level. Unlike othersimulations, the evolutionary task(finding food in the environment) and the learning task (predictingthe next position of food onthe basis of present position and planned network's movement) aredifferent tasks. In theseconditions both learning influences evolution (without Lamarckianinheritance of learned weightchanges) and evolution influences learning. Average but not peakfitness has a betterevolutionary growth with learning than without learning. After theinitial generations individualsthat learn to predict during life also improve their food findingability during life. Furthermore,individuals which inherit an innate capacity to find food alsoinherit an innate predisposition tolearn to predict the sensory consequences of their movements. They donot predict better at birthbut they do learn to predict better than in...

Title: Flexible Discriminant Analysis by Optimal Scoring
Abstract: Fisher's linear discriminant analysis is a valuable tool formultigroupclassification. With a large number of predictors, one can finda reduced number of discriminant coordinate functions that are"optimal" for separating the groups. With two such functions one canproduce a classification map that partitions the reduced space intoregions that are identified with group membership, and the decisionboundaries are linear. This paper is about richer nonlinearclassificationschemes.Linear discriminant analysis is equivalent to multi-response linearregression using optimal scorings to represent the groups. We obtainnonparametric versions of discriminant analysis by replacing linearregression by any nonparametric regression method. In this way,any multi-response regression technique (such as MARS or neuralnetworks)can be post-processed to improve their classification performence.1 IntroductionMultigroup classification or discrimination is an important problemwithapplicati...

Abstract: . We describe two important sets of tools for neural networkmodeling:prediction risk estimation and network architecture selection.Prediction risk is definedas the expected performance of an estimator in predicting newobservations.Estimated prediction risk can be used both for estimating the qualityof model predictionsand for model selection. Prediction risk estimation and modelselection areespecially important for problems with limited data. Techniques forestimating predictionrisk include data resampling algorithms such as nonlinearcross--validation(NCV) and algebraic formulae such as the predicted squared error(PSE) and generalizedprediction error (GPE). We show that exhaustive search over the spaceof network architectures is computationally infeasible even fornetworks of modestsize. This motivates the use of heuristic strategies thatdramatically reduce the searchcomplexity. These strategies employ directed search algorithms, suchas selectingthe number of nodes...

Abstract: . The training problem for feedforward neural networks is nonlinearparameter estimationthat can be solved by a variety of optimization techniques. Much ofthe literature on neuralnetworks has focused on variants of gradient descent. The training ofneural networks using suchtechniques is known to be a slow process with more sophisticatedtechniques not always performingsignificantly better. In this paper, we show that feedforward neuralnetworks can have ill-conditionedHessians and that this ill-conditioning can be quite common. Theanalysis and experimental resultsin this paper lead to the conclusion that many network trainingproblems are ill-conditioned andmay not be solved more efficiently by higher-order optimizationmethods. While our analyses are forcompletely connected layered networks, they extend to networks withsparse connectivity as well.

GSAT can solve problem instances that are extremelydifficult for traditionalsatisfiability algorithms. Results suggest that SASAT scales upbetter as the number ofvariables increases, solving at least as many hard SAT problems withless effort. Thepaper then presents an ablation study that helps to explain therelative advantage ofSASAT over GSAT.

Abstract: Learning of continuous valued functions using neural networkensembles(committees) can give improved accuracy, reliable estimationof the generalization error, and active learning. The ambiguityis defined as the variation of the output of ensemble membersaveragedover unlabeled data, so it quantifies the disagreement amongthe networks. It is discussed how to use the ambiguity in combinationwith cross-validation to give a reliable estimate of the ensemblegeneralization error, and how this type of ensemble cross-validationcan sometimes improve performance. It is shown how to estimatethe optimal weights of the ensemble members using unlabeled data.By a generalization of query by committee, it is finally shown howthe ambiguity can be used to select new training data to be labeledin an active learning scheme.1 INTRODUCTIONIt is well known that a combination of many different predictors canimprove predictions.In the neural networks community "ensembles" of neuralnetworks h...

Title: Explanation-Based Neural Network Learning for Robot Control
Abstract: How can artificial neural nets generalize better from fewer examples?In orderto generalize successfully, neural network learning methods typicallyrequirelarge training data sets. We introduce a neural network learningmethod thatgeneralizes rationally from many fewer data points, relying insteadon priorknowledge encoded in previously learned neural networks. For example,in robotcontrol learning tasks reported here, previously learned networksthat model theeffects of robot actions are used to guide subsequent learning ofrobot controlfunctions. For each observed training example of the target function(e.g. therobot control policy), the learner explains the observed example interms of itsprior knowledge, then analyzes this explanation to infer additionalinformationabout the shape, or slope, of the target function. This shapeknowledge is used tobias generalization in the learned target function. Results arepresented applyingthis approach to a simulated robot task based on reinforcementlearning.

Title: Selecting input variables using mutual information and nonparametric density estimation
Abstract: In learning problems where a connectionist network is trained with afinite sized trainingset, better generalization performance is often obtained whenunneeded weights in the networkare eliminated. One source of unneeded weights comes from theinclusion of inputvariables that provide little information about the output variables.We propose a methodfor identifying and eliminating these input variables. The methodfirst determines the relationshipbetween input and output variables using nonparametric densityestimation andthen measures the relevance of input variables using the informationtheoretic concept ofmutual information. We present results from our method on a simpletoy problem and anonlinear time series.1 INTRODUCTIONGeneralization performance on a fixed-size training set is closelyrelated to the number of free parametersin a network. Selecting too many free parameters can lead to poorgeneralization performance (Baum &Haussler, 1989; Geman, Bienenstock, & Dours...

Abstract: A visual attention system, inspired by the behavior and the neuronalarchitecture of the early primate visual system, is presented.Multiscale image features are combined into a single topographicalsaliency map.

Title: Air quality prediction in Milan: feed-forward neural networks, pruned neural networks and lazy learning. Ecological Modelling 185
Abstract: Ozone and PM10 constitute the major concern for air quality of Milan. This paper addresses the problem of the prediction of such two pollutants, using to this end several statistical approaches. In particular, feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs), currently recognized as state-of-the-art ap-proach for statistical prediction of air quality, are compared with two alternative approaches de-rived from machine learning: pruned neural networks (PNNs) and lazy learning (LL). PNNs con-stitute a parameter-parsimonious approach, based on the removal of redundant parameters from fully connected neural networks; LL, on the other hand, is a local linear prediction algorithm, which performs a local learning procedure each time a prediction is required. All the three ap-proaches are tested in the prediction of ozone and PM10; predictors are trained to return at 9 a.m. the concentration estimated for the current day. No strong differences are found between the forecast accuracies of the different models; never-theless, LL provides the best performances on indicators related to average goodness of the predic-tion (correlation, mean absolute error, etc.), while PNNs are superior to the other approaches in de-tecting of the exceedances of alarm and attention thresholds. In some cases, data-deseasonalization is found to improve the prediction accuracy of the models. Finally, some striking features of lazy learning deserve consideration: the LL predictor can be quickly designed, and, thanks to the simplicity of the local linear regressors, it both gets rid of overfitting problems and can be readily interpreted; moreover, it can be also easily kept up-to-date.

Title: Characterizing Self-Developing Biological Neural Networks: A First Step Towards their Application To Computing Systems
Abstract: . Carbon nanotubes are often seen as the only alternative technology to silicon transistors. While they are the most likely short-term alternative, other longer-term alternatives should be studied as well, even if their properties are less familiar to chip designers. While contemplating biological neurons as an alternative component may seem preposterous at first sight, significant recent progress in CMOS-neuron interface suggests this direction may not be unrealistic; moreover, biological neurons are known to self-assemble into very large networks capable of complex information processing tasks, something that has yet to be achieved with other emerging technologies. The first step to designing computing systems on top of biological neurons is to build an abstract model of selfassembled biological neural networks, much like computer architects manipulate abstract models of transistors and circuits. In this article, we propose a first model of the structure of biological neural networks. We provide empirical evidence that this model matches the biological neural networks found in living organisms, and exhibits the smallworld graph structure properties commonly found in many large and self-organized systems, including biological neural networks. More importantly, we extract the simple local rules and characteristics governing the growth of such networks, enabling the development of potentially large but realistic biological neural networks, as would be needed for complex information processing/computing tasks. Based on this model, future work will be targeted to understanding the evolution and learning properties of such networks, and how they can be used to build computing systems. 1

Title: Random early detection gateways for congestion avoidance
Abstract: This paper presents Random Early Detection (RED) gateways forcongestion avoidance in packetswitchednetworks. The gateway detects incipient congestion by computing theaverage queue size. Thegateway could notify connections of congestion either by droppingpackets arriving at the gateway orby setting a bit in packet headers. When the average queue sizeexceeds a preset threshold, the gatewaydrops or marks each arriving packet with a certain probability, wherethe exact probability is a functionof the average queue size.RED gateways keep the average queue size low while allowingoccasional bursts of packets in thequeue. During congestion, the probability that the gateway notifies aparticular connection to reduceits window is roughly proportional to that connection's share of thebandwidth through the gateway.RED gateways are designed to accompany a transport-layer congestioncontrol protocol such as TCP.The RED gateway has no bias against bursty traffic and avoids theglobal ...

This paper presents a performance evaluation ofTreadMarks running onUltrix using DECstation-5000/240's that are connected by a 100-Mbpsswitch-based ATM LANand a 10-Mbps Ethernet. Our objective is to determine the efficiencyof a user-level DSM implementationon commercially available workstations and operating systems.We achieved good speedups on the 8-processor ATM network for Jacobi(7.4), TSP (7.2), Quicksort(6.3), and ILINK (5.7). For a slightly modified version of Water fromthe SPLASH benchmarksuite, we achieved only moderate speedups (4.0) due to the highcommunication and synchronizationrate. Speedups decline on the 10-Mbps Ethernet (5.5 for Jacobi, 6.5for TSP, 4.2 forQuicksort, 5.1 for ILINK, and 2.1 for Water), reflecting thebandwidth limitations of the Ethernet.These results support the contention that, with suitable networkingtechnology, DSM is aviable te...

Title: The design philosophy of the DARPA internet protocols
Abstract: The Internet protocol suite, TCP/IP, was first proposed fifteen yearsago. It was developed by the Defense Advanced Research ProjectsAgency (DARPA), and has been used widely in military and commercialsystems. While there have been papers and specifications thatdescribe how the protocols work, it is sometimes difficult to deducefrom these why the protocol is as it is. For example, the Internetprotocol is based on a connectionless or datagram mode of service.The motivation for this has been greatly misunderstood. This paperattempts to capture some of the early reasoning which shaped theInternet protocols. 1.

Title: Congestion Avoidance in Computer Networks with a Connectionless Network Layer: Concepts,
Abstract: Widespread use of computer networks and the use of varied technologyfor the interconnection of computers has made congestion asignificant problem. In this report, we summarize our research oncongestion avoidance. We compare the concept of congestion avoidancewith that of congestion control. Briefly, congestion control is arecovery mechanism, while congestion avoidance is a preventionmechanism. A congestion control scheme helps the network to recoverfrom the congestion state while a congestion avoidance scheme allowsa network to operate in the region of low delay and high throughputwith minimal queuing, thereby preventing it from entering thecongested state in which packets are lost due to buffer shortage. Anumber of possible alternatives for congestion avoidance wereidentified. From these alternatives we selected one called the binaryfeedback scheme in which the network uses a single bit in the networklayer header to feed back the congestion information to its users,whic...

Title: A Delay Based Approach for Congestion Avoidance in Interconnected Heterogeneous Computer Networks
Abstract: In heterogeneous networks, achieving congestion avoidance isdifficult because the congestion feedback from one subnetwork mayhave no meaning to sources on other subnetworks. We propose usingchanges in round-trip delay as an implicit feedback. Using ablack-box model of the network, we derive an expression for theoptimal window as a function of the gradient of the delay-windowcurve. The problems of selfish optimum and social optimum are alsoaddressed. It is shown that without a careful design, it is possibleto get into a race condition during heavy congestion, where each userwants more resources than others, thereby leading to a divergingcondition. It is shown that congestion avoidance using round-tripdelay is a promising approach. The approach has the advantage thatthere is absolutely no overhead for the network itself. It isexemplified by a simple scheme. The performance of the scheme isanalyzed using a simulation model. The scheme is shown to beefficient, fair, conver...

Title: Improving Reliable Transport and Handoff Performance in Cellular Wireless Networks
Abstract: TCP is a reliable transport protocol tuned to perform well intraditional networks where congestion is the primarycause of packet loss. However, networks with wireless links andmobile hosts incur significant losses due to biterrorsand handoff. This environment violates many of the assumptions madeby TCP, causing degraded end-toendperformance. In this paper, we describe the additions andmodifications to the standard Internet protocol stack(TCP/IP) to improve end-to-end reliable transport performance inmobile environments. The protocol changes aremade to network-layer software at the base station and mobile host,and preserve the end-to-end semantics of TCP.One part of the modifications, called the snoop module, cachespackets at the base station and performs localretransmissions across the wireless link to alleviate the problemscaused by high bit-error rates. The second part isa routing protocol that enables low-latency handoff to occur withnegligible data loss. We have im...

Title: Data Networks as Cascades: Investigating the Multifractal Nature of Internet WAN Traffic
Abstract: In apparent contrast to the well-documented self-similar (i.e.,monofractal) scaling behavior of measured LAN traffic, recentstudies have suggested that measured TCP/IP andATM WAN traffic exhibits more complex scaling behavior,consistent with multifractals. To bring multifractals intothe realm of networking, this paper provides a simple constructionbased on cascades (also known as multiplicativeprocesses) that is motivated by the protocol hierarchy of IPdata networks. The cascade framework allows for a plausiblephysical explanation of the observed multifractal scalingbehavior of data traffic and suggests that the underlyingmultiplicative structure is a traffic invariant for WAN trafficthat co-exists with self-similarity. In particular, cascades allowus to refine the previously observed self-similar nature ofdata traffic to account for local irregularities in WAN trafficthat are typically associated with networking mechanismsoperating on small time scales, such as TCP fl...

Title: Comparative performance analysis of versions of TCP in a local network with a lossy link
Abstract: The scenario is that a bulk data transfer is being performed overa TCP connection, from a host on a local area network (LAN) to amobile host attached to the LAN by a radio link. In earlier work[10] we had assumed that packet losses in a TCP connection overa radio link are statistically independent. In this paper, we extendthis analysis to a Rayleigh fading link, which we model by a twostate Markov model. The bulk throughputs of TCP-OldTahoe andTCP-Tahoe are compared with and without fading, for various averagesignal-to-noise ratios. We also study the performance with a linkprotocol on the wireless link, and study the effect of varying thelinkpacket size, the number of link packet attempts, and the vehiclespeed.For the parameters of the BSD UNIX implementation, over a 1.5Mbpswireless link, we find that, with fading, a signal-to-noise ratio ofatleast 30dB is required to get reasonable throughput with TCP Tahoeor OldTahoe; this corresponds to at least 100 ti...

For networks such as thosebased on AsynchronousTransfer Mode (ATM), these service requirements are specified throughQuality of Service (QoS)parameters. QoS guarantees are needed at multiple layers in anend-to-end protocol architecture.Delivering end-to-end QoS requires an architecture for resourcemanagement at the systemend-points (e.g., computer workstation hosts), as well as in theunderlying network.We describe a model for an end-point entity called the QoS Broker.The broker orchestratesresources at the end-points, coordinating resource management acrosslayer boundaries.

Title: A Proposal for a new KQML Specification
Abstract: We propose a new specification for the Knowledge Query andManipulation Language(KQML). KQML is a language for the communication between softwareagents. KQML offers a variety of message types (performatives) thatexpressan attitude regarding the content of the exchange. Performatives canalso assistagents in finding other agents that can process their requests. Ourstarting pointfor the specification of KQML is [1]. Although the differencesregarding the syntaxof KQML messages and the reserved performative parameters areminimal,there are significant changes regarding the set of reservedperformatives, theirmeaning and intended use.Note: This document is not the official new KQML specification. It isintendedas a proposal for a new KQML specification and the authors welcomesany comments.Contents1 KQML transport assumptions 12 KQML string syntax 23 Reserved performative parameters 34 The reserved performatives 54.1 Discourse performatives . . . . . . . . . . . . . ....

Title: Analysis of Techniques to Improve Protocol Processing Latency
Abstract: This paper describes several techniques designed to improveprotocol latency, and reports on their effectiveness whenmeasured on a modern RISC machine employing the DECAlpha processor. We found that the memory system---whichhas long been known to dominate network throughput---isalso a key factor in protocol latency. As a result, improvinginstruction cache effectiveness can greatly reduce protocolprocessing overheads. An important metric in this context isthe memory cycles per instructions (mCPI), which is the averagenumber of cycles that an instruction stalls waiting fora memory access to complete. The techniques presented inthis paper reduce the mCPI by a factor of 1.35 to 5.8. In analyzingthe effectiveness of the techniques, we also presenta detailed study of the protocol processing behavior of twoprotocol stacks---TCP/IP and RPC---on a modern RISC processor.1 IntroductionCommunication latency is often just as important as throughputin distributed systems, and for t...

Title: System Architecture Directions for Networked Sensors
Abstract: Technological progress in integrated, low-power, CMOS communicationdevices and sensors makes a rich design space of networked sensorsviable. They can be deeply embedded in the physical world and spreadthroughout our environment like smart dust. The missing elements arean overall system architecture and a methodology for systematicadvance. To this end, we identify key requirements, develop a smalldevice that is representative of the class, design a tinyevent-driven operating system, and show that it provides support forefficient modularity and concurrency-intensive operation. Ouroperating system fits in 178 bytes of memory, propagates events inthe time it takes to copy 1.25 bytes of memory, context switches inthe time it takes to copy 6 bytes of memory and supports two levelscheduling. The analysis lays a groundwork for future architecturaladvances.

In thistwo-part report, we investigate the eects that link breakage due tomobility has on TCP performance.Through simulation, we show that TCP throughput drops signicantlywhen nodes movebecause of TCP's inability to recognize the dierence between linkfailure and congestion. We alsoanalyze specic examples, such as a situation where throughput iszero for a particular connection.We introduce a new metric, expected throughput, for the comparison ofthroughput in multi-hopnetworks, and then use this metric to show how the use of explicitlink failure notication (ELFN)techniques can signicantly improve TCP performance. In Part I ofthis report, we presented theproblem and an analysis of the simulation results. In this paper(Part II of the report), we presentthe simulation in more detail and provide additional results.Keywords: Mobile Ad Hoc Networks, TCP/IP, Performance Analysis,Explicit Link Failure Notication(ELFN), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR)This work was supported in part by the Department of Education underAward No. P200A80305, the National Science Foundationunder Grant No. 32525-46600, and the Texas Advanced TechnologyProgram under Grant No. 010115-248.1

Title: Communication Issues in Parallel Computing Across ATM Networks
Abstract: Cluster-based computing, which exploits the aggregate power ofnetworked collectionsof computers, has drawn increasing attention in the parallelprocessing community.The success of cluster-based computing depends largely on theperformance of the underlyingnetwork. Although Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) was designedspecificallyto transport integrated multimedia data, the expected ubiquity ofsuch networks willlead to their use for a wide variety of applications, includingparallel processing. WhileATM networks offer a high-performance communications infrastructure,they must beaccompanied by communications software designed to meet the specificneeds of parallelapplications. This paper is intended to put forward the issuesinvolved in parallel computingacross ATM networks and to describe some of the solutions to theaccompanyingcommunication problems.

Using this server OS, we have constructed an HTTP server thatoutperforms servers running on a conventionalOS by more than an order of magnitude and that can safely timesharethe hardware platform with other applications.1 IntroductionServers, the foundations of the client/server model of computing, arerapidly becoming more critical.

Title: A Wireless Broadband Ad-Hoc ATM Local-Area Network
Abstract: this paper, the exact method by which the look-up table is generatedis not important.In this section we are interested in the updates to the routingtables at each PBS in theK. Y. Eng et al. / A Wireless Broadband Ad-Hoc ATM Local-Area Network17case of a failure. A tree and a routing table is shown in Fig. 13.First, we would like to illustrate that in the case of a linkfailure, updating the routingtables at the affected transmitter node is not sufficient. This isshown in Fig. 14 for therouting tree of Fig. 13. When the affected PBS reroutes traffic asshown, a cycle isgenerated in the tree, since the traffic is deflected to a PBS thattransmits incoming cellsback to the affected PBS in accordance with the original treedesignation. Although froma simplicity viewpoint, regular deflection networking would bedesirable in this network,it does not work since deflection routing works well only fornetworks with regulartopologies, but for networks with arbitrary topologies, such as ours,it does not work.The optimum remedy to the problem is in calculating the optimum treeas if the failedlink were disconnected, and updating the routing tables at each PBS.Various centralizedor distributed algorithms exist for this purpose. Without gettinginto algorithm specifics,we describe centralized and distributed alternatives below.The first issue is the detection of failure. In the case of fullduplex links, the failure isdetected by both ends of the link failure. However, common failuresinvolve transmitterand receiver failures in the case of optical links, and it istherefore safe to conclude thatthe failures should be detected by the receiving PBS. The secondissue is the propagationof this information to the agent that will make the reroutingdecision. In ...

Title: A Mobile Host Protocol Supporting Route Optimization and Authentication
Abstract: Host mobility is becoming an important issue due to the recentproliferation of notebook andpalmtop computers, the development of wireless network interfaces,and the growth in globalinternetworking. This paper describes the design and implementationof a mobile host protocol,called the Internet Mobile Host Protocol (IMHP), that is compatiblewith the TCP/IP protocolsuite, and allows a mobile host to move around the Internet withoutchanging its identity. Inparticular, IMHP provides host mobility over both the local and widearea, while remainingtransparent to the user and to other hosts communicating with themobile host.IMHP features route optimization and integrated authentication of allmanagement packets.Route optimization allows a node to cache the location of a mobilehost and to send futurepackets directly to that mobile host. By authenticating allmanagement packets, IMHP guardsagainst possible attacks on packet routing to mobile hosts, includingthe interception or ...

Title: Defending Against Denial of Service Attacks in Scout
Abstract: We describe a two-dimensional architecture for defendingagainst denial of service attacks. In one dimension, the architectureaccounts for all resources consumed by each I/Opath in the system; this accounting mechanism is implementedas an extension to the path object in the Scout operatingsystem. In the second dimension, the various modulesthat define each path can be configured in separate protectiondomains; we implement hardware enforced protectiondomains, although other implementations are possible.The resulting system---which we call Escort---is the firstexample of a system that simultaneously does end-to-endresource accounting (thereby protecting against denial ofservice attacks) and supports multiple protection domains(thereby allowing untrusted modules to be isolated fromeach other).

Title: Measuring the Performance of Communication Middleware on High-Speed Networks
Abstract: Conventional implementations of communication middleware(such as CORBA and traditional RPC toolkits) incurconsiderable overhead when used for performance-sensitiveapplications over high-speed networks. As gigabit networksbecome pervasive, inefficient middleware will force programmersto use lower-level mechanisms to achieve the necessarytransfer rates, which is a serious problem for mission/lifecriticalapplications (such as satellite surveillance and medicalimaging).This paper presents results comparing the performance ofseveral widely used communication middleware mechanismson a high-speed ATM network. The middleware ranged fromlower-level mechanisms (such as socket-based C interfacesand C++ wrappers for sockets) to higher-level mechanisms(such as hand-optimized RPC and two implementations ofCORBA -- Orbix and ORBeline). These measurements revealthat the lower-level C and C++ implementations outperformthe CORBA implementations significantly (the best CORBAthroughput f...

Title: TCP Extensions for Space Communications
Abstract: The space communication environment and mobile and wirelesscommunication environments show many similarities when observedfrom the perspective of a transport protocol. Both types ofenvironments exhibit loss caused by data corruption and linkoutage, in addition to congestion-related loss. The constraintsimposed by the two environments are also similar --- power,weight, and physical volume of equipment are scarce resources.Finally, it is not uncommon for communication channel data ratesto be severely limited and highly asymmetric. We are working onsolutions to these types of problems for space communicationenvironments, and we believe that these solutions may be applicableto the mobile and wireless community. As part of our work,we have defined and implemented the Space CommunicationsProtocol Standards-Transport Protocol (SCPS-TP), a set of extensionsto TCP that address the problems that we have identified.The results of our performance tests, both in the laboratory andon...

Title: Lazy Receiver Processing (LRP): A Network Subsystem Architecture for Server Systems
Abstract: The explosive growth of the Internet, the widespread useof WWW-related applications, and the increased relianceon client-server architectures places interesting new demandson network servers.

Title: DPF: Fast, Flexible Message Demultiplexing Using Dynamic Code Generation
Abstract: Fast and flexible message demultiplexing are well-established goalsin the networking community [1, 18, 22]. Currently, however, networkarchitects have had to sacrifice one for the other. We presenta new packet-filter system, DPF (Dynamic Packet Filters), thatprovidesboth the traditional flexibility of packet filters [18] and thespeed of hand-crafted demultiplexing routines [3]. DPF filters run10--50 times faster than the fastest packet filters reported in theliterature [1, 17, 18, 27]. DPF's performance is either equivalentto or, when it can exploit runtime information, superior to handcodeddemultiplexors. DPF achieves high performance by using acarefully-designed declarative packet-filter language that isaggressivelyoptimized using dynamic code generation. The contributionsof this work are: (1) a detailed description of the DPF design, (2)discussion of the use of dynamic code generation and quantitativeresults on its performance impact, (3) quantitative results on how...

Abstract: In this paper, we report on some preliminary results from anin-depth, wavelet-based analysisof a set of high-quality, packet-level traffic measurements,collected over the last 6-7 years from anumber of different working wide-area networks (WANs).

We then relatethis large-time scaling phenomenonto the empirically observed characteristics of WAN traffic at thelevel of individual connections orapplications. In particular, we present here original results about adetailed statistical analysis ofWeb-session characteristics, and report on an intriguing scalingproperty of measured WAN trafficat the transport layer (i.e., number of TCP connection arrivals pertime unit). This scaling propertyof WAN traffic at the TCP layer was absent in the pre-Web period buthas become ubiquitous intod...

While the implementation has onlyrecently become operational, we already observe acceptablecommunications throughput. We make careful use of theStandard ML modules system, with the core component ofthe implementation being a signature which is generic toall communications protocols. This generic protocol is thenspecialized for specific protocols, and these are implementedby functors parameterized by generic protocols. This leadsnaturally to a layered system structure and also provides animportant and useful "mix-and-match" capability incomposingprotocols into complex networking systems.We have found the advanced fea...

Abstract: Protocol and operating system overheads have become the limitingfactor for communicationsperformance on fast networks such as ATM. A large component of theseoverheads stems from theprotocol redundancy that arises when layering higher level protocolson top of lower level ones. ATM,for example, requires specific mechanisms for connection management,flow control, congestionavoidance, and segmentation and reassembly. With these mechanisms inplace, it is relatively simpleand inexpensive to provide for reliable sequenced delivery at thenetwork interface level, makingsimilar functionality in higher-level protocols such as TCP/IPredundant. In this paper we present aprotocol architecture specifically tailored for communication overhigh-bandwidth low-latency localor metropolitan ATM networks. Our architecture yields highperformance by eliminating protocolredundancy and by exploiting common-case communication behavior. Withthis approach, wecan combine the functionality typica...

Title: Optimizing TCP forwarder performance
Abstract: A TCP forwarder is a network node that establishes and forwards databetween a pair of TCP connections. Anexample of a TCP forwarder is a firewall that places a proxy betweena TCP connection to an external host and aTCP connection to an internal host, controlling access to a resourceon the internal host. Once the proxy approvesthe access, it simply forwards data from one connection to the other.We use the term TCP forwarding to describeindirect TCP communication via a proxy in general. This papercharacterizes the behavior of TCP forwarding, andillustrates the role TCP forwarding plays in common network serviceslike firewalls and HTTP proxies. We introducean optimization technique, called connection splicing, that can beapplied to a TCP forwarder, and report the resultsof a performance study designed to evaluate its impact. Connectionsplicing improves TCP forwarding performanceby a factor of two to four, making it competitive with IP routerperformance on the same...

It also gives case studies tohelp illustrate the capabilities and usefulness of the simulator.Finally, we consider a set of basic simulation principlesin the context of running network simulations, giving a set ofconcrete guidelines and, most importantly, providing examplesto help quantify the value of these principles as well asthe cost of ignoring them.1 IntroductionWe are on the brink of a new era in networking.

Title: On Predictable Operating System Protocol Processing
Abstract: Distributed continuous media applications that incorporate digitalaudio and video require predictableresponse from the operating system and the network. Much recentresearch in communication networksfocuses on providing predictable service at the network level, butcurrent operating systems do nottypically provide end-to-end predictability. Our aim is to offeroperating system support for predictabilitywhile still maintaining the dynamic, easy-to-use environment of ageneral purpose operating system.We explore the use of a resource reservation mechanism in theoperating system with the idea thatthis mechanism can be used to support higher level quality of servicemanagement policies. We alsoemploy a protocol software structure that uses priorities, preemptivepacket servicing, and reservationenforcement to allow the reservation scheduling policy to makefine-grained scheduling decisions tocontrol the protocol processing activities.

Title: Low-Loss TCP/IP Header Compression for Wireless Networks
Abstract: Wireless is becoming a popular way to connect mobilecomputers to the Internet and other networks. Thebandwidth of wireless links will probably always be limiteddue to properties of the physical medium and regulatorylimits on the use of frequencies for radio communication.Therefore, it is necessary for network protocolsto utilize the available bandwidth efficiently.Headers of IP packets are growing and the bandwidthrequired for transmitting headers is increasing. With thecoming of IPv6 the address size increases from 4 to 16bytes and the basic IP header increases from 20 to 40bytes. Moreover, most mobility schemes tunnel packetsaddressed to mobile hosts by adding an extra IP headeror extra routing information, typically increasing thesize of TCP/IPv4 headers to 60 bytes and TCP/IPv6headers to 100 bytes.In this paper, we provide new header compressionschemes for UDP/IP and TCP/IP protocols. We showhow to reduce the size of UDP/IP headers by an orderof magnitude, down t...

Title: Protocol boosters
Abstract: This paper describes a new methodology for protocol design, usingincrementalconstruction of the protocol from elements called "protocolboosters" on an as-neededbasis. Protocol boosters allow: (1) dynamic protocol customization toheterogeneousenvironments, and (2) rapid protocol evolution.Unlike alternative adaptation approaches, such as link layer,conversion, andtermination protocols, protocol boosters are both robust (end-to-endprotocol messagesare not modified) and maximize efficiency (does not replicate thefunctionality of theend-to-end protocol). We give examples of error and congestioncontrol boosters andgive initial results from booster implementations.1 Introduction and Problem StatementAt the heart of the success and power of the worldwide IP Internetare the general purposeprotocols in the TCP/IP protocol suite.

Title: TCP over wireless with link level error control: analysis and design methodology
Abstract: The anticipated emergence of mobile computing depends on the abilityto support data applicationsover heterogeneous networks comprising both wireless and wirelinelinks. Standard data applications oncurrent wireline networks are based on TCP/IP. However TCP performspoorly over lossy wireless linkssubject to deep fades and other impairments may be unsatisfactory.One approach to this problem is to usesuitable link level error recovery mechanism that can"hide" the fluctuations of the wireless medium fromTCP. In this paper, we provide an analytical framework forquantifying the performance of TCP operatingover wireless link (with retransmission based link level errorrecovery) as a function of the wireless channelcharacteristics, the size of the wireless-wireline interface buffer,and the bandwidth-delay product of theconnection. While our design methodology is of general applicability,we demonstrate it for the specificcase of a Rayleigh fading link, since Rayleigh fading is o...

Title: Freeze-TCP: A True End-to-End TCP Enhancement Mechanism for Mobile Environments
Abstract: Optimizing TCP (Transport Layer) for mobility has been researchedextensively. We present a brief summary of existing results whichindicates that most schemes require intermediaries (such as basestations)to monitor the TCP traffic and actively participate in flow controlin orderto enhance performance. Although these methods simulate end-to-endsemantics,they do not comprise true end-to-end signaling. As a result, thesetechniques are not applicable when the IP payload is encrypted. ForinstanceIPSEC, which is expected to be standard under IPv6, encrypts theentire IP payload making it impossible for intermediaries to monitorTCPtraffic unless those entities are part of the security association.In addition,these schemes require changes (in the TCP/IP code) at intermediatenodesmaking it difficult for the mobile clients to inter-operate with theexistinginfrastructure.

SML supports higher-orderfunctions, modularity, and type-safe module composition.We find that by using SML we can achieve good structure andgood performance simultaneously. Good structure includesa modular decomposition of the protocol stack and of theTCP implementation, a control structure that imposes a totalordering on all events and processes them synchronously,and a test structure that allows component testing to catchproblems before system integration. Strategies that helpachieve good performance include using fast algorithms, usinglanguage constructs that make it easy to stage functionevaluation, and language implementation features such ascompacting garbage collection.1 IntroductionThe design of programming languages has made great stridesin the past twenty years.

Abstract: The implementation of protocols, such as TCP/IP, and theirintegration into the operatingsystem environment is very decisive for protocol performance. PuttingTCP on high-speednetworks, e.g. ATM, with large maximum transmission units causes theTCP maximumsegment size to be relatively large. What Nagle's algorithm considera "small" segment is notsmall any more which affects the TCP performance. We report on TCP/IPthroughput and RPCresponse time performance measurements for various sizes of send andreceive socket buffers,using the Sparc10 architecture machines Axil 311/5.1 running SunOS4.1.3 connected to FORESystem's ATM network. For some common combinations of socket buffersizes we observe adramatic performance degradation to less than 1% of expectedthroughput and to one order-ofmagnitudelonger response time than expected.

Title: Protocol Architecture for Multimedia Applications Over ATM Networks
Abstract: At the data-link layer, ATM offers a number of features, such ashigh-bandwidth andper-connection quality of service (QoS) guarantees, making itparticularly attractive to multimediaapplications. Unfortunately, many of these features are not visibleto applicationsbecause of the inadequacies of existing higher-level protocolarchitectures. Although a considerableeffort is underway to tune these protocols for ATM networks, webelieve that anew ATM specific protocol stack is essential to effectively exploitall the benefits of ATM.In this paper we describe the semantics of such a protocol stack, anddiscuss its advantagesover traditional protocol architectures from the perspective ofdistributed multimediaapplications. The performance impact of the new protocol architectureis experimentallydemonstrated on a video conferencing testbed built around IBMRS/6000s equipped withprototype hardware for video/audio processing, and connected via ATMlinks.IBM Thomas J.

Title: The Design and Performance of a Real-Time I/O Subsystem
Abstract: To be an effective platform for performance-sensitive realtimeand embedded applications, off-the-shelf OO middlewarelike CORBA, DCOM, and Java RMI must preservecommunication-layer quality of service (QoS) properties toapplications end-to-end. However, conventional OO middlewareinteroperability protocols, such as CORBA's GIOP/IIOPor DCOM's MS-RPC, are not well suited for applications thatcannot tolerate the message footprint size, latency, and jitterassociated with general-purpose messaging and transportprotocols.

Abstract: . In current Java implementations, Remote Method Invocation(RMI) is too slow, especially for high performance computing.

Moreover, the re-designed RMI supportsnonTCP/IP communication networks, even with heterogeneous transportprotocols. We demonstrate that for high performance computing some ofthe official serialization's generality can and should be traded forspeed.As a by-product, a benchmark collection for RMI is presented.On PCs connected through Ethernet, the better serialization and theimproved RMI save a median of 45% (maximum of 71%) of the runtimefor some set of arguments.

Title: A dynamic adaptive acknowledgment strategy for TCP over multihop wireless networks
Abstract: Multihop wireless networks based on the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol are promising for ad hoc networks in small scale today. The 802.11 protocol minimizes the well-known hidden node problem but does not eliminate it completely. Consequently, the end-to-end bandwidth utilization may be quite poor if the involved protocols do not interact smoothly. In particular, the TCP protocol does not manage to obtain efficient bandwidth utilization because its congestion control mechanism is not tailored to such a complex environment. The main problems with TCP in such networks are the excessive amount of both spurious retransmissions and contentions between data and acknowledgement (ACK) packets for the transmission medium. In this paper, we propose a dynamic adaptive strategy for minimizing the number of ACK packets in transit and mitigating spurious retransmissions. Using this strategy, the receiver adjusts itself to the wireless channel condition by delaying more packets when the channel is in good condition and less otherwise. Our technique not only improves bandwidth utilization but also reduces power consumption by retransmitting much less than a regular TCP does. Extensive simulation evaluations show that our scheme provides very good enhancements in a variety of scenarios.

Title: Compiling Polymorphism Using Intensional Type Analysis
Abstract: Types have been used to describe the size and shape of datastructures at compile time. In polymorphic languages or languageswith abstract types, this is not possible since the types of someobjects are not known at compile time. Consequently, mostimplementations of polymorphic languages box data (i.e., represent anobject as a pointer), leading to inefficiencies. We introduce a newcompilation method for polymorphic languages that avoids the problemsassociated with boxing data. The fundamental idea is to relax therequirement that code selection for primitive, polymorphicoperations, such as pairing and projection, must be performed atcompile time. Instead, we allow such operations to defer codeselection until link- or even run-time when the types of the valuesare known. We formalize our approach as a translation into anexplicitly-typed, predicative polymorphic - calculus with intensionalpolymorphism.

Abstract: This paper describes a memory management discipline for programsthat perform dynamic memory allocation and de-allocation. At runtime,all values are put into regions. The store consists of a stack ofregions.All points of region allocation and deallocation are inferredautomatically,using a type and effect based program analysis. The scheme does notassume the presence of a garbage collector.The scheme was first presented by Tofte and Talpin (1994);subsequently,it has been tested in The ML Kit with Regions, a region-based,garbage-collection free implementation of the Standard ML Corelanguage,which includes recursive datatypes, higher-order functions andupdatablereferences (Birkedal et al. 96, Elsman and Hallenberg 95).This paper defines a region-based dynamic semantics for a skeletalprogramminglanguage extracted from Standard ML. We present the inferencesystem which specifies where regions can be allocated andde-allocated anda detailed proof that the system is sound wi...

Title: Pointer Swizzling at Page Fault Time: Efficiently and Compatibly Supporting Huge Address Spaces on Standard Hardware
Abstract: Pointer swizzling at page fault time is a noveladdress translation mechanism that exploits conventionaladdress translation hardware. It can supporthuge address spaces efficiently without long hardwareaddresses; such large address spaces are attractive forpersistent object stores, distributed shared memories,and shared address space operating systems. Thisswizzling scheme can be used to provide data compatibilityacross machines with different word sizes,and even to provide binary code compatibility acrossmachines with different hardware address sizes.Pointers are translated ("swizzled") from a long formatto a shorter hardware-supported format at pagefault time. No extra hardware is required, and no continualsoftware overhead is incurred by presence checksor indirection of pointers. This pagewise technique exploitstemporal and spatial locality in much the sameway as a normal virtual memory; this gives it manydesirable performance characteristics, especially giventhe tr...

Title: A Prolog technology theorem prover: Implementation by an extended Prolog compiler
Abstract: A Prolog technology theorem prover (PTTP) is an extension of Prologthat is completefor the full first-order predicate calculus. It differs from Prologin its use of unificationwith the occurs check for soundness, the model-elimination reductionrule that is added toProlog inferences to make the inference system complete, anddepth-first iterative-deepeningsearch instead of unbounded depth-first search to make the searchstrategy complete. AProlog technology theorem prover has been implemented by an extendedProlog-to-LISPcompiler that supports these additional features. It is capable ofproving theorems in thefull first-order predicate calculus at a rate of thousands ofinferences per second.1This is a revised and expanded version of a paper presented at the8th International Conference onAutomated Deduction, Oxford, England, July 1986, and is to appear inJournal of Automated Reasoning.This research was supported by the Defense Advanced Research ProjectsAgency under Co...

Title: Application-controlled physical memory using external page-cache management
Abstract: Next generation computer systems will have gigabytesof physical memory and processors in the 200 MIPS rangeor higher.

Title: Software Write Detection for a Distributed Shared Memory
Abstract: Most software-based distributed shared memory (DSM) systems rely onthe operating system's virtual memory interface to detect writes toshared data. Strategies based on virtual memory page protectioncreate two problems for a DSM system. First, writes can have highoverhead since they are detected with a page fault. As a result, apage must be writtenmany times to amortize the cost of that fault.Second, the size of a virtual memory page is too big to serve as aunit of coherency, inducing false sharing. Mechanisms to handle falsesharing can increase runtime overhead and may cause data to beunnecessarily communicated between processors. In this paper, wepresent a new method for write detection that solves these problems.Our method relies on the compiler and runtime system to detect writesto shared data without invoking the operating system. We measure andcompare implementations of a distributed shared memory system usingboth strategies, virtual memory and compiler /runtime, runn...

Title: Simple Generational Garbage Collection and Fast Allocation
Abstract: Generational garbage collection algorithms achieve efficiency becausenewer records point to older records; the only way an older recordcan point to a newer record is by a store operation to apreviously-created record, and such operations are rare in manylanguages. A garbage collector that concentrates just on recentlyallocated records can take advantage of this fact. Such a garbagecollector can be so efficient that the allocation of records costsmore than their disposal. A scheme for quick record allocationattacks this bottleneck. Many garbage-collected environments don'tknow when to ask the operating system for more memory. A robustheuristic solves this problem. This paper presents a simple,efficient, low-overhead version of generational garbage collectionwith fast allocation, suitable for implementation in a Unixenvironment.

Title: Lazy Replication: Exploiting the Semantics of Distributed Services
Abstract: To provide high availability for services such as mail or bulletinboards, data must be replicated. One way to guarantee consistency ofreplicated data is to force service operations to occur in the sameorder at all sites, but this approach is expensive. In this paper, wepropose lazy replication as a way to preserve consistency byexploiting the semantics of the service's operations to relax theconstraints on ordering. Three kinds of operations are supported:operations for which the clients define the required orderdynamically during the execution, operations for which the servicedefines the order, and operations that must be globally ordered withrespect to both client ordered and service ordered operations. Themethod performs well in terms of response time, amount of storedstate, number of messages, and availability. It is especially wellsuited to applications in which most operations require only theclient-defined order.

Title: Typed Closure Conversion
Abstract: We study the typing properties of closure conversion for simply-typedand polymorphic -calculi. Unlike most accounts of closure conversion,which only treat the untyped -calculus, we translate well-typedsource programs to well-typed target programs. This allows latercompiler phases to take advantage of types for representationanalysis and tag-free garbage collection, and it facilitatescorrectness proofs. Our account of closure conversion for thesimply-typed language takes advantage of a simple model of objects bymapping closures to existentials. Closure conversion for thepolymorphic language requires additional type machinery, namelytranslucency in the style of Harper and Lillibridge's modulecalculus, to express the type of a closure. 1 Introduction The usualoperational models of programming languages based on the -calculuscompute by substituting terms for variables in other terms.

Title: A Semantic Model of Reference Counting and its Abstraction (Detailed Summary)
Abstract: Interpretation of Reference CountingThe semantics presented thus far is exact, and thus evaluating aparticular reference count maynot terminate, any more than a program in the standard semanticswould. For use by a compilerwe must choose a suitable abstraction (i.e., approximation) that willguarantee termination yetstill provide useful information about the true reference counts. Forus a suitable abstraction isone in which the inferred reference count is at least as great as thetrue one; i.e., we wish toerr on the side of thinking there are more pointers to an object thanthere actually are. In thissection we methodically develop such an abstraction in which: (1) thebase domains are abstractedto powersets of finite approximations, (2) the primitive functionsare abstracted similarly, (3) anabstract interpretation is thus induced on R p and R, and finally (4)a collecting interpretation ofexpressions is developed.4.1 PreliminariesTo set up things to come, we first gi...

We rely on virtual memory hardware to provide information aboutpages that have been updated or "dirtied" during a givenperiod of time. This method has been used to construct a mostlyparallel trace-and-sweep collector that exhibits very short pausetimes. Performance measurements are given. 1. Introduction Garbagecollection is an important feature of many modern computingenvironments. There are basically two styles of garbage collectionalgorithms: reference-counting collectors and tracing collectors. Inthis paper we consider only tracing collectors. A straightforwardimplementation of tracing collection prevents any client action fromoccurring while the tracing operation is performed.

One way toguarantee consistency of replicated data is to force serviceoperations to occur in the same order at all sites, but thisapproach is expensive. For some applications a weaker causaloperation order can preserve consistency whileproviding better performance. This paper describes a new way ofimplementing causal operations. Our techniquealso supports two other kinds of operations: operations that aretotally ordered with respect to one another, andoperations that are totally ordered with respect to all otheroperations. The method performs well in terms ofresponse time, operation processing capacity, amount of stored state,and number and size of messages; it doesbetter than replication methods based on reliable multicasttechniques.This research was supported in part by the National ScienceFoundation under Grant CCR-8822158 and in part bythe Advanced Research Projects ...

Title: Virtually-Synchronous Communication Based on a Weak Failure Suspector
Abstract: Thispaper shows that a FS with very weak semantics (i.e. that deliversfailure and recoveryinformation in no specific order) suffices to implementvirtually-synchronouscommunication (VSC) in an asynchronous system subject to processcrash failuresand network partitions. The VSC paradigm is particularly useful inasynchronoussystems and greatly simplifies building fault-tolerant applicationsthat mask failuresby replicating processes. We suggest a three-component architectureto implementvirtually-synchronous communication : 1) at the lowest level, the FScomponent; ontop of it, 2a) a component that defines new views, and 2b) acomponent that reliablymulticasts messages within a view.1 Introduction

We demonstrate that thesimple CERN proxy architecture outperforms all but the latest versionof Squid and continues to outperform cacheless configurations. Forthe measured load levels the Squid proxy used at least as many CPU,memory, and disk resources as CERN, in some configurationssignificantly more resources. At higher load levels the resourceutilization requirements will cross and Squid will be the one usingfewer resources.

Theobjects which mightbe referenced are left in place, and the other objects are copiedinto a more compactrepresentation.A Lisp compiler and runtime system which uses such a collector neednot havecomplete control of the processor in order to force a certaindiscipline on the stackand registers.

Title: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance
Abstract: Our growing reliance on online services accessible on the Internetdemands highly-available systemsthat provide correct service without interruptions. Byzantine faultssuch as software bugs, operatormistakes, and malicious attacks are the major cause of serviceinterruptions. This thesis describesa new replication algorithm, BFT, that can be used to buildhighly-available systems that tolerateByzantine faults. It shows, for the first time, how to buildByzantine-fault-tolerant systems that canbe used in practice to implement real services because they do notrely on unrealistic assumptionsand they perform well. BFT works in asynchronous environments likethe Internet, it incorporatesmechanisms to defend against Byzantine-faulty clients, and itrecovers replicas proactively. Therecovery mechanism allows the algorithm to tolerate any number offaults over the lifetime of thesystem provided fewer than 1=3 of the replicas become faulty within asmall window of vulnerability.The window may increase under a denial-of-service attack but thealgorithm can detect and respondto such attacks and it can also detect when the state of a replica iscorrupted by an attacker.

Thebest way to speed up a procedure call is to compile it out, butdynamic binding of object-oriented procedure calls without staticreceiver type information precludes inlining. Iterative type analysisand extended message splitting are new compilation techniques thatextract much of the necessary type information and make it possibleto hoist run-time type tests out of loops. Our system compiles codeon-the-fly that is customized to the actual data types used by arunning program. The compiler constructs a control flow graphannotated with type information by simultaneously performing typeanalysis and inlining.

Title: From Region Inference to von Neumann Machines via Region Representation Inference
Abstract: Region Inference is a technique for implementing programminglanguages that are based on typed call-by-value lambdacalculus, such as Standard ML. The mathematical runtimemodel of region inference uses a stack of regions, each ofwhich can contain an unbounded number of values. Thispaper is concerned with mapping the mathematical modelonto real machines. This is done by composing region inferencewith Region Representation Inference, which graduallyrefines region information till it is directly implementable onconventional von Neumann machines. The performance ofa new region-based ML compiler is compared to the performanceof Standard ML of New Jersey, a state-of-the-art MLcompiler.1 IntroductionIt has been suggested that programming languages whichare based on typed call-by-value lambda calculus can be implementedusing regions for memory management[17].

Results show that themodel predicts document access with a high degree of accuracy.Furthermore, the model indicates that acaching algorithm based upon the recency rates of prior documentaccess will reliably handle future documentrequests.

Title: Representing control in the presence of first-class continuations
Abstract: Languages such as Scheme and Smalltalk that provide continuations asfirst-class data objects present a challenge to efficientimplementation. Allocating activation records in a heap has provenunsatisfactory because of increased frame linkage costs, increasedgarbage collection overhead, and decreased locality of reference.However, simply allocating activation records on a stack and copyingthem when a continuation is created results in unbounded copyingoverhead. This paper describes a new approach based on stackallocation that does not require the stack to be copied when acontinuation is created and that allows us to place a small upperbound on the amount copied when a continuation is reinstated. Thisnew approach is faster than the naive stack allocation approach, andit does not suffer from the problems associated with unboundedcopying. For continuation-intensive programs, our approach is atworst a constant factor slower than the heap allocation approach, andfor typical programs, it is significantly faster. An importantadditional benefit is that recovery from stack overflow is handledgracefully and efficiently.

Title: Efficient Memory-based Learning for Robot Control
Abstract: This dissertation is about the application of machine learning torobot control. A system which has no initial model of the robot/worlddynamics should be able to construct such a model using data receivedthrough its sensors--an approach which is formalized here as the $AB(State-Action-Behaviour) control cycle. A method of learning ispresented in which all the experiences in the lifetime of the robotare explicitly remembered. The experiences are stored in a mannerwhich permits fast recall of the closest previous experience to anynew situation, thus permitting very quick predictions of the effectsof proposed actions and, given a goal behaviour, permitting fastgeneration of a candidate action. The learning can take place inhigh-dimensional non-linear control spaces with real-valued ranges ofvariables. Furthermore, the method avoids a number of shortcomings ofearlier learning methods in which the controller can become trappedin inadequate performance which does not improve. Also considered ishow the system is made resistant to noisy inputs and how it adapts toenvironmental changes. A well founded mechanism for choosing actionsis introduced which solves the experiment/perform dilemma for thisdomain with adequate computational efficiency, and with fastconvergence to the goal behaviour. The dissertation explefins indetail how the $AB control cycle can be integrated into both low andhigh complexity tasks. The methods and algorithms are evaluated withnumerous experiments using both real and simulated robot domefins.The final experiment also illustrates how a compound learning taskcan be structured into a hierarchy of simple learning tasks.

Currently,Telescript incorporates safety and security features sufficientfor deploying the first generation of mobile agentapplications, subject to certain operating restrictions. Theultimate goal is the safe hosting of arbitrary, previouslyunseen programs, or "programming the network."1.0 IntroductionTelescript is an interpreted, object-oriented language forwriting mobile agents [1, 2, 3]. In common with otherobject-oriented languages, a Telescript program is basicallya collection of hierarchically organized classes, with subclassingand multiple inheritance. However, Telescript alsoincludes built-in classes that support pre-emptively multitasked,priority scheduled process objects. A single Telescriptengine can simultaneously host processes on behalfof multipl...

Title: Dependence Based Prefetching for Linked Data Structures
Abstract: We introduce a dynamic scheme that captures the access patternsof linked data structures and can be used to predictfuture accesses with high accuracy. Our technique exploitsthe dependence relationships that exist between loads thatproduce addresses and loads that consume these addresses.By identifying producer-consumer pairs, we construct acompact internal representation for the associated structureand its traversal. To achieve a prefetching effect, a smallprefetch engine speculatively traverses this representationahead of the executing program. Dependence-basedprefetching achieves speedups of up to 25% on a suite ofpointer-intensive programs.1 IntroductionLinked data structures (LDS) such as lists and trees are used inmany important applications. The importance of LDS is growingwith the increasing popularity of C++, Java, and other systems thatuse linked object graphs and function tables. Flexible, dynamicconstruction allows linked structures to grow large and diffic...

Title: Operational Aspects of Linear Lambda Calculus
Abstract: Linear logic is a resource-aware logic that is based on an analysisof the classical proof rules of contraction (copying) and weakening(throwing away). Several previous researchers have studied functionalprogramming languages derived from linear logic according to the"formulas-as-types" correspondence. In languages withlinear logic types, one may hope that traditional implementationproblems in functional languages such as update in place could besimplified by careful use of the type system. In this paper, we provethat the standard sequent calculus proof system of linear logic isequivalent to a natural deduction style proof system. Using thenatural deduction system, we investigate the pragmatic problems oftype inference and type safety for a linear lambda calculus. Althoughterms do not have a single most-general type (for either the standardsequent presentation or our natural deduction formulation), there isa set of most-general types that may be computed usingunification....

Abstract: Oz is a higher-order concurrent constraint programming system underdevelopment at DFKI. It combines ideas from logic and concurrentprogrammingin a simple yet expressive language. From logic programmingOz inherits logic variables and logic data structures, which providefora programming style where partial information about the values ofvariablesis imposed concurrently and incrementally. A novel feature ofOz is the support of higher-order programming without sacrificingthatdenotation and equality of variables are captured by first-orderlogic.Another new feature of Oz are cells, a concurrent construct providingaminimal form of state fully compatible with logic data structures.Thesetwo features allow to express objects as procedures with state,avoidingthe problems of stream communication, the conventional communicationmechanism employed in concurrent logic programming.Based on cells and higher-order programming, Oz readily supportsconcurrent object-oriented programmin...

Title: Space-Efficient Closure Representations
Abstract: Many modern compilers implement function calls (or returns)in two steps: first, a closure environment is properlyinstalled to provide access for free variables in the targetprogram fragment; second, the control is transferred to thetarget by a "jump with arguments (or results)." Closureconversion, which decides where and how to represent closuresat runtime, is a crucial step in compilation of functionallanguages. We have a new algorithm that exploits the useof compile-time control and data flow information to optimizeclosure representations. By extensive closure sharingand allocating as many closures in registers as possible, ournew closure conversion algorithm reduces heap allocationby 36% and memory fetches for local/global variables by43%; and improves the already-efficient code generated bythe Standard ML of New Jersey compiler by about 17% on aDECstation 5000. Moreover, unlike most other approaches,our new closure allocation scheme satisfies the strong "safefor sp...

Title: Detection and Exploitation of File Working Sets
Abstract: The work habits of most individuals yield file access patterns thatare quitepronounced and can be regarded as defining working sets of files usedfor particularapplications. This paper describes a client-side cache managementtechnique fordetecting these patterns and then exploiting them to successfullyprefetch files fromservers. Trace-driven simulations show the technique substantiallyincreases the hitrate of a client file cache in an environment in which a clientworkstation is dedicatedto a single user. Successful file prefetching carries three majoradvantages: (1) applicationsrun faster, (2) there is less "burst" load placed on thenetwork, and (3)properly-loaded client caches can better survive network outages. Ourtechnique requireslittle extra code, and --- because it is simply an augmentation ofthe standardLRU client cache management algorithm --- is easily incorporated intoexistingsoftware.This work is supported by the New York State Science and TechnologyFo...

Title: Typed Memory Management in a Calculus of Capabilities
Abstract: An increasing number of systems rely on programming languagetechnology to ensure safety and security of low-levelcode. Unfortunately, these systems typically rely on a complex,trusted garbage collector. Region-based type systemsprovide an alternative to garbage collection by making memorymanagement explicit but verifiably safe. However, it hasnot been clear how to use regions in low-level, type-safe code.We present a compiler intermediate language, called theCapability Calculus, that supports region-based memorymanagement, enjoys a provably safe type system, and isstraightforward to compile to a typed assembly language.Source languages may be compiled to our language usingknown region inference algorithms. Furthermore, region lifetimesneed not be lexically scoped in our language, yet thelanguage may be checked for safety without complex analyses.Finally, our soundness proof is relatively simple, employingonly standard techniques.The central novelty is the use of static...

Title: Better Static Memory Management: Improving Region-Based Analysis of Higher-Order Languages
Abstract: Static memory management replaces runtime garbage collection withcompile-time annotations that make all memory allocationand deallocation explicit in a program. We improve upon theTofte/Talpin region-based scheme for compile-time memorymanagement [TT94]. In the Tofte/Talpin approach, all values,including closures, are stored in regions. Region lifetimes coincidewith lexical scope, thus forming a runtime stack of regions andeliminating the need for garbage collection. We relax therequirement that region lifetimes be lexical. Rather, regions areallocated late and deallocated as early as possible by explicitmemory operations. The placement of allocation and deallocationannotations is determined by solving a system of constraintsthat expresses all possible annotations. Experiments show that ourapproach reduces memory requirements significantly, in somecases asymptotically.1 IntroductionIn a recent paper, Tofte and Talpin propose a novel method for memorymanagement in type...

The first protocol (WFS)adapts based on write-write false sharing; the second(WFS+WG) based on a combination of write-writefalse sharing and write granularity. The adaptation isautomatic. No user or compiler information is needed.The choice between SW and MW is made on a perpagebasis.We measured the performance of our adaptive protocolson an 8-node SPARC cluster connected by a155 Mbps ATM network. We used eight applications,covering a broad spectrum in terms of write-writefalse sharing and write granularity. We compare ouradaptive protocols against the MW-only and the SWonlyapproach. Adaptation to write-write false sharingproves to be the critical performance factor, whileadaptation to write granularity plays only a secondaryrole in our environment and for the applications considered.Each of the tw...

Title: Hardware and Software Support for Efficient Exception Handling
Abstract: Program-synchronous exceptions, for example, breakpoints,watchpoints, illegal opcodes, and memory access violations, provideinformation about exceptional conditions, interrupting the programand vectoring to an operating system handler. Over the last decade,however, programs and run-time systems have increasingly employedthese mechanisms as a performance optimization to detect normal andexpected conditions. Unfortunately, current architecture andoperating system structures are designed for exceptional or erroneousconditions, where performance is of secondary importance, rather thannormal conditions. Consequently, this has limited the practicality ofsuch hardware-based detection mechanisms. We propose both hardwareand software structures that permit efficient handling of synchronousexceptions by user-level code. We demonstrate a softwareimplementation that reduces exceptiondelivery cost by anorder-of-magnitude on current RISC processors, and show theperformance benefits o...

Proofnets are translated into graphs of the sort used in optimal -calculus implementations; computation is performedby simple graph rewriting. This graph implementationhelps in understanding optimal reductionsin the -calculus and in the various programming languagesinspired by linear logic.1 Beyond the -calculusThe -calculus is not entirely explicit about the operationsof erasing and duplicating arguments. Theseoperations are important both in the theory of the -calculus and in its implementations, yet they are typicallytreated somewhat informally, implicitly. Theproof nets of linear logic [1] provide a refinement ofthe -calculus where these operations become explici...

Abstract: Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs) have foundwidespread use in CAD applications such as formal verification,logic synthesis, and test generation. OBDDs represent Booleanfunctions in a form that is both canonical and compact for manypractical cases. They can be generated and manipulated by efficientgraph algorithms. Researchers have found that many taskscan be expressed as series of operations on Boolean functions,making them candidates for OBDD-based methods.The success of OBDDs has inspired efforts to improve theirefficiency and to expand their range of applicability.

Title: Protection Traps and Alternatives for Memory Management of an Object-Oriented Language
Abstract: Many operating systems allow user programs to specify the protectionlevel (inaccessible, read-only, read-write) of pages in their virtualmemory address space, and to handle any protection violations thatmay occur. Such page-protection techniques have been exploited byseveral user-level algorithms for applications including generationalgarbage collection and persistent stores. Unfortunately, modernhardware has made efficient handling of page protection faults moredifficult. Moreover, page-sized granularity may not match the naturalgranularity of a given application. In light of these problems, wereevaluate the usefulness of pageprotection primitives in suchapplications, by comparing the performance of implementations thatmake use of the primitives with others that do not. Our results showthat for certain applications software solutions outperform solutionsthat rely on page-protection or other related virtual memoryprimitives. 1 Introduction Paged virtual memory mechanisms...

Title: Compiler support for garbage collection in a statically typed language
Abstract: We consider the problem of supporting compacting garbagecollection in the presence of modern compiler optimizations.Since our collector may move any heap object, it must accuratelylocate, follow, and update all pointers and valuesderived from pointers. To assist the collector, we extend thecompiler to emit tables describing live pointers, and valuesderived from pointers, at each program location where collectionmay occur. Significant results include identificationof a number of problems posed by optimizations, solutions tothose problems, a working compiler, and experimental dataconcerning table sizes, table compression, and time overheadof decoding tables during collection. While gc support canaffect the code produced, our sample programs show no significantchanges, the table sizes are a modest fraction of thesize of the optimized code, and stack tracing is a small fractionof total gc time. Since the compiler enhancements arealso modest, we conclude that the approach is...

Our measurements of these interpreters relateperformance to the complexity of the interpreter's virtual machineand demonstrate that native runtime libraries can play a key rolein providing good performance. From an architectural perspective,we show that interpreter performance is primarily a function of theinterpreter itself and is relatively independent of the applicationbeinginterpreted.

Title: The Incremental Garbage Collection of Processes
Abstract: This paper investigates some problems associated with an argumentevaluation order that we call "future' order, which is differentfrom both call-by-name and call-by-value. In call-by-future, eachformal parameter of a function is bound to a separate process (calleda "future") dedicated to the evaluation of thecorresponding argument. This mechanism allows the fully parallelevaluation of arguments to a function, and has been shown to augmentthe expressive power of a language. We discuss an approach to aproblem that arises in this context: futures which were thought to berelevant when they were created become irrelevant through beingignored in the body of the expression where they were bound. Theproblem of irrelevant processes also appears in multiprocessingproblem-solving systems which start several processors working on thesame problem but with different methods, and return with the solutionwhich finishes first. This parallel method strategy has the drawbackthat the processes which are investigating the losing methods must beidentified, stopped, and reassigned to more useful tasks. Thesolution we propose is that of garbage collection. We propose thatthe goal structure of the solution plan be explicitly represented inmemory as part of the graph memory (like Lisp's heap) so that agarbage collection algorithm can discover which processes areperforming useful work, and which can be recycled for a new task. Anincremental algorithm for the unified garbage collection of storageand processes is described.

These algorithms are based on a technique calledpartitioned garbage collection, in which a subset of the entiredatabase is collected independently of the rest. Specifically, weinvestigate the policy that is used to select what partition in thedatabase should be collected. The new partition selection policiesthat we propose and investigate are based on the intuition that thevalues of overwritten pointers provide good hints about where to findgarbage.

The new algorithm tolerates singlenode failures by maintaining a distributed log of datadependencies in the volatile memory of processes.The algorithm adds very little overhead to thememory consistency protocol: it sends no additionalmessages during failure-free periods; it adds only aminimal amount of data to one of the DSM protocolmessages; it introduces no forced rollbacks ofnon-faulty processes; and it performs nocommunication-induced accesses to stable storage.Furthermore, the algorithm logs only a very smallamount of data, because it uses the log of memoryaccesses already maintained by the memory consistencyprotocol.The algorithm was implemented in TreadMarks, astate-of-the-art DSM system. Experimental results showthat the algorithm has near zero time overhead and verylow space overhead during failure-free execution, thusrefuting the common belie...

Title: Storage Reclamation and Reorganization in Client-Server Persistent Object Stores
Abstract: In this paper we develop and evaluate a number ofstorage reclamation algorithms for client-server persistentobject stores. Experience with a detailed simulationand a prototype implementation in the Exodusstorage manager shows that one of our proposedalgorithms, the Incremental Partitioned Collector, iscomplete, maintains transaction semantics, and can berun incrementally and concurrently with client applications.Furthermore, it can significantly improve subsequentsystem performance by reclustering data, renderingit attractive even for systems that choose not tosupport automatic storage reclamation.1 IntroductionExperience with object-oriented programming languageshas demonstrated that explicit storage managementby programmers is a difficult and error pronetask --- anyone who has spent time trying to find astorage leak in a non-trivial C++ program can attestto that fact. Fortunately, in C++ programs the effectof a storage leak is limited to individual runs of progra...

Title: Memory Management with Explicit Regions
Abstract: Much research has been devoted to studies of and algorithmsfor memory management based on garbage collectionor explicit allocation and deallocation. An alternativeapproach, region-based memory management,has been known for decades, but has not been wellstudied.In a region-based system each allocation specifiesa region, and memory is reclaimed by destroyinga region, freeing all the storage allocated therein. Weshow that on a suite of allocation-intensive C programs,regions are competitive with malloc/free and sometimessubstantially faster. We also show that regions supportsafe memory management with low overhead. Experiencewith our benchmarks suggests that modifyingmany existing programs to use regions is not difficult.1 IntroductionThe two most popular memory management techniquesare explicit allocation and deallocation, asin C's malloc/free, and various forms of garbagecollection[Wil92]. Both have well-known advantagesand disadvantages, discussed further below. A t...

Title: Fixing the Java Memory Model
Abstract: The Java memory model described in Chapter 17 of theJava Language Specification gives constraints on howthreads interact through memory. The Java memorymodel is hard to interpret and poorly understood; itimposes constraints that prohibit common compiler optimizationsand are expensive to implement on existinghardware. At least one shipping optimizing Java compilerviolates the constraints of the existing Java memorymodel. These issues are particularly important forhigh-performance Java applications, since they are morelikely to use and need aggressive optimizing compilersand parallel processors.In addition, programming idioms used by some programmersand used within Sun's Java Development Kitis not guaranteed to be valid according the existing Javamemory model.This paper reviews these issues and suggests replacementmemory models for Java.1 IntroductionThe Java memory model, as described in chapter 17 ofthe Java Language Specification [GJS96], is very hardto unders...

Title: Escape analysis on lists
Abstract: Higher order functional programs constantly allocateobjects dynamically. These objects are typically conscells, closures, and records and are generally allocatedin the heap and reclaimed later by some garbage collectionprocess. This paper describes a compile timeanalysis, called escape analysis, for determining thelifetime of dynamically created objects in higher orderfunctional programs, and describes optimizationsthat can be performed, based on the analysis, to improvestorage allocation and reclamation of such objects.In particular, our analysis can be applied toprograms manipulating lists, in which case optimizationscan be performed to allow whole cons cells inspines of lists to be either reclaimed at once or reusedwithout incurring any garbage collection overhead. Ina previous paper on escape analysis [10], we had leftopen the problem of performing escape analysis onlists.Escape analysis simply determines when the argument(or some part of the argument) to a func...

Title: Stack-Based Typed Assembly Language
Abstract: In previous work, we presented Typed Assembly Language (TAL). TAL issufficiently expressive to serve as a target language for compilersof high-level languages such as ML. That work assumed such a compilerwould perform a continuation-passing style transform and eliminatethe control stack by heap-allocating activation records. However,most compilers are based on stack allocation. This paper presentsSTAL, an extension of TAL with stack constructs and stack types tosupport the stack allocation style. We show that STAL is sufficientlyexpressive to support languages such as Java, Pascal, and ML;constructs such as exceptions and displays; and optimizations such astail call elimination and callee-saves registers. This paper alsoformalizes the typing connection between CPS-based compilation andstack-based compilation and illustrates how STAL can formally modelcalling conventions by specifying them as formal translations ofsource function types to STAL types.

Title: A comparative performance evaluation of write barrier implementations
Abstract: Generational garbage collectors are able to achieve very small pausetimes by concentrating on the youngest (most recently allocated)objects when collecting, since objects have been observed to dieyoung in many systems. Generational collectors must keep track of allpointers from older to younger generations, by "monitoring"all stores into the heap. This write barrier has been implemented ina number of ways, varying essentially in the granularity of theinformation observed and stored. Here we examine a range of writebarrier implementations and evaluate their relative performancewithin a generation scavenging garbage collector for Smalltalk.

Abstract: Fault tolerance can allow processes executing in a computer system tosurvive failureswithin the system. This thesis addresses the theory and practice oftransparent faulttolerancemethods using message logging and checkpointing in distributedsystems. Ageneral model for reasoning about the behavior and correctness ofthese methods isdeveloped, and the design, implementation, and performance of two newlow-overheadmethods based on this model are presented. No specialized hardware isrequired withthese new methods.The model is independent of the protocols used in the system. Eachprocess stateis represented by a dependency vector, and each system state isrepresented by adependency matrix showing a collection of process states. The set ofsystem statesthat have occurred during any single execution of a system forms alattice, with thesets of consistent and recoverable system states as sublattices.There is thus always aunique maximum recoverable system state.The first meth...

Title: Space Efficient Conservative Garbage Collection
Abstract: We call a garbage collector conservative if it has only partialinformation about the location of pointers, and is thus forced totreat arbitrary bit patterns as though they might be pointers, in atleast some cases. We show that some very inexpensive, but previouslyunused techniques can have dramatic impact on the effectiveness ofconservative garbage collectors in reclaiming memory. Our mostsignificant observation is that static data that appears to point tothe heap should not result in misidentified references to the heap.The garbage collector has enough information to allocate around suchreferences. We also observe that programming style has a significantimpact on the amount of spuriously retained storage, typically evenif the collector is not terribly conservative. Some fairly common Cand C programming styles significantly decrease the effectiveness ofany garbage collector. These observations suffice to explain some ofthe different assessments of conservative collection that haveappeared in the literature.

Abstract: The design and development of a type secure persistent object storeis presented as part of an architecture to support experiments inconcurrency, transactions and distribution. The persistenceabstraction hides the physical properties of data from the programsthat manipulate it. Consequently, a persistent object store isrequired to be of unbounded size, infinitely fast and totallyreliable. A range of architectural mechanisms that can be used tosimulate these three features is presented. Based on a suitableselection of these mechanisms, two persistent object stores arepresented. The first store is designed for use with the programminglanguage PS-algol. Its design is evolved to yield a more flexiblelayered architecture. The layered architecture is designed to provideeach distinct architectural mechanism as a separate architecturallayer conforming to a specified interface. The motivation for thisdesign is two-fold.

Title: The Well-Founded Semantics for General Logic Programs
Abstract: A general logic program (abbreviated to "program"hereafter) is a set of rules that have both positive and negativesubgoals. It is common to view a deductive database as a generallogic program consisting of rules (IDB) sitting above elementaryrelations (EDB, facts). It is desirable to associate one Herbrandmodel with a program and think of that model as the "meaning ofthe program," or its "declarative semantics." Ideally,queries directed to the program would be answered in accordance withthis model. Recent research indicates that some programs do not havea "satisfactory" total model; for such programs, thequestion of an appropriate partial model arises. We introduceunfounded sets and well-founded partial models, and define thewell-founded semantics of a program to be its well-founded partialmodel. If the well-founded partial model is in fact a total model, wecall it the well-founded model. We show that the class of programspossessing a total well-founded model properly in...

It is based on a general treatment of syntax, rules,and proofs by means of a typed -calculus with dependent types. Syntaxis treated in a style similar to, but more general than, Martin-Lf'ssystem of arities. The treatment of rules and proofs focuses on hisnotion of a judgement. Logics are represented in LF via a newprinciple, the judgements as types principle, whereby each judgementis identified with the type of its proofs. This allows for a smoothtreatment of discharge and variable occurrence conditions and leadsto a uniform treatment of rules and proofs whereby rules are viewedas proofs of higher-order judgements and proof checking is reduced totype checking. The practical benefit of our treatment of formalsystems is that logic-indep endent tools such as proof editors andproof checkers can be constructed.

In a sense, F-logic stands in the samerelationship to the objectorientedparadigm as classical predicate calculus stands to relationalprogramming. F-logic has amodel-theoretic semantics and a sound and complete resolution-basedproof theory.

Title: Radiosity and Realistic Image Synthesis
Abstract: this paper, such as the global distribution of radiative energy inthe tree crowns, which affects the amount of light reaching theleaves and the local temperature of plant organs. The presentedframework itself is also open to further research. To begin, theprecise functional specification of the environment, implied by thedesign of the modeling framework, is suitable for a formal analysisof algorithms that capture various environmental processes. Thisanalysis may highlight tradeoffs between time, memory, andcommunication complexity, and lead to programs matching the needs ofthe model to available system resources in an optimal manner. Adeeper understanding of the spectrum of processes taking place in theenvironment may lead to the design of a mini-language for environmentspecification. Analogous to the language of L-systems for plantspecification, this mini-language would simplify the modeling ofvarious environments, relieving the modeler from the burden oflow-level programming in a general-purpose language. Fleischer andBarr's work on the specification of environments supportingcollisions and reaction-diffusion processes [20] is an inspiring stepin this direction. Complexity issues are not limited to theenvironment, but also arise in plant models. They become particularlyrelevant as the scope of modeling increases from individual plants togroups of plants and, eventually, entire plant communities. Thisraises the problem of selecting the proper level of abstraction fordesigning plant models, including careful selection of physiologicalprocesses incorporated into the model and the spatial resolution ofthe resulting structures. The complexity of the modeling task can bealso addressed at the level of system design, by assigning variouscomponents o...

Title: A Calculus for Access Control in Distributed Systems
Abstract: This paper is a study of some of the concepts, protocols, andalgorithms for security in distributed systems, with a focus onaccess control. Our treatment is fairly formal, as it is based onlogics. Our main goal is to isolate some useful and mathematicallytractable concepts. We account for how a principal may come tobelieve that another principal is making a request, either on his ownor on someone else's behalf. We also provide a logical language foraccess control lists (ACLs) and theories for deciding whetherrequests should be granted. The logic enables us to explain a varietyof protocols which can differ from one another in subtle butimportant ways. On occasion, the formal analysis has suggested ideasfor implementations, for example that some digital signatures couldbe saved. Moreover, logics make it possible to describe protocols andpolicies at a reasonable level of abstraction; we avoid the need forad hoc arguments about particular implementations. This abstractionis important in the context of heterogeneous distributedenvironments, where several implementations of a design may coexist.Our study is intended as a formal basis for parts of a securityarchitecture, and for the Digital Distributed Systems SecurityArchitecture (DSSA) in particular [11]; this architecture iscurrently under implementation. Other formal explanations of securityare conceivable. We hope that this work clarifies some of the issuesthat these alternative accounts may address. The next section is anoverview. We describe the basic logical framework in Section 3.Sections 4 and 5 extend the treatment with roles and delegation.Then, in Section 6, we consider delegation schemes and algorithms formaking access control decisions.

Its design andimplementation are tailored towards the language designer who wantsto develop new languages as well as implement existing ones in ahighly interactive manner. It emphasizes compactness of syntaxdefinitions by offering (a) a standard interface between lexical andcontext-free syntax; (b) a standard correspondence betweencontext-free and abstract syntax; (c) powerful disambiguation andlist constructs; and (d) an efficient incremental implementationwhich accepts arbitrary context-free syntax definitions.

Title: A Needed Narrowing Strategy
Abstract: The narrowing relation over terms constitutes the basis of the mostimportant operational semantics of languages that integratefunctional and logic programming paradigms. It also plays animportant role in the definition of some algorithms of unificationmodulo equational theories which are defined by confluent termrewriting systems. Due to the inefficiency of simple narrowing, manyrefined narrowing strategies have been proposed in the last decade.This paper presents a new narrowing strategy which is optimal inseveral respects. For this purpose we propose a notion of a needednarrowing step that, for inductively sequential rewrite systems,extends the Huet and Lvy notion of a needed reduction step. Wedefine a strategy, based on this notion, that computes only needednarrowing steps. Our strategy is sound and complete for a large classof rewrite systems, is optimal w.r.t. the cost measure that countsthe number of distinct steps of a derivation, computes onlyincomparable and disjoint unifiers, and is efficiently implemented byunification.

Abstract: Concurrency has been expressed variously in terms of formal languages(typically viathe shuffle operator), partial orders, and temporal logic, interalia. In this paper we extractfrom these three approaches a single hybrid approach having a richlanguage that mixesalgebra and logic and having a natural class of models of concurrentprocesses. The heartof the approach is a notion of partial string derived from the viewof a string as a linearlyordered multiset by relaxing the linearity constraint, therebypermitting partially orderedmultisets or pomsets. Just as sets of strings form languages, so dosets of pomsets formprocesses. We introduce a number of operations useful for specifyingconcurrent processesand demonstrate their utility on some basic examples. Although noneof the operationsis particularly oriented to nets it is nevertheless possible to usethem to express processesconstructed as a net of subprocesses, and more generally as a systemconsisting of components.Th...

Furthermore, noting thatrelational queries exhibit severalforms of genericity, we establish a number of collapse results of thefollowing form: The classof generic boolean queries expressible in the relational calculusaugmented with a given class ofconstraints coincides with the class of queries expressible in therelational calculus (with or withoutan order relation). We prove such results for both the natural andactive-domain semantics. Asa consequence, the relational calculus augmented with polynomialinequalities expresses the sameclasses of generic boolean queries under both the natural andactive-domain semantics.

In particular, weshow that with the most basic forms of abduction the relevantdecision problems are complete for complexity classes at the secondlevel of the polynomial hierarchy, while the use of prioritizationraises the complexity to the third level in certain cases.

We show how these rules can be incorporatedinto an anytime deduction procedure that proceeds by computingincreasingly narrow probability intervals that contain the tightestentailed probability interval. Since the procedure can be stopped atany time to yield partial information concerning the probabilityrange of any entailed sentence, one can make a tradeoff betweenprecision and computation time. The deduction method presented herecontrasts with other methods whose ability to perform logicalreasoning is either limited or requires finding all truth assignmentsconsistent ...

Title: Methods and rules
Abstract: We show how classical datalog semantics can be used directlyand very simply to provide semantics to a syntacticextension of datalog with methods, classes, inheritance,overloading and late binding. Several approaches to resolutionare considered, implemented in the model, and formallycompared. They range from resolution in Cstyle to originalkinds of resolution suggested by the declarative natureof the language. We show connections to view specificationand a further extension allowing runtime derivation of theclass hierarchy.

Title: A Schema Theorem for Context-Free Grammars
Abstract: The basic Schema Theorem for genetic algorithms is modified for agrammatically-basedlearning system. A context-free grammar is used to define a languagein which each sentenceis mapped to a fitness value. The derivation trees associated withthese sentences are used todefine the structure of schemata. The effect of crossover andmutation on schemata is described.A schema theorem is developed which describes how sentences of alanguage are propagatedduring evolution.1. IntroductionThe Schema Theorem for genetic algorithms (GA)[3] defines how useful structures in a populationof strings are propagated during the evolution of asolution. It gives a lower bound on the propagationof schemata from one generation to the next. AGA uses a fitness function to evaluate the population,and the genetic operations of crossover andmutation to search for new strings.The fixed-length nature of GA's has been extendedwith genetic programming (GP) [4], whichuses a tree-based representati...

Title: Mellin transforms and asymptotics: Harmonic sums
Abstract: . This survey presents a unified and essentially self-containedapproach to the asymptotic analysis of a large class of sums thatarise in combinatorial mathematics, discrete probabilistic models,and the average-case analysis of algorithms. It relies on the Mellintransform, a close relative of the integral transforms of Laplace andFourier. The method applies to harmonic sums that are superpositionsof rather arbitrary "harmonics" of a common base function.Its principle is a precise correspondence between individual terms inthe asymptotic expansion of an original function and singularities ofthe transformed function. The main applications are in the area ofdigital data structures, probabilistic algorithms, and communicationtheory.

Title: Parametric Shape Analysis via 3--Valued Logic
Abstract: We present a family of abstract-interpretation algorithms that arecapable of determining "shape invariants" of programs thatperform destructive updating on dynamically allocated storage. Themain idea is to represent the stores that can possibly arise duringexecution using three-valued logical structures. Questions aboutproperties of stores can be answered by evaluating predicate-logicformulae using Kleene's semantics of three-valued logic: -- If aformula evaluates to true, then the formula holds in every storerepresented by the three-valued structure. -- If a formula evaluatesto false, then the formula does not hold in any store represented bythe three-valued structure. -- If a formula evaluates to unknown,then we do not know if this formula holds in every store, in somestore, or in no store represented by the three-valued structure.Three-valued logical structures are thus a conservativerepresentation of memory stores. The approach described is aparametric framework...

Title: Process and Policy: Resource-Bounded Nondemonstrative Reasoning
Abstract: This paper investigates the appropriateness of formal dialectics as abasis for non-monotonic reasoning and defeasible reasoning that takescomputational limits seriously. Rules that can come into conflictshould be regarded as policies, which are inputs to deliberativeprocesses. Dialectical protocols are appropriate for suchdeliberations when resources are bounded and search is serial. AI, itis claimed here, is now perfectly positioned to correct manymisconceptions about reasoning that have resulted from mathematicallogic's enormous success in this century: among them, (1) that allreasons are demonstrative, (2) that rational belief is constrained,not constructed, (3) that process and disputation are not essentialto reasoning. AI mainly provides new impetus to formalize thealternative (but older) conception of reasoning, and AI providesmechanisms with which to create compelling formalism that describesthe control of processes. The technical contributions here are: thepartial justification of dialectic based on controlling search; theobservation that non-monotonic reasoning can be subsumed undercertain kinds of dialectics; the portrayal of inference in knowledgebases as policy reasoning; the review of logics of dialogue andproposed extensions; and the pre-formal and initial formal discussionof aspects and variations of dialectical systems withnon-demonstrative reasons. 1.

Title: Constructing deterministic finite-state automata in sparse recurrent neural networks
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks that are trained to behave likedeterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) can show deterioratingperformance when tested on long strings. This deterioratingperformance can be attributed to the instability of the internalrepresentation of the learned DFA states. The use of a sigmoidaldiscriminant function together with the recurrent structurecontribute to this instability. We prove that a simple algorithm canconstruct second-order recurrent neural networks with a sparseinterconnection topology and sigmoidal discriminant function suchthat the internal DFA state representations are stable, i.e. theconstructed network correctly classifies strings of arbitrary length.The algorithm is based on encoding strengths of weights directly intothe neural network. We derive a relationship between the weightstrength and the number of DFA states for robust stringclassification. For a DFA with n states and m input alphabet symbols,the constructive algorithm genera...

Title: Action logic and pure induction
Abstract: In Floyd-Hoare logic, programs are dynamic while assertions arestatic (hold at states). In actionlogic the two notions become one, with programs viewed as on-the-flyassertions whose truth is evaluatedalong intervals instead of at states. Action logic is an equationaltheory ACT conservatively extendingthe equational theory REG of regular expressions with operationspreimplication a!b (had a then b) andpostimplication b/a (b if-ever a). Unlike REG, ACT is finitely based,makes areflexive transitive closure,and has an equivalent Hilbert system. The crucial axiom is that ofpure induction, (a!a)= a!a.This work was supported by the National Science Foundation undergrant number CCR-8814921.1 IntroductionMany logics of action have been proposed, most of them in the pasttwo decades.

Title: A multiple-method knowledge-acquisition shell for the automatic generation    of knowledge-acquisition tools
Abstract: The use of predefined models of problem-solving methods is receivingconsiderable attention from researchers in thearea of knowledge acquisition. Using these models, developers ofknowledge-acquisition tools are able to prescribe theroles in which knowledge is used in completing a given task. A numberof method-oriented architectures based on asingle problem-solving method have been developed by various researchgroups. Because the methods aredomain-independent, method-oriented architectures are limited by thefact that knowledge roles that depend ondomain-specific considerations cannot be represented using the modelof problem solving. In addition, the interfacebetween the knowledge-acquisition tool and the application expertcannot adequately convey the role of eachknowledge type in the task model.

Title: Two-Dimensional Languages
Abstract: this paper, much work have been done in studying properties ofpicture languages recognizedby finite-state machines and several other models have been designed.A survey on this subject canbe found in [21]. An intersting model of two-dimensional tapeacceptor is the two-dimensional on-linetessellation automaton introduced by K. Inoue and A. Nakamura in[18]. This is defined as an infinitetwo-dimensional array of identical conventional finite-state automataand it is a special type of cellularautomaton. Despite it is not evident that it is a generalization of aone-dimensional model, it can be easily2identified to a conventional automaton when restricted to one-row (orone-column) pictures. Moreover,the family of picture languages recognized by this model of automatonsatisfy many important properties.Different systems to generate pictures using grammars have been alsoexplored (cf. [31, 32, 33, 35, 34,36, 29, 30, 39]). However, in the finite state case, this approach isshown to be less powerful than others.Another possible generalization is to describe picture languages bylogic formulas. Recently, W. Thomasgave a general formalism to describe graphs (and, in particular,pictures) as model theoretical structuresand showed as "recognizability" corresponds to the notionsof definability on existential monadic secondorder logic (cf. [38]). This is coherent with the string languagerecognizability theory where Buchi'sTheorem holds.In a recent proposal (cf. [13, 14]) a notion of recognizability of aset of pictures in terms of tilingsystems is introduced. The underlying idea is to definerecognizability by "projection of local properties".Informally, recognition in a tiling system is defined in terms of afinite set of square pictures of side twowhich c...

Title: An algorithm for approximate tandem repeats
Abstract: A perfect single tandem repeat is de#ned as a nonempty string thatcan be divided into twoidentical substrings, e.g., abcabc. An approximate single tandemrepeat is one in which thesubstrings are similar, but not identical, e.g., abcdaacd. In thispaper we consider two criterionsof similarity: the Hamming distance (k mismatches) and the editdistance (k differences). For a string S of length n and an integer k our algorithm reportsall locally optimalapproximate repeats, r uu, for which the Hamming distance of u and uis at most k, inO (nk log(n/ k)) time, or all those for which the edit distance of uand u is at most k , inO (nk log k log(n/ k)) time. This paper concentrates on a moregeneral type of repeat calledmultiple tandem repeats. A multiple tandem repeat in a sequence S isa (periodic) substringr of S of the form r uu , where u is a pre#x of r and u is a pre#x of u. An approximate multiple tandem repeat is a multiple repeat with errors; therepeated subsequencesare similar but not identical. We precisely de#ne approximatemultiple repeats, and presentan algorithm that #nds all repeats that concur with our de#nition.The time complexity ofthe algorithm, when searching for repeats with up to k errors in astring S of length n,is O (nka log(n/ k)) where a is the maximum number of periods in anyreported repeat.We present some experimental results concerning the performance andsensitivity of ouralgorithm. The problem of #nding repeats within a string is acomputational problem withimportant applications in the #eld of molecular biology. Both exactand inexact repeats occurfrequently in the genome, and certain repeats occurring in the genomeare known to berelated to diseases in the human.

The framework allows us to represent uniformlythe information sources and data structures used in recognition,including context-dependent units, pronunciation dictionaries,language models and lattices. Furthermore, general but efficientalgorithms can used for combining information sources in actualrecognizers and for optimizing their application. In particular, asingle composition algorithm is used both to combine in advanceinformation sources such as language models and dictionaries, and tocombine acoustic observations and information sources dynamicallyduring recognition. 1 Introduction Many problems in speech processingcan be usefully analyzed in terms of the "noisy channel"metaphor: given an observation sequence o, find which intendedmessage w is most likely to generate that observation sequence bymaximizing P (w; ...

We also reason about the implementation itself,say to know itis correct; this is done in a programming logic. How do all theselogics relate? Thispaper considers that question and more.We show that by taking the view that the metalogic is primary, theseother partsare related in standard ways. The metalogic should be suitably richso that the objectlogic can be presented as an abstract data type, and it must besuitably computational(or constructive) so that an instance of that type is animplementation.

Title: Continuation-Based Partial Evaluation
Abstract: Partial evaluation aims at specializing programs; it is based on callunfolding, constant propagation, and constant folding along thecontrol and data flows of a source program. A continuation representscontrol during the execution of a program. Continuation-based partialevaluation improves partial evaluation by enhancing the staticcontrol flow of the source program. An offline partial evaluator isstaged into binding-time analysis and program specialization. Thebinding-time analysis classifies source expressions to be static ordynamic. Program specialization amounts to reducing the staticexpressions and reconstructing the dynamic expressions to form theresidual program. In this context, a control-based binding-timeimprovement affects both the binding-time analysis and thecorresponding specializer. We address continuation-basedspecialization for Gomard and Jones's offline partial evaluator -Mix. We integrate a control-based binding-time improvement into-Mix's binding-time ...

Abstract: Object-oriented computing is influencing many areas of computerscience, including database systems. Despite many advances,object-oriented computing is still in its infancy and a universallyaccepted definition of an object-oriented model is virtuallynonexistent. In this thesis, the object model, meta-model, querymodel, dynamic schema evolution policies, and version control of theTIGUKAT objectbase management system are presented. An identifyingcharacteristic of this system is that all components are uniformlymodeled as objects with well-defined behavior. This is an importantachievement towards advancing database technology because it unifiesthe components of a database within a single, clean, underlyingsemantics that can be easily extended to support other databaseservices. The TIGUKAT object model is purely behavioral , supportsfull encapsulation of objects, defines a clear separation betweenprimitive components, and incorporates a uniform semantics overobjects.

Title: Probabilistic Predicate Transformers
Abstract: this paper is to link Kozen's and He's models --- we show that therelations of He provide a more general operational semanticsunderlying the predicate transformers of Kozen, leading in particularto a simple treatment of non-determinism and probability together. Inthe standard case such a link generates `healthiness'(well-formedness) conditions for predicate transformers --- theycharacterise collectively the images of relational programs in thericher predicate-transformer space: strictness, monotonicity,positive conjunctivity and continuity. In the probabilistic case, weare able to to formulate and prove probabilistic healthinessconditions that generalise the standard ones. The presentation is asfollows: in Section 6 we introduce the correspondence between He'sand Kozen's models; in Section 7 we propose probabilistic healthinessconditions; in Section 8 we show that those conditions characterise`real' programs exactly; and in Section 9 we extend Kozen's work toinclude non-determinism. Section 10 discusses probabilistictermination, and recursion. Earlier sections summarise He's andKozen's approaches, on which our work is based; and example programsare given in Sections 2, 4, 9, 10 and 11. Applications of our resultsto practical program derivation appear in [Morgan 1995].

Packardexamined the frequency of evolved CA rules as a function of Langton'sparameter [17], and interpreted the results of his experiment asgiving evidence for the following two hypotheses: (1) CA rules ableto perform complex computations are most likely to be found near"critical" values, which have been claimed to correlatewith a phase transition between ordered and chaotic behavioralregimes for CA; (2) When CA rules are evolved to perform a complexcomputation, evolution will tend to select rules with values close tothe critical values. Our experiment produced very different results,and we suggest that the interpretation of the original results is notcorrect. We also review and discuss issues related to ,dynamical-behavior classes, and computation in CA. The mainconstructive re...

We givea simpler proof of the fundamental fact that the closure of a regularlanguage under iterated splicing using a finite number of splicingrules is again regular. We then extend this result in two directions,by incorporating circular strings and by using infinite, but regular,sets of splicing rules. Section 1. Introduction In [3] and [4] TomHead introduced an operation on strings called splicing,. The basicidea is that two strings are cut at specified substrings, calledsites, and the first segment of one is reattached to the secondsegment of the other with the sites suitably modified.

To support this, we used classicallogic to represent partial specifications and to identifyinconsistenciesbetween them. We now present an adaptation of classical logic, whichwe term quasi-classical (QC) logic, that allows continued reasoningin thepresence of inconsistency. The adaptation is a weakening of classicallogicthat prohibits all trivial derivations, but still allows allresolvants ofthe assumptions to be derived. Furthermore, the connectives behave inaclassical manner. We then present a development called labelled QClogicthat records and tracks assumptions used in reasoning. Thisfacilitates alogical analysis of inconsistent information. We discuss theapplication oflabelled QC logic in the analysis of multi-perspectivespecifications. Suchspecifications are developed by multiple participants who holdoverlapping,often inconsistent, views of the systems the...

Title: A comparison of languages which operationalize and formalize KADS models of expertise
Abstract: In the field of Knowledge Engineering, dissatisfaction with therapidprototyping approach has led to a number of more principledmethodologies for the construction of knowledge based systems.Instead of immediately implementing the gathered and interpretedknowledge in a given implementation formalism according to therapidprototyping approach, many such methodologies centre around thenotion of a conceptual model: an abstract, implementation independentdescription of the relevant problem solving expertise. A conceptualmodel should describe the task which is solved by the system and theknowledge which is required by it. Although such conceptual modelshave often been formulated in an informal way, recent years have seenthe advent of formal and operational languages to describe suchconceptual models more precisely, and operationally as a means formodel evaluation. In this paper, we study a number of such formal andoperational languages for specifying conceptual models. In order toenable a meaningful comparison of such languages, we focus onlanguages which are all aimed at the same underlying conceptualmodel, namely that from the KADS method for building KBS. We describeeight formal languages for KADS models of expertise, and comparethese languages with respect to their modelling primitives, theirsemantics, their implementations and their applications. Futureresearch issues in the area of formal and operational specificationlanguages for KBS are identified as the result of studying theselanguages. The paper also contains an extensive bibliography ofresearch in this area.

We show how thedevelopment and implementation of an explicit account of a sharedunderstanding (i.e. an `ontology') in a given subject area, canimprove such communication, which in turn, can give rise to greaterreuse and sharing, inter-operability, and more reliable software.After motivating their need, we clarify just what ontologies are andwhat purposes they serve. We outline a methodology for developing andevaluating ontologies, first discussing informal techniques,concerning such issues as scoping, handling ambiguity, reachingagreement and producing definitions. We then consider the benefits ofand describe, a more formal approach. We re-visit the scoping phase,and discuss the role of formal languages and techniques in thespecification, implementation and evaluation of ontologies. Finally,we review the state of the art and practice in this emerging field,considering various case studies, software tools for ontologydevelopment, key reearch issues and future prospects.

While this was viewed as a surprise, weshow here that it is almost inevitable. In the framework ofplausibility measures, we can give a necessary condition for the KLMaxioms to be sound, and an additional condition necessary andsufficient to ensure that the KLM axioms are complete. Thisadditional condition is so weak that it is almost always met wheneverthe axioms are sound. In particular, it is easily seen to hold forall the proposals made in the literature.

Title: Polymorphism and Type Inference in Database Programming
Abstract: In order to find a static type system that adequately supportsdatabase languages, we need to express the most general type of aprogram that involves database operations. This can be achievedthrough an extension to the type system of ML that captures thepolymorphic nature of field selection, together with a technique thatgeneralizes relational operators to arbitrary data structures. Thecombination provides a statically typed language in which generalizedrelational databases may be cleanly represented as typed structures.As in ML types are inferred, which relieves the programmer of makingthe type assertions that may be required in a complex databaseenvironment. These extensions may also be used to provide staticpolymorphic typechecking in object-oriented languages and databases.A problem that arises with object-oriented databases is the apparentneed for dynamic typechecking when dealing with queries onheterogeneous collections of objects. An extension of the type systemneeded for generalized relational operations can also be used formanipulating collections of dynamically typed values in a staticallytyped language. A prototype language based on these ideas has beenimplemented. While it lacks a proper treatment of persistent data, itdemonstrates that a wide variety of database structures can becleanly represented in a polymorphic programming language.

Requirements engineering (RE) is perceived as an area of growingimportance.Due to the increasing effort spent for research in this area manycontributionsto solve different problems within RE exist. The purpose of thispaperis to identify the main goals to be reached during the requirementsengineeringprocess in order to develop a framework for RE. This frameworkconsists of thethree dimensions:. the specification dimension. the representation dimension. the agreement dimensionLooking at the RE research using this framework, the differentapproachescan be classified and therefore their interrelationships become muchclearer.Additionally the framework offers a first step towards a commonunderstandingof RE.+This work was supported by ESPRIT Basic Research Action 6353 (NATURE)which is concerned with Novel Approaches to TheoriesUnderlying Requirements Engineering and by the stateNordrhein-Westfalen, Germany.1 IntroductionThere is general agreement among softwa...

Title: Event-clock automata: a determinizable class of timed automata
Abstract: We introduce event-recording automata. An event-recording automatonis a timed automaton that contains, for every event a, a clock thatrecords the time of the last occurrence of a. The class ofevent-recording automata is, on one hand, expressive enough to model(finite) timed transition systems and, on the other hand,determinizable and closed under all boolean operations. As a result,the language inclusion problem is decidable for event-recordingautomata. We present a translation from timed transition systems toevent-recording automata, which leads to an algorithm for checking iftwo timed transition systems have the same set of timed behaviors. Wealso consider event-predicting automata, which contain clocks thatpredict the time of the next occurrence of an event. The class ofevent-clock automata, which contain both event-recording andevent-predicting clocks, is a suitable specification language forreal-time properties. We provide an algorithm for checking if a timedautoma...

Title: Asymptotic Properties of Data Compression and Suffix Trees
Abstract: Recently, Wyner and Ziv have proved that the typical length of arepeated subword found within the first n positions of a stationaryergodic sequence is (1=h) log n in probability where h is the entropyof the alphabet. This finding was used to obtain several insightsinto certain universal data compression schemes, most notably theLempel-Ziv data compression algorithm. Wyner and Ziv have alsoconjectured that their result can be extended to a stronger almostsure convergence. In this paper, we settle this conjecture in thenegative in the so called right domain asymptotic, that is, during adynamic phase of expanding the data base. We prove -- under anadditional assumption involving mixing conditions -- that the lengthof a typical repeated subword oscillates almost surely (a.s.) between(1=h 1 ) log n and (1=h 2 ) log n where 0 ! h 2 ! h h 1 ! 1. We alsoshow that the length of the nth block in the Lempel-Ziv parsingalgorithm reveals a similar behavior. We relate our findings to...

Title: A compendium of problems complete for P
Abstract: This paper serves two purposes. Firstly, it is an elementaryintroduction to thetheory of P-completeness --- the branch of complexity theory thatfocuses on identifyingthe problems in the class P that are "hardest," in thesense that they appear tolack highly parallel solutions. That is, they do not have parallelsolutions using timepolynomial in the logarithm of the problem size and a polynomialnumber of processorsunless all problem in P have such solutions, or equivalently, unlessP = NC . Secondly,this paper is a reference work of P-complete problems.

Abstract: We outline some requirements for a comprehensive methodology forbuilding ontologies, and review some important work that has beendone in the area which could contribute to this goal. We describe ourown experiences in constructing a significant ontology, emphasisingthe ontology capture phase. We first consider the very general issueof categorisation in modelling, and relate it to the process ofontology capture. We then describe the procedure that we used toidentify the terms and produce definitions. We describe a successfulway to handle ambiguous terms, which can be an enormous obstacle toreaching a shared understanding. Other important findings include: itmay not be necessary to identify competency questions before buildingthe ontology; the meta-ontology can be chosen after detailed textdefinitions are produced; defining terms which are 'cognitivelybasic' first can lead to less re-work.

Title: On the Interleaving Semantics of Transformation Units---A Step into GRACE
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to introduce the notion of a transformationunit together with its interleaving semantics and to study it as ameans of constructing large graph transformation systems from smallones in a structured and systematic way. A transformation unitcomprises a set of rules, descriptions of initial and terminalgraphs, and a control condition. Moreover, it may import othertransformation units for structuring purposes. Its semantics is abinary relation between initial and terminal graphs which is given byinterleaving sequences. As a generalization of ordinary derivations,an interleaving sequence consists of direct derivation stepsinterleaved with calls of imported transformation units. It must obeythe control condition and may be seen as a kind of structuredderivation. The introduced framework is independent of a particulargraph transformation approach and, therefore, it may enhance theusefulness of graph transformations in many contexts.

Next we conducted a usability study, in anindustrial setting, to determine whether it would be effective inpractice. The case study illustrates that technology transfer effortscan benefit from a greater focus on practitioners' needs, and thatthis focus helps identify some of the open problems that limit formalmethods technology transfer. We also found that there is often atension between the scope of the problem to be solved and thespecificity of the solution. The greater the scope of the problem,the more general the formal method solution and, thus, the morecustomization that must be done to use it in a particularenvironment.

With theemergence of languages like C and LISP, Static Analysis of programswith dynamicstorage and recursive data structures has become a field of activeresearch. Such analysisis difficult, and the Static Analysis community has recognized theneed for simplifyingassumptions and approximate solutions. However, even under the commonsimplifyingassumptions, such analyses are harder than previously recognized. TwofundamentalStatic Analysis problems are May Alias and Must Alias.

Title: An action-based framework for verifying logical and behavioural properties of concurrent systems
Abstract: A system is described which supports proving both behavioural andlogical properties of concurrent systems; these are specified bymeans of a process algebra and its associated logic. The logic is anaction based version of the branching time logic CTL, which we callACTL. It is interpreted over transition labelled structures while CTLis interpreted over state labelled ones. The core of the system aretwo existing tools, AUTO and EMC. The first builds the labelledtransition system corresponding to a term of a process algebra andpermits proof of equivalence and simplification of terms, while thesecond checks the validity of CTL logical formulae. The integrationis realized by means of two translation functions from the actionbased branching time logic ACTL to CTL and from transition-labelledto state-labelled structures. The correctness of the integration isguaranteed by the proof that the two translation functions whencoupled preserve satisfiability of logical formulae. 1. Intro...

Abstract: A domain specific language (DSL) allows one to develop software for aparticular application domain quickly and effectively, yieldingprograms that are easy to understand, reason about, and maintain. Onthe other hand, there may be a significant overhead in creating theinfrastructure needed to support a DSL. To solve this problem, amethodology is described for building domain specific embeddedlanguages (DSELs), in which a DSL is designed within an existing,higher-order and typed, programming language such as Haskell or ML.In addition, techniques are described for building modularinterpreters and tools for DSELs. The resulting methodologyfacilitates reuse of syntax, semantics, implementation code, softwaretools, as well as look-and-feel.

Title: Two Components of an Action Language
Abstract: Some of the recent work on representing action makes use ofhigh-level action languages.In this paper we show that an action language can be represented asthe sum of two distinctparts: an "action description language" and an "actionquery language." A set of propositionsin an action description language describes the effects of actions onstates. Mathematically, itdefines a transition system of the kind familiar from the theory offinite automata. An actionquery language serves for expressing properties of paths in a giventransition system. We definethe general concepts of a transition system, of an action descriptionlanguage and of an actionquery language, give a series of examples of languages of both kinds,and show how to combinea description language and a query language into one. Thisconstruction makes it possible todesign the two components of an action language independently, whichleads to the simplificationand clarification of the theory of actions.1 Introducti...

Title: Gates Accept Concurrent Behavior
Abstract: We represent concurrent processes as Boolean propositions or gates,cast in the role of acceptors of concurrent behavior. This properlyextends other mainstream representations of concurrent behavior suchas event structures, yet is defined more simply. It admits anintrinsic notion of duality that permits processes to be viewed aseither schedules or automata. Its algebraic structure is essentiallythat of linear logic, with its morphisms being consequence-preservingrenamings of propositions, and with its operations forming the coreof a natural concurrent programming language. 1 Introduction Weunderstand sequential behavior very well today, namely in terms ofacceptance of such behavior by sequential automata, e.g. a pushdownautomaton accepting an English sentence. We propose to understandconcurrent behavior via acceptance by concurrent automata of aparticularly simple kind, namely Boolean gates as devicesimplementing Boolean propositions. Since the notion of a generalBoolean...

Title: Semantic Science: machine understandable scientific theories and data
Abstract: The aim of semantic science is to have scientific data and scientific theories in machine understandable form. Scientific theories make predictions on data. In the semantic science future, whenever someone does a scientific experiment, they publish the data using a formal ontology so that there is semantic interoperability; it can be compared with other data collected by others, and used to compare theories that make prediction on this data. When someone publishes a new theory, they publish it with respect to an ontology so they can test it on all available data about which it makes predictions. We could all see which theories predict the data better. By the use of formal ontologies, we could determine which are competing theories (when they make different predictions for the same data) and which are complementary. Whenever new data is collected, we can determine which theory better predicts the data. Human-made scientific theories can be compared with machine learned theories (of course, most theories are a mix). Imagine now the best theories applied to new cases: we can use the best medical theory to predict the disease a patient has, the best geological theory to predict where landslides will occur or the best economic theory to predict the effect of a policy change.

Title: A computational approach to reflective meta-reasoning about languages with bindings
Abstract: We present a foundation for a computational meta-theory of languages with bindings implemented in a computer-aided formal reasoning environment. Our theory provides the ability to reason abstractly about operators, languages, open-ended languages, classes of languages, etc. The theory is based on the ideas of higher-order abstract syntax, with an appropriate induction principle parameterized over the language (i.e. a set of operators) being used. In our approach, both the bound and free variables are treated uniformly and this uniform treatment extends naturally to variable-length bindings. The implementation is reflective, namely there is a natural mapping between the meta-language of the theorem-prover and the object language of our theory. The object language substitution operation is mapped to the meta-language substitution and does not need to be defined recursively. Our approach does not require designing a custom type theory; in this paper we describe the implementation of this foundational theory within a general-purpose type theory. This work is fully implemented in the MetaPRL theorem prover, using the pre-existing NuPRL-like Martin-Lof-style computational type theory. Based on this implementation, we lay out an outline for a framework for programming language experimentation and exploration as well as a general reflective reasoning framework. This paper also includes a short survey of the existing approaches to syntactic reflection.

Some of it hasstructure even if the structure is often implicit, and not as rigidor regular as that found in standard database systems. Sometimes thestructure exists but has to be extracted from the data. Sometimesalso it exists but we prefer to ignore it for certain purposes suchas browsing.

Abstract: An information agent manages all or a portion of a user's informationspace. The electronic resources in this space are often distributedacross a network and can contain tremendous quantities of data.Mobile agents provide efficient access to such resources and are apowerful tool for implementing information agents. A mobile agent isan autonomous program that can migrate from machine to machine in aheterogeneous network. By migrating to the location of a resource,the agent can access the resource efficiently even if networkconditions are poor or the resource has a low-level interface.Telescript is the best-known mobile-agent system. Telescript,however, requires the programmer to learn and work with a complexobject-oriented language and a complex security model. Agent Tcl, onthe other hand, is a simple, flexible, and secure system that isbased on the Tcl scripting language and the Safe Tcl extension.

Title: Itinerant Agents for Mobile Computing
Abstract: This paper describes an abstract framework for itinerant agents thatcan be used to implement secure, remote applications in large, publicnetworks such as the Internet or the IBM Global Network. Itinerantagents are programs, dispatched from a source computer, that roamamong a set of networked servers until they accomplish their task.This is an extension to the client / server model in which the clientsends a portion of itself to the server for execution. An additionalfeature of itinerant agents is their ability to migrate from serverto server, perhaps seeking one that can help with the user's task orperhaps collecting information from all of them. A major focus of thepaper is the Agent Meeting Point, an abstraction that supports theinteraction of agents with each other and server based resources. Whyis this extended form of client-server computing desirable orvaluable? There are many detailed motivations for using itinerantagents [6]. They fall broadly into two categories: 1) support formobile computers or lightweight devices and 2) the emerging need inrapidly evolving networks for an asynchronous method of searching forinformation or transaction services. For example: 1. The reduction ofoverall communication traffic over the low-bandwidth, high-latency,high-cost access networks typically employed by mobile computers. 2.The ability of the agent to engage in high-bandwidth communication(with a server, for example) to search through large, free textdatabases. 3. The ability of lightweight mobile computers to interactwith heavyweight applications without prior, detailed knowledge ofthe remote server's capabilities. 4. The ability of the agent tointegrate knowledge from the client and server and performinferencing at the server. 5. The ability of th...

Starting froma natural similarityfunction (the so-called `max morphological distance'), we showed howto lower-bound it and how tosearch for nearest neighbors in large collections of tumor-likeshapes.Specifically, we used state-of-the-art concepts from morphology,namely the `pattern spectrum'of a shape, to map each shape to a point in n-dimensional space.Following [19, 36], we organizedthe n-d points in an R-tree. We showed that the L1 (= max) norm inthe n-d space lower-boundsthe actual distance. This guarantees no false dismissals for rangequeries. In addition, we developeda nearest-neighbor algorithm that also guarantees no falsedismissals.Finally, we implemented the method, and we tested it against atestbed of realistic tumor shapes,using an established tumor-growth model of Murray Eden[15].

Title: Harmonic broadcasting for video-on-demand service
Abstract: Until now, true video-on-demand can only be achieved usinga dedicated data flow for each service request. This bruteforceapproach is prohibitively expensive. Using multicastcan significantly reduce the system cost. This solution, however,must delay services in order to serve many requests as abatch. In this paper, we consider a third alternative calledPatching. In our technique, an existing multicast can expanddynamically to serve new clients. Allowing new clientsto join an existing multicast improves the efficiency of themulticast. Furthermore, since all requests can be served immediately,the clients experience no service delay and truevideo-on-demand can be achieved. A significant contributionof this work, is making multicast work for true videoon-demand services. In fact, we are able to eliminate theservice latency and improve the efficiency of multicast at thesame time. To assess the benefit of this scheme, we performsimulations to compare its performance with that ...

Web servers are unable to learn the true source of arequest because it is equally likelyto have originated from any member of the crowd, and evencollaborating crowd members cannotdistinguish the originator of a request from a member who is merelyforwarding the request onbehalf of another.

This model was verified by comparing its predictionswith detailed measurements of surfing patterns. The model alsoexplains the observed Zipf-like distributions in page hits observedat Web sites.

Title: Mobile agent security and Telescript
Abstract: Telescript is a software technology for building distributedapplications using the mobile agent paradigm. Telescriptmobile agents are migrating processes capable ofbeing executed on any Telescript service host. Currently,Telescript incorporates safety and security features sufficientfor deploying the first generation of mobile agentapplications, subject to certain operating restrictions. Theultimate goal is the safe hosting of arbitrary, previouslyunseen programs, or "programming the network." 1.0 IntroductionTelescript is an interpreted, object-oriented language forwriting mobile agents [1, 2, 3]. In common with otherobject-oriented languages, a Telescript program is basicallya collection of hierarchically organized classes, with subclassingand multiple inheritance. However, Telescript alsoincludes built-in classes that support pre-emptively multitasked,priority scheduled process objects. A single Telescriptengine can simultaneously host processes on behalfof multipl...

Title: Design Considerations for Supporting TCP with Per-Flow Queueing
Abstract: Recently much research attention has been focused on theuse of fair queueing schemes as a means for guaranteeingend-to-end delay bounds. Studies in this context have primarilybeen for non-feedback-controlled leaky bucket policedtraffic. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which fairqueueing (and its variants), in conjunction with appropriatelytailored buffer management schemes, can be used toachieve the following goals for TCP traffic: 1) alleviate theinherent unfairness of TCP towards connections with longround-trip times; 2) provide isolation when connections usingdifferent TCP versions share a bottleneck link; 3) provideprotection from more aggressive traffic sources, misbehavingusers or from other TCP connections in the caseof reverse path congestion; 4) alleviate the effects of ACKcompression in the presence of two-way traffic; 5) preventusers experiencing ACK loss (which causes their traffic tobe bursty) from significantly affecting other connections; 6)p...

Title: The Design and Implementation of a Secure Auction Service
Abstract: We present the design and implementation of a distributed service forperforming sealed-bid auctions. This service provides an interface bywhich clients, or "bidders", can issue secret bids to theservice for an advertised auction. Once the bidding period has ended,the auction service opens the bids, determines the winning bid, andprovides the winning bidder with a ticket for claiming the item bidupon. Using novel cryptographic techniques, the service isconstructed to provide strong protection for both the auction houseand correct bidders, despite the malicious behavior of any number ofbidders and fewer than one-third of the servers comprising theauction service. Specifically, it is guaranteed that (i) bids ofcorrect bidders are not revealed until after the bidding period hasended, (ii) the auction house collects payment for the winning bid,(iii) losing bidders forfeit no money, and (iv) only the winningbidder can collect the item bid upon. We also discuss techniques toena...

Title: The Security of Static Typing with Dynamic Linking
Abstract: Dynamic linking is a requirement for portable executable content.Executable content cannot know, ahead of time, where it is going tobe executed, nor know the proper operating system interface. Thisimposes a requirement for dynamic linking. At the same time, we wouldlike languages supporting executable content to be staticallytypable, for increased efficiency and security. Static typing anddynamic linking interact in a security-relevant way. This interactionis the subject of this paper. One solution is modeled in PVS, andformally proven to be safe.

Title: Model checking for security protocols
Abstract: As more resources are added to computer networks, and as more vendorslook to the World Wide Web asa viable marketplace, the importance of being able to restrict accessand to insure some kind of acceptablebehavior even in the presence of malicious intruders becomesparamount. People have looked to cryptographyto help solve many of these problems. However, cryptography itself isonly a tool. The security of a systemdepends not only on the cryptosystem being used, but also on how itis used. Typically, researchers haveproposed the use of security protocols to provide these securityguarantees. These protocols consist of asequence of messages, many with encrypted parts. In this paper, wedevelop a way of verifying these protocolsusing model checking. Model checking has proven to be a very usefultechnique for verifying hardware designs.By modelling circuits as finite-state machines, and examining allpossible execution traces, model checkinghas found a number of errors in real w...

Title: Edgebreaker: Connectivity Compression for Triangle Meshes
Abstract: Edgebreaker is a simple scheme for compressing the triangle/vertexincidence graphs (sometimes called connectivity or topology) ofthree-dimensional triangle meshes. Edgebreaker improves upon theworst case storage required by previously reported schemes, most ofwhich require O(nlogn) bits to store the incidence graph of a mesh ofn triangles. Edgebreaker requires only 2n bits or less for simplemeshes and can also support fully general meshes by using additionalstorage per handle and hole. Edgebreaker's compression anddecompression processes perform the same traversal of the mesh fromone triangle to an adjacent one. At each stage, compression producesan op-code describing the topological relation between the currenttriangle and the boundary of the remaining part of the mesh.Decompression uses these op-codes to reconstruct the entire incidencegraph. Because Edgebreaker's compression and decompression areindependent of the vertex locations, they may be combined with avariety o...

Title: Bidding and allocation in combinatorial auctions
Abstract: When an auction of multiple items is performed, it is often desirableto allow bids on combinations of items, as opposed to only onsingle items. Such an auction is often called "combinatorial", and theexponential number of possible combinations results in computationalintractability of many aspects regarding such an auction. This paperconsiders two of these aspects: the bidding language and theallocationalgorithm.First we consider which kinds of bids on combinations are allowedand how, i.e. in what language, they are specified. The basictradeoffis the expressibility of the language versus its simplicity. Weconsiderand formalize several bidding languages, compare their strengths, andpoint out one of them, OR-bids with phantom items, as the strongest.We then consider the problem of determining the best allocation-- a problem known to be computationally intractable. We suggest anapproach based on Linear Programming and motivate it. In particularwe obtain th...

Title: Omniware: A Universal Substrate for Web Programming
Abstract: This paper describes Omniware, a system for producing and executingmobile code. Next generationWeb applications will use mobile code to specify dynamic behavior inWeb pages, implement new Webprotocols and data formats, and dynamically distribute computationbetween servers and browsers. Likeall mobile code systems, Omniware provides portability and safety.The same compiled Omniwaremodule can be executed transparently on different machines, and amodule's access to host resourcescan be precisely controlled.In addition to portability and safety, Omniware has two uniquefeatures. First, Omniware is open.Omniware uses software fault isolation (SFI) to enforce safeexecution of standard programminglanguages, enabling Web developers to leverage the vast store ofexisting software and programmingexpertise. For example, Omniware developers can use C++ to createprograms for Web pages. Second,Omniware is fast. We evaluated Omniware under the Solaris 2.4operating system on a SPARCstation 5using eight C benchmark programs, including five programs from the CSPEC92 benchmark suite. Weevaluated the performance of Omniware in two ways. First, we showedthat Omniware modules can berepresented compactly, reducing the space consumption compared toSunPro cc shared object files by anaverage of 38%. Second, we showed that Omniware modules execute atnear native speeds. Includingthe runtime overhead necessary to ensure that Omniware modules areboth portable and safe, ourbenchmark programs ran within 6% of native performance.

Title: Digital Payment Systems with Passive Anonymity-Revoking Trustees
Abstract: . Anonymity of the participants is an important requirementfor some applications in electronic commerce, in particular forpaymentsystems. Because anonymity could be in conflict with law enforcement,for instance in cases of blackmailing or money laundering, it hasbeenproposed to design systems in which a trustee or a set of trusteescan selectivelyrevoke the anonymity of the participants involved in suspicioustransactions. From an operational point of view, it can be animportantrequirement that such trustees are neither involved in paymenttransactionsnor in the opening of an account, but only in case of a justifiedsuspicion. In this paper we propose the first efficient anonymousdigitalpayment systems satisfying this requirement. The described basicprotocolfor anonymity revocation can be used in on-line or off-line paymentsystems.Keywords: Digital payment systems, electronic money, cryptography,privacy, anonymity revocation.1 IntroductionIn most presently-used pay...

Abstract: As a confluence of data mining and WWW technologies, it is nowpossible to perform data mining on web log records collected from theInternet web page access history. The behaviour of the web pagereaders is imprinted in the web server log files. Analyzing andexploring regularities in this behaviour can improve systemperformance, enhance the quality and delivery of Internet informationservices to the end user, and identify population of potentialcustomers for electronic commerce. Thus, by observing people usingcollections of data, data mining can bring considerable contributionto digital library designers. In a joint effort between theTeleLearning-NCE project on Virtual University and NCE-IRIS projecton data mining, we have been developing the knowledge discovery tool,WebLogMiner, for mining web server log files.

Title: Compliance Checking in the PolicyMaker Trust Management System
Abstract: . Emerging electronic commerce services that use public-keycryptography on a mass-market scale require sophisticated mechanismsfor managing trust. For example, any service that receives a signedrequest for action is forced to answer the central question "Isthe key used to sign this request authorized to take thisaction?" In some services, this question reduces to "Doesthis key belong to this person?" In others, the authorizationquestion is more complicated, and resolving it requires techniquesfor formulating security policies and security credentials,determining whether particular sets of credentials satisfy therelevant policies, and deferring trust to third parties. Blaze,Feigenbaum, and Lacy [1] identified this trust management problem asa distinct and important component of network services and describeda general tool for addressing it, the PolicyMaker trust managementsystem.

Partially connected computers include mobile computers suchas laptops and personal digital assistants as well as modem-connectedhome computers, all of which are often disconnected from the network.In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of ourmobile-agent system, Agent Tcl, and the specific features thatsupport mobile computers and disconnected operation. These featuresinclude network-sensing tools and a docking system that allows anagent to transparently move between mobile computers, regardless ofwhen the computers connect to the network. 1 Introduction Mobilecomputers ha...

Title: Time Limited Blackbox Security: Protecting Mobile Agents From Malicious Hosts
Abstract: . In this paper, an approach to partially solve one of the mostdifficult aspects of security of mobile agents systems is presented,the problem of malicious hosts. This problem consists in thepossibility of attacks against a mobile agent by the party thatmaintains an agent system node, a host. The idea to solve thisproblem is to create a blackbox out of an original agent. A blackboxis an agent that performs the same work as the original agent, but isof a different structure. This difference allows to assume a certainagent protection time interval, during which it is impossible for anattacker to discover relevant data or to manipulate the execution ofthe agent. After that time interval the agent and some associateddata get invalid and the agent cannot migrate or interact anymore,which prevents the exploitation of attacks after the protectioninterval.

Abstract: Patching has been shown to be cost efficient for video-on-demandsystems. Unlike conventional multicast, patching is a dynamicmulticast scheme which enables a new request to join an ongoingmulticast. Since a multicast can now grow dynamically to serve newusers, this approach is more efficient than traditional multicast. Inaddition, since a new request can be serviced immediately withouthaving to wait for the next multicast, true video-on-demand can beachieved. In this paper, we introduce the notion of patching window,and present a generalized patching method. We show that existingschemes are special cases with a specific patching window size. Wederive a mathematical formula to help determine the optimal size forthe patching window. This formula allows us to design the bestpatching scheme given a workload. The proposed technique is validatedusing simulations. They show that the analytical results are veryaccurate. We also provide performance results to demonstrate that theoptimal...

Abstract: Software agents help automate a variety of tasksincluding those involved in buying and selling productsover the Internet. Although shopping agents provideconvenience for consumers and yield more efficientmarkets, today's first-generation shopping agents arelimited to comparing merchant offerings only on priceinstead of their full range of value. As such, they do adisservice to both consumers and retailers by hidingimportant merchant value-added services fromconsumer consideration. Likewise, the increasinglypopular online auctions pit sellers against buyers indistributive negotiation tug-of-wars over price. Thispaper analyzes these approaches from economic,behavioral, and software agent perspectives thenproposes integrative negotiation as a more suitableapproach to retail electronic commerce. Finally, weidentify promising techniques (e.g., multi-attributeutility theory, distributed constraint satisfaction, andconjoint analysis) for implementing agent-mediatedintegrative negotiation.1.

Abstract: The original Web did not support multiuser, interactive applications.This shortcoming is being studied, and severalapproaches have been proposed to use the Web as a platform forprogramming Internet applications. However, most existingapproaches are oriented to centralized applications at servers, orlocal programs within clients. To overcome this deficit, weintroduce PageSpace, that is a reference architecture for designinginteractive multiagent applications. In this paper we describe howwe control agents in PageSpace, using variants of the coordinationlanguage Linda to guide their interactions. Coordinationtechnology is integrated with the standard Web technology and theprogramming language Java. Several kinds of agents live in thePageSpace: user interface agents, personal homeagents, agents thatimplement applications, and agents which interoperate withlegacy systems. Within our architecture, it is possible to supportfault-tolerance and mobile agents as well.Index Terms...

Title: Cluster reserves: a mechanism for resource management in cluster-based network servers
Abstract: In network (e.g., Web) servers, it is often desirable to isolate theperformance of different classes of requests from each other. Thatis, one seeks to achieve that a certain minimal proportion of serverresources are available for a class of requests, independent of theload imposed by other requests. Recent work demonstrates how toachieve this performance isolation in servers consisting of a single,centralized node; however, achieving performance isolation in adistributed, cluster based server remains a problem. This paperintroduces a new abstraction, the cluster reserve, which represents aresource principal in a cluster based network server. We present adesign and evaluate a prototype implementation that extends existingtechniques for performance isolation on a single node server tocluster based servers. In our design, the dynamic cluster-wideresource management problem is formulated as a constrainedoptimization problem, with the resource allocations on individualmachin...

Title: Operating system support for busy internet servers
Abstract: The Internet has experienced exponential growth in the use of theWorld-WideWeb, and rapid growth in the use of other Internet services such asUSENETnews and electronic mail. These applications qualitatively differfrom other networkapplications in the stresses they impose on busy server systems.Unliketraditional distributed systems, Internet servers must cope with hugeuser communities,short interactions, and long network latencies.

Title: Exploiting an Event-Based Infrastructure to Develop Complex Distributed Systems
Abstract: The development of complex distributed systems demandsfor the creation of suitable architectural styles (or paradigms)and related run-time infrastructures. An emerging style thatis receiving increasing attention is based on the notion ofevent. In an event-based architecture, distributed softwarecomponents interact by generating and consuming events.The occurrence of an event in a component (called source) isasynchronously notified to any other component (called recipient)that has declared some interest in it. This paradigmholds the promise of supporting a flexible and effective interactionamong highly reconfigurable distributed softwarecomponents.We have developed an object-oriented infrastructure, calledJEDI (Java Event-based Distributed Infrastructure), to supportthe development and operation of event-based systems.During the past year, JEDI has been used to implement asignificant example of distributed system, namely, the OPSSworkflow management system.The paper ...

Here we show that for a wide rangeof practical situationsand properties it is possible to perform the verification on a finiteand safe abstract model.1 IntroductionFormal verification of cryptographic protocols has recently receivedincreased consideration dueto the importance of cryptographic protocols in the design of newsecurity or electronic commercearchitectures. Many proof-based verification techniques have beenproposed (see [2] fora discussion of this issue) to perform systematic analysis of largeprotocols. Although these approacheshave been quite successful in identifying flaws or as a support forthe design of newelectronic commerce protocols, they require significant resourcesduring the verification process.Model-checking based techniques ...

Abstract: We address why, and especially how, to representbusiness rules in e-commerce contracts. By contracts,we mean descriptions of goods and servicesoffered or sought, including ancillary agreementsdetailing terms of a deal. We observe that rulesare useful in contracts to represent conditional relationships,e.g., in terms & conditions, service provisions,and surrounding business processes, and weillustrate this point with several examples.We analyze requirements (desiderata) for representingsuch rules in contracts. The requirementsinclude: declarative semantics so as to enableshared understanding and interoperability; prioritizedconflict handling so as to enable modularupdating/revision; ease of parsing; integrationinto WWW-world software engineering; direct executability;and computational tractability.We give a representational approach that consistsof two novel aspects.

Title: Towards the Formal Verification of Electronic Commerce Protocols
Abstract: We generalize the approach defined in [4] so as to be able toformally verify electronic payment protocols. The original approachis based on the use of general purpose formal methods. It iscomplementary with modal logic based-approaches as it allows for adescription of protocols, hypotheses and authentication properties ata finer level of precision and with more freedom. The proposedgeneralization mainly requires being able to express and verifypayment properties. Such properties are indeed much more elaboratethan authentication ones, and require a significant generalization inthe way properties are expressed. The modelling of the protocol andof the potential knowledge hold by intruders is on the other handleft unchanged. The approach is currently being applied to the C-SETand SET protocols, and has already lead to significant results. 1Introduction Consumer demand for secure access to electronic shoppingand other services is becoming very high.

Title: Cryptographic Traces for Mobile Agents
Abstract: . Mobile code systems are technologies that allow applicationsto move their code, and possibly the corresponding state, among thenodes of a wide-area network. Code mobility is a flexible andpowerfulmechanism that can be exploited to build distributed applicationsin an Internet scale. At the same time, the ability to move code toandfrom remote hosts introduces serious security issues. These issuesincludeauthentication of the parties involved and protection of the hostsfrommalicious code. However, the most difficult task is to protect mobilecode against attacks coming from hosts. This paper presents amechanismbased on execution tracing and cryptography that allows one todetect attacks against code, state, and execution flow of mobilesoftwarecomponents.1 IntroductionMobile code technologies are languages and systems that exploit someformof code mobility in an Internet-scale setting.

Title: Anonymous atomic transactions
Abstract: We show here an example of a protocol that satisfies anonymityproperties while providing strong ACID (atomic, consistent, isolated,durable) transactional properties, resolving an open question. Thisallows us to provide electronic commerce protocols that are robusteven in the event of message loss and communication failures. We useblind signature tokens to control values. We use a separatetransaction log to reduce trust assumptions between the merchant,theconsumer, and the bank. 1 Introduction Consumer privacy is animportant goal of electronic payment systems. Some researchers haveapproached this question by adopting a token-based model. Thesetokens are meant to act as a type of currency: they can be used topurchase a good, but like coins, they do not reveal the identity ofthe holder. These systems offer privacy in making a purchase. Sometypical examples of tokenbased electronic payment protocols("digital cash" protocols) are [2, 3, 7, 5, 15]. Theseprotocols provide cons...

Title: Proactive Public Key and Signature Systems
Abstract: Emerging applications like electronic commerce and securecommunications over open networks have madeclear the fundamental role of public key cryptographyas a unique enabler for world-wide scale security solutions.On the other hand, these solutions clearly exposethe fact that the protection of private keys is a securitybottleneck in these sensitive applications. This problemis further worsened in the cases where a single and unchangedprivate key must be kept secret for very longtime (such is the case of certification authority keys,bank and e-cash keys, etc.).One crucial defense against exposure of private keysis offered by threshold cryptography where the privatekey functions (like signatures or decryption) are distributedamong several parties such that a predeterminednumber of parties must cooperate in order tocorrectly perform these operations. This protects keysfrom any single point of failure. An attacker needs tobreak into a multiplicity of locations before it ca...

Title: Modelling a Public-Key Infrastructure
Abstract: . A global public-key infrastructure (PKI), components of which areemerging in the near future, is a prerequisite for security indistributed systems and for electronic commerce. The purpose of thispaper is to propose an approach to modelling and reasoning about aPKI from a user Alice's point of view. Her view, from which she drawsconclusions about the authenticity of other entities' public keys andpossibly about the trustworthiness of other entities, consists ofstatements about which public keys she believes to be authentic andwhich entities she believes to be trustworthy, as well as acollection of certificates and recommendations obtained or retrievedfrom the PKI. The model takes into account recommendations for thetrustworthiness of entities. Furthermore, it includes confidencevalues for statements and can exploit arbitrary certificationstructures containing multiple intersecting certification paths toachieve a higher confidence value than for any single certificationp...

Title: Making Trust Explicit in Distributed Commerce Transactions
Abstract: In a distributed environment where nodes are independentlymotivated, many transactions or commercial exchangesmay be stymied due to a lack of trust between theparticipants. The addition of trusted intermediaries mayfacilitate some exchanges, but others are still problematic.We introduce a language for specifying these commercialexchange problems, and sequencing graphs, a formalismfor determining whether a given exchange may occur. Wealso present an algorithm for generating a feasible executionsequence of pairwise exchanges between parties (whenit exists). Indemnities may be offered to facilitate previouslyinfeasible transactions. We show when and how they enablecommercial transactions.1 IntroductionElectronic commerce is a rapidly expanding field, withvast computer networks bringing together many potentialcustomers and producers, increasing the number and rangeof contacts, and increasing the likelihood of matching producersand consumers.

Title: Faster IP Lookups Using Controlled Prefix Expansion
Abstract: Internet (IP) address lookup is a major bottleneck in highperformance routers. IP address lookup is challenging because itrequires a longest matching prefix lookup. It is compounded byincreasing routing table sizes, increased traffic, higher speedlinks, and the migration to 128 bit IPv6 addresses. We describe howIP lookups can be made faster using a new technique called controlledprefix expansion. Controlled prefix expansion, together withoptimization techniques based on dynamic programming, can be used toimprove the speed of the best known IP lookup algorithms by at leasta factor of two. When applied to trie search, our techniques providea range of algorithms whose performance can be tuned. For example,with 1 MB of L2 cache, trie search of the MaeEast database with38,000 prefixes can be done in a worst case search time of 181 nsec,a worst case insert/delete time of 2.5 msec, and an averageinsert/delete time of 4 usec.

Abstract: Commerce over open networks like the Internet, sometimes referred toas electronic commerce, isbecoming more widespread. This makes it important to study, and solvethe security problemsassociated with electronic commerce. There are three prominentcharacteristics of commerce whichare relevant in this respect. First, the crux of a commercialtransaction is usually one or moreexchanges of items of value. Second, players in a commercialtransaction do not necessarily trusteach other fully. Thus, protecting players from each other is asimportant as protecting them fromoutside attackers. Third, commercial transactions have legalsignificance. Therefore, it must bepossible to gather sufficient evidence during the transaction toenable correctly behaving playersto win any subsequent disputes.This dissertation addresses the problem of fairness in electroniccommerce.

Abstract: In addressing the growing problem of junk E-mail onthe Internet, we examine methods for the automatedconstruction of filters to eliminate such unwanted messagesfrom a user's mail stream. By casting this problemin a decision theoretic framework, we are able tomake use of probabilistic learning methods in conjunctionwith a notion of differential misclassification costto produce filters which are especially appropriate forthe nuances of this task. While this may appear, atfirst, to be a straight-forward text classification problem,we show that by considering domain-specific featuresof this problem in addition to the raw text ofE-mail messages, we can produce much more accuratefilters. Finally, we show the efficacy of such filters in areal world usage scenario, arguing that this technologyis mature enough for deployment.IntroductionAs the number of users connected to the Internet continuesto skyrocket, electronic mail (E-mail) is quicklybecoming one of the fastest and m...

Title: Paris metro pricing for the internet
Abstract: : A simple approach, called PMP (Paris Metro Pricing), is suggestedfor providing differentiatedservices in packet networks such as the Internet. It is to partitiona network into severallogically separate channels, each of which would treat all packetsequally on a best effort basis. Therewould be no formal guarantees of quality of service. These channelswould differ only in the pricespaid for using them. Channels with higher prices would attract lesstraffic, and thereby providebetter service. Price would be the primary tool of trafficmanagement.PMP is the simplest differentiated services solution. It is designedto accomodate user preferencesat the cost of sacrificing some of the utilization efficiency of thenetwork.1.

Abstract: XML is rapidly emerging as the new standard for data representationand exchange on the Web.

DTDs contain valuableinformation on the structure of documents and thus have a crucialrole in the efficient storage of XML data, as well as the effectiveformulation and optimization of XML queries. In this paper, wepropose XTRACT, a novel system for inferring a DTD schema fora database of XML documents. Since the DTD syntax incorporatesthe full expressive power of regular expressions, naive approachestypically fail to produce concise and intuitive DTDs. Instead, theXTRACT inference algorithms employ a sequence of sophisticatedsteps that involve: (1) finding patterns in the input sequences andreplacing them with regular expressions to generate"general" candidateDTDs, (2) factoring candidate DTDs using adaptations ofalgorithms from the logic optimization...

Title: An Efficient Fair Payment System
Abstract: Many proposed payment systems allow the payer to remainanonymous during a transaction. However, this unconditionalprivacy protection could be misused by criminals, e.g.for blackmailing or money laundering. With a fair paymentsystem, anonymous payments are still possible, but the anonymitycan be removed with the help of a trusted partywhich need not be involved in the transaction itself. In thispaper, we present an efficient fair payment system and wediscuss its security.1 IntroductionEfficient electronic payment systems are an important prerequisitefor electronic commerce. The design of such paymentsystems poses many security-related problems. Apartfrom the common security requirements such as the preventionof frauds, the protection of the participants' privacy isan important issue.In many systems the protection of the user's privacy reliesexclusively on administrative and legal measures.

Previous work that has pointed this interesting problemout contained only partial treatment. In this work we present thefirst general treatment of the coercion problem in securecomputation. First we present a general definition of protocols thatprovide resilience to coercion. Our definition constitutes a naturalextension of the general paradigm used for defining secure multipartyprotocols. Next we show that if trapdoor permutations exist then anyfunction can be incoercibly computed (i.e., computed by a protocolthat provides resilience to coercion) in the presence ofcomputationally bounded adversaries and only public communicationchannels.

Title: Competitive auctions and digital goods
Abstract: We study a class of single round, sealed bid auctions for items inunlimited supply such as digital goods. We focus on auctions that aretruthful and competitive. Truthful auctions encourage bidders to bidtheir utility; competitive auctions yield revenue within a constantfactor of the revenue for optimal fixed pricing. We show that for anytruthful auction, even a multi-price auction, the expected revenuedoes not exceed that for optimal fixed pricing. We also give a boundon how far the revenue for optimal fixed pricing can be from thetotal market utility. We show that several randomized auctions aretruthful and competitive under certain assumptions, and that notruthful deterministic auction is competitive. We present simulationresults which con rm that our auctions compare favorably to fixedpricing. Some of our results extend to bounded supply markets, forwhich we also get truthful and competitive auctions.

Abstract: One of the major achievements of mechanism design theory is thefamily of truthful (incentive compatible) mechanisms often called VCG(named after Vickrey, Clarke and Groves). When applying VCGmechanismsto complex mechanism design problems such as combinatorialauctions a problem emerges: even finding optimal outcomes iscomputationallyintractable. A striking observation is that if the optimaloutcome is replaced by the results of computationally tractableapproximationalgorithms or heuristics then the resulting mechanism (termedVCG-based) is no longer necessarily truthful!The first part of this paper considers this problem in depth andshows that it is almost universal. Specifically, we prove thatessentiallyall reasonable approximations or heuristics for combinatorialauctionsas well as a wide class of cost minimization problems yieldnon-truthfulVCG-based mechanisms.

Abstract: this paper we describe an approach to usage-based Web personalizationtaking into account the fullspectrum of Web mining techniques and activities. Our approach isdescribed by the architecture shownin Figure 1, which heavily uses data mining techniques, thus makingthe personalization process bothautomatic and dynamic, and hence up-to-date. Specifically, we havedeveloped techniques forpreprocessing of Web usage logs and grouping URL references into setscalled user transactions[CMS99]. A user transaction is a unit of semantic activity, andperforming data mining on them is moremeaningful. We describe and compare three different Web usage miningtechniques, based on transactionclustering, usage clustering, and association rule discovery, toextract usage knowledge for the purposeof Web personalization. We also propose techniques for combining thisknowledge with the current statusof an ongoing Web activity to perform real-time personalization.Finally, we provide an experimentalevaluation of the proposed techniques using real Web usage data.

Title: Efficient concurrency control for broadcast environments
Abstract: A crucial consideration in environments where data is broadcastto clients is the low bandwidth available for clients tocommunicate with servers. Advanced applications in suchenvironments do need to read data that is mutually consistentas well as current. However, given the asymmetric communicationcapabilities and the needs of clients in mobile environments,traditional serializability-based approaches aretoo restrictive, unnecessary, and impractical. We thus proposethe use of a weaker correctness criterion called updateconsistency and outline mechanisms based on this criterionthat ensure (1) the mutual consistency of data maintainedby the server and read by clients, and (2) the currency ofdata read by clients. Using these mechanisms, clients canobtain data that is current and mutually consistent "off theair", i.e., without contacting the server to, say, obtain locks.Experimental results show a substantial reduction in responsetimes as compared to existing (serializabilit...

Title: Analyzing consumer-product graphs: Empirical findings and applications in recommender systems. Management Science, under review
Abstract: We apply random graph modeling methodology to analyze bipartite consumer-product graphs that represent sales transactions to better understand consumer purchase behavior in e-commerce settings. Based on two real-world e-commerce data sets, we found that such graphs demonstrate topological features that deviate significantly from theoretical predictions based on standard random graph models. In particular, we observed consistently larger-than-expected average path lengths and a greater-than-expected tendency to cluster. Such deviations suggest that the consumers  product choices are not random even with the consumer and product attributes hidden. Our findings provide justification for a large family of collaborative filtering-based recommendation algorithms that make product recommendations based only on previous sales transactions. By analyzing the simulated consumer-product graphs generated by models that embed two representative recommendation algorithms, we found that these recommendation algorithm-induced graphs generally provided a better match with the real-world consumer-product graphs than purely random graphs. However, consistent deviations in topological features remained. These findings motivated the development of a new recommendation algorithm based on graph partitioning, which aims to achieve high clustering coefficients similar to those observed in the real-world e-commerce data sets. We show empirically that this algorithm significantly outperforms representative collaborative filtering algorithms in situations where the observed clustering coefficients

Title: Choice of Transaction Channels: The Effects of Product Characteristics on Market Evolution
Abstract: The capabilities of network technologies have facilitated the growth of electronic commerce. Major issues, notably security and product quality uncertainty, still pose serious challenges to the further adoption of electronic commerce. Traditional market transactions have a long history and well-understood protections for buyers and sellers. In the electronic markets, formal and informal mechanisms such as trusted third parties (TTP) have emerged trying to ensure safe transactions. In this paper we investigate under what conditions people will stick to the traditional market and face-to-face transactions, and under what conditions electronic transactions will be the convention of the future. Of particular interest is the role of trusted third parties in facilitating online transactions. Using evolutionary game theory, we present an analytical model of buyer and seller choices and examine which patterns of transactions can be sustained. We further study how the traders  adaptive behavior may influence the outcome of the market evolution. Through this analysis, we demonstrate that the market will show divergence: for commodity products, electronic transactions through TTPs will get established as the convention for market transactions when traders use historical information about other traders  past strategies. For look and feel  products, the market evolution depends on the initial distribution of the transaction strategies in the population.

Title: The semantic desktop - a basis for personal knowledge management
Abstract: : Knowledge Management software is software that integrates. Existing Data sources, process flows, application features from office appliances have to be brought together. There are different standards, consisting of data formats and communication protocols, that address this issue. The WWW and Semantic Web are designed to work on a worldwide scale and define those standards. We transfer the web standards to the desktop szenario, a vision we call Semantic Desktop  a Semantic Web enhanced desktop environment. Central is the idea of taking know-how from the Semantic Web to tackle personal information management. Existing desktop applications (email client, browser, office applications) are integrated, the semantic glue between them expressed using ontologies. We also present the www.gnowsis.org open source project by the DFKI that realizes parts of this vision. It is based on a Semantic Web Server running as desktop service. It was used in experiments and research projects and allows others to experiment. Knowledge management applications can be built on top of it, reducing the implementation cost. 1

Title: Abstract Secure E-Commerce Transactions for Multicast Services
Abstract: With the advent of an increasing number of multicast services such as audio/video streaming, news broadcast and software distribution, accounting for the resources consumed by subscribers becomes essential. However, multicast environments are inherently more susceptible to attacks because there is as yet no proper foundation for securing multicast networks. However, any e-commerce operational environment requires support for the security properties such as authentication, authorization, data confidentiality, and non-repudiation. As secured multicast services gain popularity in the Internet, at one point there would be a significant response from the service providers to support e-commerce through multicast networks. In this thesis, a Multicast Security Protection Profile (MSPP) has been presented to identify and secure the operating environment of multicast sessions. Although e-commerce protocols such as SSL, TLS, and SET protocols offer some forms of security in e-transactions, they cannot be directly extended to provide security for e-commerce sessions in the multicast (point-to-multipoint) environment. Therefore, we have designed an architectural framework, called the Secure E-Commerce Transactions for Multicast Services (SETMS), to secure e-commerce sessions for multicast environments. The SETMS framework provides authentication of host through HIP

Title: H.: Towards Ubiquitous Tourist Service Coordination and Integration: A Multi-Agent and Semantic Web Approach
Abstract: With the recent advances in mobile technologies and infrastructures, there are increasing demands for ubiquitous access to tourist information systems for service coordination and integration. However, disparate tourist information and service resources make it particularly difficult for mobile tourists to use them effectively during their trips. Neither can current tourist portals assist tourists proactively or adequately to overcome this problem. Motivated by the emerging technologies of multi-agent information systems (MAIS) that can effectively assist mobile users together with Semantic Web that can effectively organize information and service resources, we propose a ubiquitous tourist assistance system (UTAS) be built upon these technologies. In this paper, we formulate a scalable, flexible, and intelligent MAIS infrastructure for a proactive UTAS with agent clusters based on a case study of a large service-oriented travel agency. Each agent cluster comprises several types of agents to achieve the goals of the major processes of a tourists trip. We show how agents can make use of ontology from the Semantic Web to plan better as well as help tourists better understand and specify their requirements and preferences. We discuss and evaluate our approach from different stakeholders  perspective.

Abstract: 10 Economic theory provides a unique vantage point from which to examine issues with respect to emerging technologies, where stan-11 dards and adoption, business process changes and implementation outcomes, information security, investments and business value, and 12 industry impact require care and consideration on the part of senior management strategists and financial services leaders. In this article, 13 we examine a new technology application which is coming into its own around the world, in association with the revolution in wireless 14 connectivity: mobile payments. Although there are likely to be nuances and surprises with this technology application, we caution the 15 reader to recognize that many of the same economic forces will be at work as were with other financial services and related technology 16 applications in the past. We apply a robust evaluative framework that permits identification of the relevant stakeholders and applicable 17 theory in the analysis of consumer, firm, business process, market, industrial and social issues. Our findings are intended to guide senior 18 managers in dealing with the economic aspects of mobile payments, and to help identify some important directions for the research.

Title: The Paradigm of E-Commerce in E-Government and E-Democracy
Abstract: During its relatively short history e-commerce, the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in business has been more successful and glamorous than e-government or e-democracy, the comparable use of ICT in governments and administration. This may be the reason why many government initiatives try to emulate the success of e-commerce by using concepts, processes, technologies, and approaches pioneered by businesses. This paper analyses the relevance and limits of this use of e-commerce as a paradigm in government. For this purpose it starts out by distinguishing between e-government and e-democracy. In the following step the paper discusses which factors have led to the success of ecommerce and might therefore be applicable as parts of the paradigm. It then discusses the strengths and the weaknesses of e-commerce as applied to government. The conclusion will be that there are good reasons to use the commercial paradigm in e-government and e-democracy. However, this may lead to an unintended shift towards e-government. E-democracy may even be weakened by the paradigm which might turn out to be detrimental to the democratic legitimacy of e-government and e-democracy.

Title: Cashing up with Mobile Money  the fairCASH Way", Euro mGov 2005
Abstract: Today we still do not have a widely available digital cash system for the masses. This is not because there are no inventions in this area or the money community is out of ideas on how to construct such a system. It is mainly because there are conflicts of interests between banks, government and community. In this paper we first present a short history of money and look at these conflicts. Then we focus on the so-called success-factors, which are essential for a highly accepted e-Payment system. Based on these success-factors, we will present a new system called fairCASH. By adopting our fairCASH system, users will be able to make payments of any value, including micro payments. fairCASH is a multipurpose, multi-currency, pre-paid inter-operable scheme for domestic usage and cross border payments. It features non-account-related completely anonymous payment transactions by encrypting the transferred e-Tokens. There is no need of registration for users of the fairCASH e-Money system. It is suitable for person-to-person, chip-to-chip or P2P money transfers. It is independent of the communication platform or the digital transmission standard. Highlights are the inherent zero transaction costs for B2C, B2B and C2C operations. Last but not least, we would like to point out that the system posses the multi-hopping capability allowing e-Token circulation that is very advantages for users of such system.

Title: A Simple Secure M-Commerce Protocol SSMCP* Summary
Abstract: The trend in technology is such that small lightweight lowcomplexity devices, like PDAs, cell-phones,...,will become one of the more predominant computing platforms. Consequently, these devices will play an increasing role in e-commerce and mcommerce transactions. In the past, the role of the merchant has been played by workstations/servers, but due to advancements in wireless communications, like Bluetooth, we should expect more peer-to-peer e-commerce/m-commerce transactions and hence we should expect more lightweight devices playing the role of merchants. Here we develop secure efficient m-commerce protocol SSMCP*. This is a low-complexity protocol that is both efficient for mobile lightweight customers as well as mobile lightweight merchants. SSMCP * is both efficient in terms of bandwidth, eliminating any redundant information, as well as efficient in terms of rounds of communication. Further, SSMCP* addresses the important issue of a fair commitment to the transaction between the merchant and the customer. Key words: m-commerce, e-commerce, security for mobile devices

Title: A design process for adaptive behavior of situated agents
Abstract: . Engineering non-trivial open multi-agent systems is a challenging task. Our research focusses on situated multi-agent systems, i.e. systems in which agents are explicitly placed in an environment which agents can perceive and in which they can act. Situated agents do not use long-term planning to decide what action sequence should be executed, but select actions based on the locally perceived state of the world and limited internal state. To cope with change and dynamism of the system, situated agents must be able to adapt their behavior. A well-known family of agent architectures for adaptive behavior are free-flow architectures. However, building a free-flow architecture based on an analysis of the problem domain is a quasi-impossible job for non-trivial agents. To tackle the complexity of designing adaptive agent behavior based on a free-flow architecture, suitable abstractions are needed to describe and structure the agent behavior. The abstraction of a role is obviously essential in this respect. A modeling language is needed as well to model the behavior of the agents. We propose a statechart modeling language to support the design of roles for situated agents. In this paper we describe a design process for adaptive behavior of situated agents as part of a multi-agent oriented methodology. The design process integrates the abstraction of a role with a free-flow architecture. Starting from the results of analysis of the problem domain, the designer incrementally refines the model of the agent behavior. The resulting class diagram serves as a basis for implementation. We illustrate the subsequent design steps with a case study on controlling a collection of automated guided vehicles. 1

Title: Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning: The State of the Art
Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent systems are ones in which several agents attempt, through their interaction, to jointly solve tasks or to maximize utility. Due to the interactions among the agents, multi-agent problem complexity can rise rapidly with the number of agents or their behavioral sophistication. The challenge this presents to the task of programming solutions to multi-agent systems problems has spawned increasing interest in machine learning techniques to automate the search and optimization process. We provide a broad survey of the cooperative multi-agent learning literature. Previous surveys of this area have largely focused on issues common to specific subareas (for example, reinforcement learning or robotics). In this survey we attempt to draw from multi-agent learning work in a spectrum of areas, including reinforcement learning, evolutionary computation, game theory, complex systems, agent modeling, and robotics. We find that this broad view leads to a division of the work into two categories, each with its own special issues: applying a single learner to discover joint solutions to multi-agent problems (team learning), or using multiple simultaneous learners, often one per agent (concurrent learning). Additionally, we discuss direct and indirect communication in connection with learning, plus open issues in task decomposition, scalability, and adaptive dynamics. We conclude with a presentation of multi-agent learning problem domains, and a list of multi-agent learning resources. 1

Title: Efficient credit assignment through evaluation function decomposition
Abstract: Evolutionary methods are powerful tools in discovering solutions for difficult continuous tasks. When such a solution is encoded over multiple genes, a genetic algorithm faces the difficult credit assignment problem of evaluating how a single gene in a chromosome contributes to the full solution. Typically a single evaluation function is used for the entire chromosome, implicitly giving each gene in the chromosome the same evaluation. This method is inefficient because a gene will get credit for the contribution of all the other genes as well. Accurately measuring the fitness of individual genes in such a large search space requires many trials. This paper instead proposes turning this single complex search problem into a multi-agent search problem, where each agent has the simpler task of discovering a suitable gene. Gene-specific evaluation functions can then be created that have better theoretical properties than a single evaluation function over all genes. This method is tested in the difficult double-pole balancing problem, showing that agents using gene-specific evaluation functions can create a successful control policy in 20 % fewer trials than the best existing genetic algorithms. The method is extended to more distributed problems, achieving 95 % performance gains over tradition methods in the multi-rover domain. 1.

Title: Dynamic social simulation with multi-agents having internal dynamics
Abstract: . In this paper, we discuss a viewpoint to regard individuals in a society as cognitive agents having internal dynamics, in order to study the dynamic nature of social structures. Internal dynamics is the autonomous changes of an agents internal states that govern his/her behavior. We first discuss the benefit of introducing internal dynamics into a model of humans and the dynamics of society. Then we propose a simple recurrent network with self-influential connection (SRN-SIC) as a model of an agent with internal dynamics. We report the results of our simulation in which the agents play a minority game. In the simulation, we observe the dynamics of the game as a macro structure itinerating among various dynamical states such as fixed points and periodic motions via aperiodic motions. This itinerant change of the macro structures is shown to be induced by the internal dynamics of the agents.

Title: Formal specification of user interface design guidelines
Abstract: Formal specification allows us to design and model the behaviour of computer systems and test their correctness prior to implementation. For any sort of computer system, the problems of being sure you have asked for the right thing (validating the specification against the users requirements) and then being sure you are implementing the right thing (verifying the implementation relative to the specification) are important and hard problems. If the system also has a user interface, which is true in the majority of cases, there are the analogous additional problems of making sure that the interface allows any interaction that is required, and works in a usable way. Graphical user interface design guidelines are used in both the design and evaluation of user interfaces to try and ensure that the systems we build are usable. This project aims to use formal methods to specify systems and their graphical user interfaces and model guidelines for interface design. These will then be used together as the basis for proving the usability properties of a specified system given by the

Abstract: Interface agents are computer programmes that provide assistance to users dealing with computer-based applications. The introduction of agents to user interfaces caused the exploration of new metaphors to enhance user ability to directly manipulate interfaces. In this regard, mixed-initiative interaction refers to a flexible interaction strategy in which agents contribute with users by providing suitable information at the most appropriate time. Mixed-initiative approaches promise to dramatically enhance humancomputer interaction by allowing agents to resemble human assistants. In this paper, we report a study on how the interaction metaphor can affect the user perception of agent capabilities and, in turn, the final success of agents. r 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Title: Invariance-Preserving Abstractions of Hybrid Systems: Application to User Interface Design ?
Abstract: Hybrid systems combine discrete state dynamics which model mode switching, with con-tinuous state dynamics which model physical processes. Hybrid systems can be controlled by affecting both their discrete mode logic and continuous dynamics: in many systems, such as commercial aircraft, these can be controlled both automatically and using manual control. A human interacting with a hybrid system is often presented, through information displays, with a simplified representation of the underlying system. This user interface should not overwhelm the human with unnecessary information, and thus usually contains only a subset of information about the true system model, yet, if properly designed, represents an abstraction of the true system which the human is able to use to safely interact with the system. In safety-critical systems, correct and succinct interfaces are paramount: interfaces must provide adequate infor-mation and must not confuse the user. We present an invariance-preserving abstraction which generates a discrete event system that can be used to analyze, verify, or design user-interfaces

Abstract: The results of a study of two computer games, that use human movement as direct input, were analysed using four existing frameworks and approaches, drawn from different disciplines that relate to interaction and movement. This enabled the exploration of the relationships between bodily actions and the corresponding responses from technology. Interaction analysis, two design frameworks and Laban movement analysis were chosen for their ability to provide different perspectives on human movement in interaction design. Each framework and approach provided a different, yet still useful, perspective to inform the design of movement-based interaction. Each allowed us to examine the interaction between the player and the game technology in quite distinctive ways. Each contributed insights that the others did not.

Title: Fast modular network implementation for support vector machines
Abstract: Support vector machines (SVMs) have been extensively used. However, it is known that SVMs face difficulty in solving large complex problems due to the intensive computation involved in their training algorithms, which are at least quadratic with respect to the number of training examples. This paper proposes a new, simple, and efficient network architecture which consists of several SVMs each trained on a small subregion of the whole data sampling space and the same number of simple neural quantizer modules which inhibit the outputs of all the remote SVMs and only allow a single local SVM to fire (produce actual output) at any time. In principle, this region-computing based modular network method can significantly reduce the learning time of SVM algorithms without sacrificing much generalization performance. The experiments on a few real large complex benchmark problems demonstrate that our method can be significantly faster than single SVMs without losing much generalization performance.

Title: Free-Drop TCP
Abstract: To enhance performance, typical TCP variants propose explicit use of traffic measurements or adjustments to the increase/decrease parameters of the AIMD (additive increase, multiplicative decrease) protocol[7, 3, 13, 6]. We introduce here a new class of TCP congestion control algorithms that take quite a different approach: they modify instead the rule for deciding when to cut the congestion window. The class is defined by an additional window with a packet-count parameter w; the congestion window is reduced by half when a packet loss is detected, at time t say, if and only if there has been at least one dropped packet in the last w packet transmissions prior to time t. An algorithm in the class is called Free-Drop TCP, since dropped packets are free  (they do not cause cuts in the window size) unless they are sufficiently bursty. We propose this new class as a means to achieve higher throughputs in high bandwidth-delay product networks without undue sacrifices in such measures as fairness and coefficients of variation. In terms of the loss probability p, the greater asymptotic throughput for a given window size w is now described by a ?(1/p v w) law rather than the classical ?(1 /  v p) law. The paper begins with an analysis of a fluid model which leads to explicit estimates of the average throughput for small loss probabilities. We then show the results of several experiments, and compare the response curves under the new algorithm to those of TCP. We establish that a family of shifted  response functions of the form O(1 /  v p ? ?) can be obtained over a wide range of p by suitably varying w. Increases in throughput under AIMD must be balanced against possible increases in the variance of the congestion window size, higher rates of congestion events and poorer fairness properties. Experiments are described which suggest that the sacrifices made by FD-TCP for greater throughput are modest at worst.

Title: TCP-Africa: An Adaptive and Fair Rapid Increase Rule for Scalable TCP
Abstract:  High capacity data transfers over the Internet routinely fail to meet end-to-end performance expectations. The default transport control protocol for best effort data traffic is currently TCP, which does not scale well to 100Mbps and higher networks over long distances. In congestion avoidance TCP is not swift enough to fully utilize resources over paths with a high delay bandwidth product. First attempts to alleviate this problem by equipping TCP with increased aggressiveness have shown the disadvantage of poor fairness with the ubiquitous standard TCP-Reno, or in some cases, even among two connections running over the same path. We propose a new delay sensitivecongestion avoidance mode (TCP-Africa) that allows for scalable, aggressive behavior in large underutilized links, yet falls back to the more conservative TCP-Reno algorithm once links become well utilized and congestion is imminent. Through ns2 simulations we argue for the safety, efficiency, and fairness of TCP-Africa. Index Terms  Scalable TCP, high-bandwidth-delay products, TCP fairness

Title: A survey of TCP over Ad Hoc Networks
Abstract: The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) was designed to provide reliable end-to-end delivery of data over unreliable networks. In practice, most TCP deployments have been carefully designed in the context of wired networks. Ignoring the properties of wireless Ad Hoc Networks can lead to TCP implementations with poor performance. In order to adapt TCP to Ad hoc environment, improvements have been proposed in the literature to help TCP to differentiate between the different types of losses. Indeed, in mobile or static Ad hoc networks losses are not always due to network congestion, as it is mostly the case in wired networks. In this report, we present an overview of this issue and a detailed discussion of the major factors involved. In particular, we show how TCP can be affected by mobility and lower layers protocols. In addition, we survey the main proposals which aim at adapting TCP to mobile and static Ad hoc environments.

Title: On the Predictability of Large Transfer TCP Throughput
Abstract: Predicting the throughput of large TCP transfers is important for a broad class of applications. This paper focuses on the design, empirical evaluation, and analysis of TCP throughput predictors. We first classify TCP throughput prediction techniques into two categories: Formula-Based (FB) and History-Based (HB). Within each class, we develop representative prediction algorithms, which we then evaluate empirically over the RON testbed. FB prediction relies on mathematical models that express the TCP throughput as a function of the characteristics of the underlying network path. It does not rely on previous TCP transfers in the given path, and it can be performed with non-intrusive network measurements. We show, however, that the FB method is accurate only if the TCP transfer is window-limited to the point that it does not saturate the underlying path, and explain the main causes of the prediction errors. HB techniques predict the throughput of TCP flows from a time series of previous TCP throughput measurements on the same path, when such a history is available. We show that even simple HB predictors, such as Moving Average and Holt-Winters, using a history of few and sporadic samples, can be quite accurate. On the negative side, HB predictors are highly path-dependent. We explain the cause of such path dependencies based on two key factors: the load on the path and the degree of statistical multiplexing.

Title: On scalable modeling of TCP congestion control mechanism for large-scale IP networks
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an analytic approach of modeling a closed-loop network with multiple feedback loops using fluid-flow approximation. Specifically, we model building blocks of a network (i.e., the congestion control mechanism of TCP, propagation delay of a transmission link, and the buffer of a router) as independent continuous-time systems. By interconnecting these systems, we obtain the model for a complex closed-loop network. We improve the accuracy of analytic models for TCP congestion control and RED router by extending existing fluid-flow models. First, we obtain a block diagram for each continuous-time system using a standard CAD tool widely used in control engineering. Second, we evaluate the performance of a closed-loop network with multiple feedback loops by connecting these block diagrams. We also validate the effectiveness of our analytic approach by comparing our analytic results with simulation results. Unlike other fluid-based modeling approaches, our analytic approach is scalable and accurate; our analytic approach is scalable in terms of the number of TCP connections and routers since both input/output of all continuous-time systems are uniformly defined as a packet transmission rate. Our analytic approach is accurate since the timeout mechanism of TCP and the packet dropping algorithm of RED router are rigorously modeled in our continuous-time systems. 1

Title: Scratchpad memory management for portable systems with a memory management unit
Abstract: In this paper, we present a dynamic scratchpad memory allocation strategy targeting a horizontally partitioned memory subsystem for contemporary embedded processors. The memory subsystem is equipped with a memory management unit (MMU), and physically addressed scratchpad memory (SPM) is mapped into the virtual address space. A small minicache is added to further reduce energy consumption and improve performance. Using the MMUs page fault exception mechanism, we track page accesses and copy frequently executed code sections into the SPM before they are executed. Because the minimal transfer unit between the external memory and the SPM is a single memory page, good code placement is of great importance for the success of our method. Based on profiling information, our postpass optimizer divides the application binary into pageable, cacheable, and uncacheable regions. The latter two are placed at fixed locations in the external memory, and only pageable code is copied on demand to the SPM from the external memory. Pageable code is grouped into sections whose sizes are equal to the physical page size of the MMU. We discuss code grouping techniques and also analyze the effect of the minicache on execution time and energy consumption. We evaluate our SPM allocation strategy with twelve embedded applications, including MPEG-4. Compared to a fully-cached configuration, on average we achieve a 12 % improvement in runtime performance and a 33 % reduction in energy consumption by the memory system.

Title: Semi-automatic region-based memory management for real-time java embedded systems
Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of dynamic memory management in real-time Java embedded systems. Our work aims at suppressing the need for garbage collection in order to avoid unpredictable pause times. For that we use a simple static analysis algorithm coupled with region-based memory management as presented in [15]. To overcome the well-known limitations of region inference, we propose in this paper to involve the developer in the analysis process by providing feedback on programming constructs likely to produce memory leaks. Experiments show that for most programming patterns, our system behaves as efficiently as a garbage collector in terms of memory consumption. Our analysis tool is furthermore able to provide useful feedback to the programmer to pinpoint problematic constructs. 1.

Title: A memory allocation model for an embedded microkernel
Abstract: High-end embedded systems featuring millions of lines of code, with varying degrees of assurance, are becoming commonplace. These devices are typically expected to meet diverse application requirements within tight resource budgets. Their growing complexity makes it increasingly difficult to ensure that they are secure and robust. One approach is to provide strong guarantees of isolation between components  thereby ensuring that the effects of any misbehaviour are confined to the misbehaving component. This paper focuses on an aspect of the systems behaviour that is critical to any such guarantee: management of physical memory resources. In this paper, we present a secure physical memory management model that gives hard guarantees on physical memory consumption. The model dictates the inkernel mechanisms for allocation, however the allocation policy is implemented outside the kernel. We also argue that exporting allocation to user-level provides the flexibility necessary to implement the diverse resource management policies needed in embedded systems, while retaining the high-assurance properties of a formally verified kernel. 1

Title: Isla Vista Heap Sizing: Using Feedback to Avoid Paging
Abstract: Managed runtime environments (MREs) employ garbage collection (GC) for automatic memory management. However, GC induces pressure on the virtual memory (VM) manager, since it may touch pages that are not related to the working set of the application. Paging due to GC can significantly hurt performance, even when the applications working set fits into physical memory. We present a feedback-directed heap resizing mechanism to avoid GC-induced paging, using information from the operating system (OS). We avoid costly GCs when there is physical memory available, and trade off GC for paging when memory is constrained Our mechanism is simple and uses allocation stall events during GC alone to trigger heap resizing, without user participation or OS kernel modification. Our system enables significant performance improvements when real memory is restricted and similar to, or better performance than, the current state-of-the-art MRE, when memory is unconstrained. 1.

Title: External program model checking
Abstract: . To analyze larger models for model checking, external algorithms have shown considerable success in the verification of communication protocols. This paper applies external model checking to software executables. The state in such a verification approach itself is very large, such that main memory hinders the analysis of larger state spaces and calls for I/O efficient exploration algorithms. We propose a general state expanding algorithm based on a search tree skeleton with outsourced states. External collapse traded time for space. Additionally, heuristics accelerate the search process, guide it towards the error and shorten the length of the counterexample. Different caching and exploration strategies are evaluated. We found a counterexample in a C++-program for the Dining Philosophers  problem with 300 philosophers in a successful exploration lasting for over 100 hours while consuming 0.5 gigabytes RAM and 19 gigabytes hard disk. 1

Title: Planning for code buffer management in distributed virtual execution environments
Abstract: Virtual execution environments have become increasingly useful in system implementation, with dynamic translation techniques being an important component for performance-critical systems. Many devices have exceptionally tight performance and memory constraints (e.g., smart cards and sensors in distributed systems), which require effective resource management. One approach to manage code memory is to download code partitions on-demand from a server and to cache the partitions in the resource-constrained device (client). However, due to the high cost of downloading code and re-translation, it is critical to intelligently manage the code buffer to minimize the overhead of code buffer misses. Yet, intelligent buffer management on the tightly constrained client can be too expensive. In this paper, we propose to move code buffer management to the server, where sophisticated schemes can be employed. We describe two schemes that use profiling information to direct the client in caching code partitions. One scheme is designed for workloads with stable run-time behavior, while the other scheme adapts its decisions for workloads with unstable behaviors. We evaluate and compare our schemes and show they perform well, compared to other approaches, with the adaptive scheme having the best performance overall.

Title: Garbage Collection Scheduling for Utility Accrual Real-Time Systems
Abstract: Utility Accrual (UA) scheduling is a method of dynamic real-time scheduling that is de-signed to respond to overload conditions by producing a feasible schedule that heuristically maximizes a pre-defined metric of utility. Whereas utility accrual schedulers have tradition-ally focused on CPU overload, this dissertation explores memory overload conditions during which the aggregate memory demand exceeds a systems available memory bandwidth. Real-time systems are typically implemented in C or other languages that use explicit dy-namic memory management. Taking advantage of modern type-safe languages, such as Java, necessitates the use of garbage collection (GC). The timeliness requirements of real-time systems, however, impose specific demands on the garbage collector. Garbage collection introduces a significant source of unpredictability in the execution timeline of a task because it unexpectedly interjects pauses of arbitrary length, at arbitrary points in time, with an arbitrary frequency. To construct a feasible schedule, a real-time scheduler must have the ability to predict the col-lectors activities and plan for them accordingly. We have devised CADUS (Collector-Aware

Title: Foundations of Process Calculi and Contextual Systems EPSRC Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Proposal Case for support
Abstract: The overall long term aim of the research project is to develop a foundational understanding of the connections between the different ways of specifying the semantics of various process languages for concurrency and mobility. One application of this would be a better understanding of existing process languages, their contextually defined equivalences, and the relationship between their reduction and labelled transition semantics. Further, it will facilitate the development of new process languages and reasoning techniques based not only on syntax, but also on richer structures such as graphs. Such process languages will underlie the future theories of global ubiquitous computing. Foundations of concurrency, mobility and non-deterministic computation have been widely studied in the last 20 years. The traditional approach has been to define simple syntax-based process languages (sometimes referred to as process algebras or process calculi) exhibiting some fundamental aspect of computation. In many cases, the modern presentations of well-known process calculi such as CCS [7] (fundamental notion: simple synchronisation on channel names), the Pi-calculus[8] (fundamental notions: synchronisation with name passing, with the associated notion of scope extrusion) and the Ambient Calculus [2] (fundamental notion: spatial mobility of

Title: On Ontology, ontologies, Conceptualizations, Modeling Languages
Abstract: . In philosophy, the term ontology has been used since the 17 th century to refer both to a philosophical discipline (Ontology with a capital O), and as a domain-independent system of categories that can be used in the conceptualization of domain-specific scientific theories. In the past decades there has been a growing interest in the subject of ontology in computer and information sciences. In the last few years, this interest has expanded considerably in the context of the Semantic Web and MDA (Model-Driven Architecture) research efforts, and due to the role ontologies are perceived to play in these initiatives. In this paper, we explore the relations between Ontology and ontologies in the philosophical sense with domain ontologies in computer science. Moreover, we elaborate on formal characterizations for the notions of ontology, conceptualization and metamodel, as well as on the relations between these notions. Additionally, we discuss a set of criteria that a modeling language should meet in order to be considered a suitable language to model phenomena in a given domain, and present a systematic framework for language evaluation and design. Furthermore, we argue for the importance of ontology in both philosophical senses aforementioned for designing and evaluating a suitable general ontology representation language, and we address the question whether the so-called Ontology Web languages can be considered as suitable general ontology representation languages. Finally, we motivate the need for two complementary classes of modeling languages in Ontology Engineering addressing two separate sets of concerns.

Title: Partial order reduction for rewriting semantics of programming languages
Abstract: Software model checkers are typically language-specific, require substantial development efforts, and are hard to reuse for other languages. Adding partial order reduction (POR) capabilities to such tools typically requires sophisticated changes to the tools model checking algorithms. This paper proposes a new method to make software model checkers language-independent and improving their performance through POR. Getting the POR capabilities does not require making any changes to the underlying model checking algorithms: for each language L, they are instead achieved through a theory transformation RL ? > RL+P OR of Ls formal semantics, rewrite theory RL. Under very minimal assumptions, this can be done for any language L with relatively little effort. Our experiments with the JVM, a Promela-like language and Maude indicate that significant state space reductions and time speedups can be gained for tools generated this way. Key words: Partial order reduction, model checking, programming language semantics, rewriting logic, Maude. 1

Title: Against formal phonology
Abstract: Chomsky and Halle (1968) and many formal linguists rely on the notion of a universally available phonetic space defined in discrete time. This assumption plays a central role in phonological theory. Discreteness at the phonetic level guarantees the discreteness of all other levels of language. But decades of phonetics research demonstrate that there exists no universal inventory of phonetic objects. We discuss three kinds of evidence: first, phonologies differ incommensurably. Second, some phonetic characteristics of languages depend on intrinsically temporal patterns, and, third, some linguistic sound categories within a language are different from each other despite a high degree of overlap that precludes distinctness. Linguistics has mistakenly presumed that speech can always be spelled with letter-like tokens. A variety of implications of these conclusions for research in phonology are discussed.* The generative paradigm of language description (Chomsky 1964, 1965, Chomsky &amp; Halle 1968) has dominated linguistic thinking in the United States for many years. Its specific claims about the phonetic basis of linguistic analysis still provide the cornerstone of most linguistic research. Many criticisms have been raised against the phonetic claims of the Sound pattern of English (Chomsky &amp; Halle 1968), some from early on

Title: Active rules in the Semantic Web: Dealing with language heterogeneity
Abstract: . In the same way as the static  Semantic Web deals with data model and language heterogeneity and semantics that lead to RDF and OWL, there is language heterogeneity and the need for a semantical account concerning Web dynamics. Thus, generic rule markup has to bridge these discrepancies, i.e., allow for composition of component languages, retaining their distinguished semantics and making them accessible e.g. for reasoning about rules. In this paper we analyze the basic concepts for a general language for evolution and reactivity in the Semantic Web. We propose an ontology based on the paradigm of Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rules including an XML markup. In this framework, different languages for events (including languages for composite events), conditions (queries and tests) and actions (including complex actions) can be composed to define highlevel rules for describing behavior in the Semantic Web. 1

Title: A mechanized program verifier
Abstract: . In my view, the verification problem  is the theorem proving problem, restricted to a computational logic. My approach is: adopt a functional programming language, build a general purpose formal reasoning engine around it, integrate it into a program and proof development environment, and apply it to model and verify a wide variety of computing artifacts, usually modeled operationally within the functional programming language. Everything done in this approach is software verification since the models are runnable programs in a subset of an ANSI standard programming language (Common Lisp). But this approach is of interest to proponents of other approaches (e.g., verification of procedural programs or synthesis) because of the nature of the mathematics of computing. I summarize the progress so far using this approach, sketch the key research challenges ahead and describe my vision of the role and shape of a useful verification system. 1

Title: A constructive type-theoretical Interpretation of the philosophical Methods of Abstraction and Instantiation
Abstract: In the philosophical tradition, methodological procedures are often composed rather than simple: classical examples of such structures are the processes of analysis and synthesis and those of abstraction and instantiation. The latter couple is extremely relevant to logical knowledge also in modern formalization, representing the theoretical basis of basic notions such as singular and abstract, and the related ones of individual and concept. What does the philosophical analysis provides in the case of these methods when interpreted within type-theoretical systems? Typed systems present different ways of proceding in abstraction, e.g. polytypic abstraction, data types abstraction and others; on the other hand, the procedure of instantiation is essentially represented either in terms of introduction of constructors or by means of representation of primitive data-types for computation and information processing, or else as the instance of a program within object-oriented programming.

Title: Notions of sameness by default and their application to anaphora, vagueness, and uncertain reasoning. ms., Ben-Gurion University and The Technion
Abstract: We motivate and formalize the idea of sameness by default: two objects are considered the same if they cannot be proved to be different. This idea turns out to be useful for a number of widely different applications, including natural language processing, reasoning with incomplete information, and even philosophical paradoxes. We consider two formalizations of this notion, both of which are based on Reiters Default Logic. The first formalization is a new relation of indistinguishability that is introduced by default. We prove that the corresponding default theory has a unique extension, in which every two objects are indistinguishable if and only if their non-equality cannot be proved from the known facts. We show that the indistinguishability relation has some desirable properties: it is reflexive, symmetric, and, while not transitive, it has a transitive flavor. The second formalization is an extension (modification) of the ordinary language equality by a similar default: two objects are equal if and only if their non-equality cannot be proved from the known facts. It appears to be less elegant from a formal point of view. In particular, it gives rise to multiple extensions. However, this extended equality is better suited for most of the applications discussed in this paper.

Title: Realization of natural language interfaces using lazy functional programming
Abstract: The construction of natural language interfaces to computers continues to be a major challenge. The need for such interfaces is growing now that speech recognition technology is becoming more readily available, and people cannot speak those computer-oriented formal languages that are frequently used to interact with computer applications. Much of the research related to the design and implementation of natural language interfaces has involved the use of high-level declarative programming languages. This is to be expected as the task is extremely difficult, involving syntactic and semantic analysis of potentially ambiguous input. The use of LISP and Prolog in this area is well documented. However, research involving the relatively new lazy functional programming paradigm is less well known. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of that research.

Title: Thesis Proposal (Draft)
Abstract: The goal of my thesis project is to create a framework for encoding and reasoning about functional languages in the Isabelle theorem prover. The framework will encode languages using deep embeddings, with higher-order abstract syntax. The motivating test case is the GHC-Core languagean explicitly-typed, desugared variant of Haskell which is used as an intermediate language by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). My thesis statement consists of two parts: First, that the methodology that I present here is a good general way to formalize languages in a theorem prover. In particular, the framework should scale well enough to handle languages at least as complex as GHC-Core. Second, that using a deep embedding with higher-order abstract syntax facilitates doing proofs about object programs. A successful implementation of the framework should provide a level of proof automation comparable to that provided by other libraries (such as Isabelle/HOLCF domain theory). 1

Title: When and how to develop domain-specific languages
Abstract: Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are languages tailored to a specific application domain. They offer substantial gains in expressiveness and ease of use compared with general purpose programming languages in their domain of application. DSL development is hard, requiring both domain knowledge and language development expertise. Few people have both. Not surprisingly, the decision to develop a DSL is often postponed indefinitely, if considered at all, and most DSLs never get beyond the application library stage. While many articles have been written on the development of particular DSLs, there is very limited literature on DSL development methodologies and many questions remain regarding when and how to develop a DSL. To aid the DSL developer, we identify patterns in the decision, analysis, design, andimplementation phases of DSL development. Our patterns try to improve on and extend earlier work on DSL design patterns, in particular by Spinellis (2001). We also discuss domain analysis tools and language development systems that may help to speed up DSL development. Finally, we state a number of open problems.

Title: Semantic issues of ocl: Past, present, and future
Abstract: We report on the results of a long-term project to formalize the semantics of OCL 2.0 in Higher-order Logic (HOL). The ultimate goal of the project is to provide a formalized, machine-checked semantic basis for a theorem proving environment for OCL (as an example for an objectoriented specification formalism) which is as faithful as possible to the original informal semantics. We report on various (minor) inconsistencies of the OCL semantics, discuss the more recent attempt to align the OCL semantics with UML 2.0 and suggest several extensions which make, in our view, OCL semantics more fit for future extensions towards program verifications and specification refinement, which are, in our view, necessary to make OCL more fit for future extensions. 1

Title: Echo: a practical approach to formal verification
Abstract: Safe operation is crucial to safety-critical systems, and formally verified implementations are desirable. Traditional formal verification approaches follow the Floyd-Hoare style, setting up a direct compliance argument between an abstract formal specification and a concrete implementation. Such approaches require proofs of large numbers of verification conditions. The process of generating and proving verification conditions can require significant skill and can be time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce a general formal verification approach that closely models the Floyd-Hoare pattern, yet avoids the tedious direct compliance proof between the formal specification and the implementation. The approach moves the major proof step to a point between two abstract specifications. Our preliminary design takes PVS as our specification language and SPARK Ada as our implementation language. We first use a human-guided refinement to manually generate Ada code along with appropriate SPARK annotations from a PVS specification. We then verify the annotations  compliance with the specification by (1) mechanically extracting a PVS specification from them, and (2) proving that properties of the generated specification imply all of the properties of the original. We rely on the existing SPARK toolset to verify the Ada code against the SPARK annotations. The process is largely automatic or computer-aided. A case study using a hypothetical avionics system provides a preliminary indication that this approach is feasible and practical.

Title: Planar languages and learnability
Abstract: . Strings can be mapped into Hilbert spaces using feature maps such as the Parikh map. Languages can then be defined as the preimage of hyperplanes in the feature space, rather than using grammars or automata. These are the planar languages. In this paper we show that using techniques from kernel-based learning, we can represent and efficiently learn, from positive data alone, various linguistically interesting context-sensitive languages. In particular we show that the cross-serial dependencies in Swiss German, that established the non-context-freeness of natural language, are learnable using a standard kernel. We demonstrate the polynomial-time identifiability in the limit of these classes, and discuss some language theoretic properties of these classes, and their relationship to the choice of kernel/feature map. 1

Title: The computational soundness of formal indistinguishability and static equivalence
Abstract: . In the research of the relationship between the formal and the computational view of cryptography, a recent approach, first proposed in [9], uses static equivalence from cryptographic pi calculi as a notion of formal indistinguishability. Previous work [9, 1] has shown that this yields the soundness of natural interpretations of some interesting equational theories, such as certain cryptographic operations and a theory of XOR. In this paper however, we argue that static equivalence is too coarse for sound interpretations of equational theories in general. We show some explicit examples how static equivalence fails to work in interesting cases. To fix this problem, we propose a notion of formal indistinguishability that is more flexible than static equivalence. We provide a general framework along with general theorems, and then discuss how this new notion works for the explicit examples where static equivalence failed to ensure soundness. We also improve the treatment by using ordered sorts in the formal view, and by allowing arbitrary probability distributions of the interpretations. 1

Title: 2005 Context and Ontologies: Contextual Indexing of Ontological Expressions
Abstract: This paper discusses aspects of context as applied to ontologies. In particular, we note some formalizations of context that have been applied to ontologies such as Menzel (1999) and Akman &amp; Surov (1996, 1997), that have largely been framed in terms of theories such as Situation Theory (Barwise &amp; Perry, 1983) which originated in natural language semantics. We also mention the notion of labeled deduction (Gabbay, 1996) and speculate on its prospective use in the contextualizing of ontologies. The latter can be viewed as a mechanism for annotating ontological assertions and proofs with contextual information about provenance, security, strength/confidence of assertion, and aspects of policy. Labeled deduction correlates one or more logics, with one logic addressing the primary assertion or

Title: Sequences as a basis for pattern language composition
Abstract: Pattern Languages have begun to appear and mature as a presentation of the structures and processes that support the building of complex software systems. A pattern language describes how to compose structures in a particular domain such as telecommunications, client-server architecture, or object-oriented programming, to achieve system-level architectures that are greater than the sum of their parts. A problem lurks on the horizon: How do you compose patterns from multiple domainsfrom multiple pattern languagesin a single system? For example, today there is nothing other than an ad-hoc approach to combining the pattern languages for telecommunications and for object-oriented design to build objectoriented telecommunications systems from the respective pattern languages. To understand the solution to this dilemma, it pays to examine sequences: an important aspect of pattern application that is often overlooked. Sequences are the loci of concern about interleaving patterns, whether from a single pattern language or multiple pattern languages. Sequences are critical because pattern languages represent longterm archives of the rhythms of critical, recurring sequences. Key words:

Title: Towards formalizing categorical models of type theory in type theory
Abstract: This note is about work in progress on the topic of internal type theory  where we investigate the internal formalization of the categorical metatheory of constructive type theory in (an extension of) itself. The basic notion is that of a category with families, a categorical notion of model of dependent type theory. We discuss how to formalize the notion of category with families inside type theory and how to build initial categories with families. Initial categories with families will be term models which play the role of canonical syntax for dependent type theory. We also discuss the formalization of the result that categories with finite limits give rise to categories with families. This yields a type-theoretic perspective on Curiens work on substitution up to isomorphism. Our formalization is being carried out in the proof assistant Agda 2 developed at Chalmers. 1

Title: Formal and informal software specifications
Abstract: The topic of this thesis is to bridge the gap between formal and informal software specifications. Formal specifications are required for the use of formal methods to verify the correctness of software. If we expect formal methods to be used in realistic software development projects, we need to enable people with varying levels of familiarity with formal specification languages to understand, maintain and create formal specifications. To address these problems, we provide a tool for translating specifications written in the formal language OCL, a substandard of UML, to natural language. We also provide a multilingual, syntax-directed editor where OCL and natural language specifications can be edited in parallel. The implementation of our work is to a large extent based on the Grammatical Framework (GF). GF is a grammar formalism based on type theory, which provides a special purpose language for defining grammars, and a compiler for this language. We have developed a GF grammar for specifications

Title: Multilingual RDF and OWL
Abstract: . RDF uses the RFC3066 standard for language tags for literals in natural languages. The revision RFC3066bis includes productive use of language, country and script codes. These form an implicit ontology of natural languages for marking-up texts. Relating each language tag with classes of appropriately tagged literals allows this implicit ontology to be made explicit as an ontology in OWL in which every class in the ontology is a datarange. The treatment extends to XML Literals, which may have multiple embedded language tags. Further features of RFC3066bis such as the relationship with deprecated codes, language ranges and language tag fallback can be expressed in OWL. A small change to the RDF model theory is suggested to permit access to the language tag in the formal semantics, giving this ontology a precise formal meaning. Illustrative use cases refer to use of English, Japanese, Chinese and Klingon texts. 1

Title: Abstract: Architectural Styles of Extensible REST-based Applications
Abstract: At the beginning of the World Wide Web (WWW or Web), there was no clear set of principles to guide the decisions being made by developers and architects. In these early days, a cacophony emerged without a clear direction to guide the evolution of the Web. If there was any direction during the inception of the Web, it was a weak focus on how communication might occur between machines on the Web and the content that was to be transferred. Within a matter of a few years, scalability and other design concerns threatened the future of the early Web- this led to the introduction of REpresentation State Transfer architectural style (REST). The REST style imposed constraints on the exchange of communication over the Web and provided guidance for further modifications to the underlying protocols. The introduction of REST, through the HTTP/1.1 protocol, restored order to the Web by articulating the necessary constraints required for participation.

Abstract: Phishing is a form of online identity theft that aims to steal sensitive information such as online banking passwords and credit card information from users. Phishing scams have been receiving extensive press coverage because such attacks have been escalating in number and sophistication. According to a study by Gartner, 57 million US Internet users have identified the receipt of e-mail linked to phishing scams and about 2 million of them are estimated to have been tricked into giving away sensitive information. This paper presents a novel browser extension, AntiPhish, that aims to protect users against spoofed web site-based phishing attacks. To this end, AntiPhish tracks the sensitive information of a user and generates warnings whenever the user attempts to give away this information to a web site that is considered untrusted.

We define the concept of a conjecturalequilibrium, where all agents' expectations are realized, and eachagent responds optimally to its expectations. We present a genericmultiagent exchange situation, in which competitive behaviorconstitutes a conjectural equilibrium. We then introduce an agentthat executes a more sophisticated strategic learning strategy,building a model of the response of other agents. We find that thesystem reliably converges to a conjectural equilibrium, but that thefinal result achieved is highly sensitive to initial belief. Inessence, the strategic learner's actions tend to fulfill itsexpectations. Depending on the starting point, the agent may bebetter or ...

Title: Learning in Distributed Systems and Multi-Agent Environments
Abstract: The paper begins with the discussion on why we should be concernedwith machine learningin the context of distributed AI. The rest of the paper is dedicatedto various problems ofmulti-agent learning. First, a common framework for comparingdifferent existing systems ispresented. It is pointed out that it is useful to distinguish whenthe individual agentscommunicate. Some systems communicate during the learning phase,others during theproblem solving phase, for example. It is also important to considerhow, that is in whatlanguage, the communication is established. The paper analysesseveral systems in thisframework. Particular attention is paid to previous work done by theauthors in this area. Thepaper covers use of redundant knowledge, knowledge integration,evaluation of hypothesisby a community of agents and resolution of language differencesbetween agents.Keywords: learning in distributed systems, multi-agent learning,evaluation of hypotheses,knowledge integration, ...

Title: Sequential Auctions for the Allocation of Resources with Complementarities
Abstract: Market-based mechanisms such as auctions are being studiedas an appropriate means for resource allocation in distributedand multiagent decision problems. When agents value resourcesin combination rather than in isolation, one generallyrelies on combinatorial auctions where agents bid for resourcebundles, or simultaneous auctions for all resources. Wedevelop a different model, where agents bid for required resources sequentially. This model has the advantage that it canbe applied in settings where combinatorial and simultaneousmodels are infeasible (e.g., when resources are made availableat different points in time by different parties), as well as certainbenefits in settings where combinatorial models are applicable.We develop a dynamic programming model for agentsto compute bidding policies based on estimated distributionsover prices. We also describe how these distributions are updatedto provide a learning model for bidding behavior.1 IntroductionA great deal of att...

Title: Improved Algorithms for Optimal Winner Determination in Combinatorial Auctions and Generalizations
Abstract: ffiCombinatorial auctions can be used to reach efficient resource andtask allocations in multiagent systems where the items arecomplementary. Determining the winners is NP-complete andinapproximable, but it was recently shown that optimal searchalgorithms do very well on average. This paper presents a moresophisticated search algorithm for optimal (and anytime) winnerdetermination, including structural improvements that reduce searchtree size, faster data structures, and optimizations at search nodesbased on driving toward, identifying and solving tractable specialcases. We also uncover a more general tractable special case, anddesign algorithms for solving it as well as for solving knowntractable special cases substantially faster. We generalizecombinatorial auctions to multiple units of each item, to reserveprices on singletons as well as combinations, and to combinatorialexchanges -- all allowing for substitutability. Finally, we presentalgorithms for d...

Title: A Kernel-Oriented Model for Coalition-Formation in General Environments: Implementation and Results
Abstract: In this paper we present a model for coalition formationand payoff distribution in general environments.We focus on a reduced complexity kernel-orientedcoalition formation model, and provide a detailed algorithmfor the activity of the single rational agent. Themodel is partitioned into a social level and a strategiclevel, to distinguish between regulations that must beagreed upon and are forced by agent-designers, andstrategies by which each agent acts at will. In addition,we present an implementation of the model andsimulation results. From these we conclude that implementingthe model for coalition formation amongagents increases the benefits of the agents with reasonabletime consumption. It also shows that morecoalition formations yield more benefits to the agents.IntroductionAn important method for cooperation in multi-agentenvironments is coalition formation.

Title: AgenTalk: Coordination Protocol Description for Multiagent Systems
Abstract: This paper presents the basic concepts behindAgenTalk, a language used for describing coordinationprotocols in multiagent systems. Many coordinationprotocols such as the contract net protocol havebeen proposed, and many application specific coordinationprotocols are expected to be required as soon asbuilding of more software agents begins. Thus, a languagefor defining and implementing such coordinationprotocols plays a crucial role in the developmentof multiagent systems. By incorporating an inheritancemechanism, AgenTalk allows coordination protocolsto be incrementally defined and easily customizedto suit application domains. Its capability is demonstratedby describing the contract net and multistagenegotiation protocols in AgenTalk using its inheritancemechanism.

Title: Generating and Solving Imperfect Information Games
Abstract: Work on game playing in AI has typically ignoredgames of imperfect information such as poker. Inthis paper, we present a framework for dealing withsuch games. We point out several important issuesthat arise only in the context of imperfect informationgames, particularly the insufficiency of asimple game tree model to represent the players'information state and the need for randomization inthe players' optimal strategies. We describe Gala,an implemented system that provides the user with avery natural and expressive language for describinggames. From a game description, Gala creates anaugmented game tree with information sets whichcan be used by various algorithms in order to findoptimal strategies for that game. In particular, Galaimplements the first practical algorithm for findingoptimal randomized strategies in two-player imperfectinformation competitive games [Koller et al.,1994] .

Title: Coupling application design and user interface design
Abstract: Building an interactive application requires, amongst otheractivities, the design of both a data model and a user interface.These two designs are often done separately, frequentlyby different individuals or groups. However, thereare strong similarities between the objects, actions and attributesof the data model and those of the user interface.This means that considerable specification work has to bedone twice. Our approach is to automatically generate userinterface elements directly from the data model. This savestime and effort and at the same time style rules can be appliedautomatically to the design of the user interface. Thisrelieves the designer of the need to be familiar with certainstyle rules, while at the same time creating the consistencyembodied in the rules.IntroductionAn early step in the design of an interactive application isthe definition of the application's data model.

In manyofsuch applications timely response by a CSP solver is so crucial thattoachieve it, the user may be willing to sacrifice completeness to acertainextent. This paper describes a neural network approach for solvingCSPs which aims at providing prompt responses. The effectiveness ofthis model, which is called GENET, in solving CSPs with binaryconstraints is demonstrated by a simulator. Although the completenessis not guaranteed, as in the case of most of the existing stochasticsearchtechniques, solutions have been found by the GENET simulator in allofour randomly generated problems tested so far. Since the neuralnetworkmodel lends itself to the VLSI implementation of parallel processingarchitectures, the limited number of cycles required by GENET to findthe solutions for the tested problems gives hope for solving largeCSPsin a fraction of the tim...

In effect, the informationprovided by the training signal for each taskserves as a domain-specific inductive bias for theother tasks. Frequentlythe worldgives us clustersof related tasks to learn. When it does not, it is oftenstraightforward to create additional tasks. Formany domains, acquiring inductive bias by collectingadditional teaching signal may be morepractical than the traditional approach of codifyingdomain-specific biases acquired from humanexpertise. We call this approach MultitaskLearning(MTL). Since much of the power of an inductivelearner follows directly from its inductivebias, multitask learning may yield more powerfullearning. An empirical example of multitaskconnectionist learning is presented where learningimproves by training one network on severalrelated tasks at the same time.

Abstract: An algorithm that learns from a set of examples should ideally beable to exploit the available resources of (a) abundant computingpower and (b) domain-specific knowledge to improve its ability togeneralize. Connectionist theory-refinement systems, which usebackground knowledge to select a neural network's topology andinitial weights, have proven to be effective at exploitingdomain-specific knowledge; however, most do not exploit availablecomputing power. This weakness occurs because they lack the abilityto refine the topology of the neural networks they produce, therebylimiting generalization, especially when given impoverished domaintheories.

Title: Incremental evolution of neural network architectures for adaptive behaviour
Abstract: This paper describes aspects of our ongoing work in evolvingrecurrent dynamicalartificial neural networks which act as sensory-motor controllers,generating adaptivebehaviour in artificial agents. We start with a discussion of therationale for ourapproach. Our approach involves the use of recurrent networks ofartificial neuronswith rich dynamics, resilience to noise (both internal and external);and separateexcitation and inhibition channels. The networks allow artificialagents (simulated orrobotic) to exhibit adaptive behaviour. The complexity of designingnetworks builtfrom such units leads us to use our own extended form of geneticalgorithm, whichallows for incremental automatic evolution of controller-networks.Finally, we reviewsome of our recent results, applying our methods to work with simplevisually-guidedrobots. The genetic algorithm generates useful network architecturesfrom an initialset of randomly-connected networks. During evolution, uniform noisewas a...

Title: On the Analysis of Pattern Sequences by Self-Organizing Maps
Abstract: This thesis is organized in three parts. In the first part, theSelf-Organizing Map algorithm is introduced. The discussion focuseson the analysis of the Self-Organizing Map algorithm. It is shownthat the nonlinear nature of the algorithm makes it difficult toanalyze the algorithm except in some trivial cases. In the secondpart the Self-Organizing Map algorithm is applied to several patternssequence analysis tasks. The first application is a voice qualityanalysis system. It is shown that the Self-Organizing Map algorithmcan be applied to voice analysis by providing the visualization ofcertain deviations. The key point in the applicability ofSelf-Organizing Map algorithm is the topological nature of themapping; similar voice samples are mapped to nearby locations in themap. The second application is a speech recognition system. Throughseveral experiments it is demonstrated that by collecting some timedependent features and using them in conjunction with the basicSelf-Organ...

Title: Prediction of human mRNA donor and acceptor sites from the DNA sequence
Abstract: Artificial neural networks have been applied to the prediction ofsplice site location in human pre--mRNA. A joint prediction schemewhere prediction of transition regions between introns and exonsregulates a cutoff level for splice site assignment was able topredict splice site locations with confidence levels far better thanpreviously reported in the literature. The problem of predictingdonor and acceptor sites in human genes is hampered by the presenceof numerous amounts of false positives --- in the paper thedistribution of these false splice sites is examined and linked to apossible scenario for the splicing mechanism in vivo. When thepresented method detects 95% of the true donor and acceptor sites itmakes less than 0.1% false donor site assignments and less than 0.4%false acceptor site assignments. For the large data set used in thisstudy this means that on the average there are one and a half falsedonor sites per true donor site and six false acceptor sites pertrue...

Title: Genetic Set Recombination and its Application to Neural Network Topology Optimisation
Abstract: Forma analysis is applied to the task of optimising the connectivityof a feed-forward neural network with a single layer of hidden units.This problem is reformulated as a multiset optimisation problem andtechniques are developed to allow principled genetic search overfixed- and variable-size sets and multisets. These techniques requirea further generalisation of the notion of gene, which is presented.The result is a non-redundant representation of the neural networktopology optimisation problem together with recombination operatorswhich have carefully designed and well-understood properties. Thetechniques developed have relevance to the application of geneticalgorithms to constrained optimisation problems. 1 Introduction Whilegenetic algorithms have been applied to a number of problems inneural networks, there are severe difficulties with this endeavour.This is significant for two reasons.

Abstract: This report studies a statistical skin-color model and itsadaptation. By quantitative analysisand goodness-of-fit test, we reveal that (1) skin-color differencesamong people can bereduced by intensity normalization, and (2) under a certain lightingcondition, a skin-colordistribution can be characterized by a multivariate normaldistribution in the normalizedcolor space. We then propose an adaptive model to characterize humanskin-color distributionsfor locating human faces under different lighting conditions. Theparameters of themodel are adapted by a linear combination of the known parameters.The maximum likelihoodcriterion has been used to obtain the optimal estimation of thecoefficients. The modelhas been successfully applied to a real-time face tracker and otherapplications.1 IntroductionHuman face perception is currently an active research area in thecomputer vision community.Locating and tracking human faces is a prerequisite for facerecognition and/or faci...

Title: Incorporating Information From Syllable-length Time Scales into Automatic Speech Recognition
Abstract: Incorporating the concept of the syllable into speech recognition mayimproverecognition accuracy through the integration of information oversyllable-length timespans. Evidence from psychoacoustics and phonology suggests thathumans use thesyllable as a basic perceptual unit. Nonetheless, the explicit use ofsuch long-timespanunits is comparatively unusual in automatic speech recognitionsystems forEnglish. The work described in this thesis explored the utility ofinformation collectedover syllable-related time-scales. The first approach involvedintegrating syllablesegmentation information into the speech recognition process. Theaddition ofacoustically-based syllable onset estimates [184] resulted in a 10%relative reduction inword-error rate. The second approach began with developing fourspeech recognitionsystems based on long-time-span features and units, includingmodulation spectrogramfeatures [80]. Error analysis suggested the strategy of combining,which led tothe...

Wedescribe a novel method to combine different knowledgesources and estimate the confidence in a word hypothesis,via a neural network.

INTRODUCTIONIn the last few years, a lot of research has been devoted tothe development of confidence scores associated with theoutputs of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems.These scores were used mostly to help spot keywords inspontaneous or read texts, and to provide a basis for therejection of out-of-vocabulary words (e.g. [4-11]). Manyother ASR applications could also benefit from knowingthe level of confidence in correct recognition.

Abstract: For distributed and network applications, efficient managementof program state is critical to performance and functionality.To support domain- and application-specific optimizationof data movement, we have developed the InternetBackplane Protocol (IBP) for controlling storage thatis implemented as part the network fabric itself. IBP allowsan application to control intermediate data staging operationsexplicitly as data is communicated between processes.As such, the application can exploit locality andmanage scarce buffer resources effectively. In this paper,we discuss the development of IBP, the implementationof a prototype system for managing network storage,and a preliminary deployment as part of the Internet-2 DistributedStorage Initiative.1 IntroductionThe proliferation of applications that are performance limitedby network speeds leads us to explore new ways toexploit data locality in distributed settings.

Abstract: Unlike wired links, wireless network bandwidth is highly limitedand the channel usually suffers from frequent and bursty loss dueto its vulnerability to various kinds of interference. At the sametime, the traditional TCP with its congestion control is well knownfor its poor performance over wireless links. This paper proposesa new protocol that (1) replaces TCP/IP over the wireless link bya simpler protocol with smaller headers, if the link is the last hopalong a data path, (2) shifts functions needed to communicate withan Internet host using TCP/IP from the mobile host to the basestation, so that the distinct wireless link is hidden from theoutsideInternet, and (3) exploits link-layer acknowledgments andretransmissionsto quickly recover losses over the wireless link. Oursimulation results show a substantial performance improvementachieved by the new protocol.1 IntroductionRecently, the emergence of the World Wide Web as a major mediaall over the world and the explo...

Title: Soft state header compression for wireless networks
Abstract: Low-speed wireless is becoming a popular way toconnect mobile computers to the Internet and othernetworks. Users will desire the same services on lowspeed links as they already have on higher speed networks.Since bandwidth will probably always be a limitationon wide area wireless links, protocol mechanismsneed to be developed to use the available bandwidthon low speed networks efficiently. In the face ofgrowing address sizes, such as those in IPv6, we offera header compression scheme that enables efficient useof bandwidth when packets are small. The scheme usessoft state, works over simplex links, supports multicasttransmission for real time applications, and besidesproviding more usable bandwidth on wireless links, allowsbetter utilization of gateways and servers attachedto wireless networks.1 IntroductionIn the future, many end systems will be attached tothe global Internet over relatively low-speed wirelesslinks.

Abstract: Techniques for avoiding the high memory overheadsfound on many modern shared-memory multiprocessorsare of increasing importance in the development ofhigh-performance multiprocessor protocol implementations.One such technique is processor-cache affinity scheduling,which can significantly lower packet latency and substantiallyincrease protocol processing throughput [30]. In thispaper, we evaluate several aspects of the effectiveness ofaffinity-based scheduling in multiprocessor network protocolprocessing, under packet-level and connection-level parallelizationapproaches. Specifically, we evaluate the performanceof the scheduling technique 1) when a large numberof streams are concurrently supported, 2) when processingincludes copying of uncached packet data, 3) as appliedto send-side protocol processing, and 4) in the presenceof stream burstiness and source locality, two well-knownproperties of network traffic.

Title: Software Infrastructure for the I-WAY High-Performance Distributed Computing Experiment

However, there is as yet little understanding of thehigher-level services required to support these applications, or ofthe techniques required to implement these services in a scalable,secure manner. We report on a large-scale prototyping effort that hasyielded some insights into these issues.

Title: The Concept of Relevant Time Scales and Its Application to Queuing Analysis of Self-Similar Traffic (or Is Hurst Naughty or Nice?)
Abstract: Recent traffic analyses from various packet networks haveshown the existence of long-range dependence in bursty traffic.In evaluating its impact on queuing performance, earlierinvestigations have noted how the presence of long-range dependence,or a high value of the Hurst parameter H, is oftenassociated with surprisingly large queue sizes. As a result, acommon impression has been created of expecting queuingperformance to be worse as H increases, but this impressioncan be misleading. In fact, there are examples in whichlarger values of H are associated with smaller queues. So thequestion is how can one tell whether queuing performancewould improve or degrade as H rises? In this paper, weshow that the relative queuing performance can be assessedby identifying a couple of time scales. First, in comparinga high-H process with a low-H process, there is a uniquetime scale tm at which the variances of the two processesmatch (assuming exact, second-order self similarity for bo...

Abstract: In this paper, we report on some preliminary results from anin-depth, wavelet-basedanalysis of a set of high-quality, packet-level traffic measurements,collected over the last6-7 years from a number of different working wide-area networks(WANs). We first validateand confirm an earlier finding, originally due to Paxson and Floyd[10], that actual WANtraffic is consistent with statistical self-similarity forsufficiently large time scales. Second,we illustrate that TCP traffic characteristics have undergone majorchanges within the last3-4 years, because of the increasing popularity of the Web (WWW) andits emergence asthe major contributor to WAN traffic. Finally, we provide empiricalevidence that actualWAN traffic traces also exhibit scaling properties over small timescales, but that thesmall-time scaling phenomenon is distinctly different from theobserved large-time scalingproperty. We relate this newly observed characteristic of WAN trafficto the effects thatthe dom...

Title: Polymorphic Type Reconstruction for Garbage Collection Without Tags
Abstract: Several papers ([Appel89],[Goldberg91]) have recentlyclaimed that garbage collection can be performedon untagged data in the presence of ML-style type polymorphism.They rely on the ability to reconstruct thetype of any reachable object during garbage collection.The bad news is that this is false -- there can be reachableobjects in the program whose type cannot be determinedby the garbage collector. The good news is that tag-freegarbage collection can be performed anyway -- any objectwhose type cannot be determined by the collector is,in fact, garbage. Such objects can be discarded by thecollector. This is the key result of this paper.We present a type reconstruction algorithm that candetermine the type of any non-garbage object. Unfortunately,the implementation of the tag-free collector for apolymorphically typed language is difficult in ways thatwere not described in the previous papers, and we addresssome implementation issues as well.

Title: Concurrent compacting garbage collection of a persistent heap
Abstract: We describe a replicating garbage collector for a persistentheap. The garbage collector cooperates with a transactionmanager to provide safe and efficient transactional storagemanagement. Clients read and write the heap in primarymemory and can commit or abort their write operations.When write operations are committed they are preserved instable storage and survive system failures. Clients can freelyaccess the heap during garbage collection because the collectorconcurrently builds a compact replica of the heap. A logcaptures client write operations and is used to support boththe transaction manager and the replicating garbage collector.Our implementation is the first to provide concurrent andcompacting garbage collection of a persistent heap. Measurementsshow that concurrent replicating collection producessignificantly shorter pause times than stop-and-copy collection.For small transactions, throughput is limited by the loggingbandwidth of the underlying log manager. The resultssuggest that replicating garbage collection offers a flexibleand efficient way to provide automatic storage managementin transaction systems, object-oriented databases and persistentprogramming environments.

Abstract: Research results show that while LogStructured File Systems (LFS)offer the potential for dramatically improved file systemperformance, the cleaner can seriously degrade performance, by asmuch as 40% in transaction processing workloads [9]. Our goal is toexamine trace data from live file systems and use those to derivesimple heuristics that will permit the cleaner to run withoutinterfering with normal file access.

Since thisrids the system of seeks during writing, the potential performance ofsuch a system is much greater than in the standard Fast File System[4], which must make writes to several different locations on thedisk for common operations such as file creation.

Title: Alias Types for Recursive Data Structures
Abstract: Linear type systems permit programmers to deallocate orexplicitly recycle memory, but they are severly restricted bythe fact that they admit no aliasing. This paper describesa pseudo-linear type system that allows a degree of aliasingand memory reuse as well as the ability to define complexrecursive data structures. Our type system can encodeconventional linear data structures such as linear lists andtrees as well as more sophisticated data structures includingcyclic and doubly-linked lists and trees. In the latter cases,our type system is expressive enough to represent pointeraliasing and yet safely permit destructive operations such asobject deallocation. We demonstrate the flexibility of ourtype system by encoding two common compiler optimizations:destination-passing style and Deutsch-Schorr-Waiteor "link-reversal" traversal algorithms.

Title: Linear Continuations
Abstract: We present a functional interpretation of classical linearlogic based on the concept of linear continuations.Unlike their non-linear counterparts, such continuationslead to a model of control that does not inherently imposeany particular evaluation strategy. Instead, suchadditional structure is expressed by admitting closelycontrolled copying and discarding of continuations. Wealso emphasize the importance of classicality in obtainingcomputationally appealing categorical models of linearlogic and propose a simple "coreflective subcategory" interpretation of the modality "!".1 IntroductionIn recent years, there has been considerable interestin applications of Girard's Linear Logic (LL) [Gir87]to programming language design and implementation.Over time, various more or less mutated versions of theoriginal system have been proposed, but they all sharethe same basic premise: that assumptions made in thecourse of a formal proof can not necessarily be used anarbitrary n...

Title: Efficient optimistic concurrency control using loosely synchronized clocks
Abstract: This paper describes an efficient optimistic concurrency controlscheme for use in distributed database systems in which objects arecached and manipulated at client machines while persistent storageand transactional support are provided by servers. The schemeprovides both serializability and external consistency for committedtransactions; it uses loosely synchronized clocks to achieve globalserialization. It stores only a single version of each object, andavoids maintaining any concurrency control information on a perobjectbasis; instead, it tracks recent invalidations on a per-client basis,an approach that has low in-memory space overhead and no per-objectdisk overhead. In addition to its low space overheads, the schemealso performs well. The paper presents a simulation study thatcompares the scheme to adaptive callback locking, the bestconcurrency control scheme for client-server object-oriented databasesystems studied to date. The study shows that our schemeoutperforms...

Title: Closing the Window of Vulnerability in Multiphase Memory Transactions
Abstract: Multiprocessor architects have begun to explore several mechanismssuch as prefetching,context-switching and software-assisted dynamic cache-coherence,which transformsingle-phase memory transactions in conventional memory systems intomultiphaseoperations. Multiphase operations introduce a window of vulnerabilityin whichdata can be invalidated before it is used. Losing data due toinvalidations introducesdamaging livelock situations. This thesis discusses the origins ofthe window of vulnerabilityand proposes an architectural framework that closes it. The frameworkemploysfully-associative transaction-buffers and an algorithm calledthrashlock.

Title: A High-Throughput Secure Reliable Multicast Protocol
Abstract: A (secure) reliable multicast protocol enables a process to multicasta message to a group of processesin a way that ensures that all honest destination-group membersreceive the same message,even if some group members and the multicast initiator aremaliciously faulty. Reliable multicasthas been shown to be useful for building multiparty cryptographicprotocols and secure distributedservices. We present a high-throughput reliable multicast protocolthat tolerates the malicious behaviorof up to fewer than one-third of the group members. Our protocolachieves high-throughputusing a novel technique for chaining multicasts, whereby the cost ofensuring agreement on eachmulticast message is amortized over many multicasts. This is coupledwith a novel flow-controlmechanism that yields low multicast latency.1.

Title: Evolving Turing-Complete Programs for a Register Machine with Self-modifying Code
Abstract: The majority of commercial computers today are register machines ofvon Neumann type. We have developed a method to evolveTuring-complete programs for a register machine. The describedimplementation enables the use of most program constructs, such asarithmetic operators, large indexed memory, automatic decompositioninto subfunctions and subroutines (ADFs), conditional constructs i.e.if-then-else, jumps, loop structures, recursion, protected functions,string and list functions. Any C-function can be compiled and linkedinto the function set of the system. The use of register machinelanguage allows us to work at the lowest level of binary machine codewithout any interpreting steps. In a von Neumann machine, programsand data reside in the same memory and the genetic operators can thusdirectly manipulate the binary machine code in memory. The geneticoperators themselves are written in C-language but they modifyindividuals in binary representation. The result is an executionspe...

Title: Garbage Collection and Local Variable Type-Precision and Liveness in Java Virtual Machines
Abstract: . Full precision in garbage collection implies retainingonly those heap allocated objects that will actually be used in thefuture.Since full precision is not computable in general, garbage collectorsuse safe (i.e., conservative) approximations such as reachabilityfrom a set of root references. Ambiguous roots collectors(commonly called "conservative") can be overly conservativebecausethey overestimate the root set, and thereby retain unexpectedlylarge amounts of garbage. We consider two more precise collectionschemes for Java virtual machines (JVMs). One uses a typeanalysis to obtain a type-precise root set (only those variables thatcontain references); the other adds a live variable analysis toreducethe root set to only the live reference variables. Even with the Javaprogramming language's strong typing, it turns out that the JVMspecification has a feature that makes type-precise root setsdifficultto compute.

Title: Multiversion Query Locking
Abstract: Multiversion two-phase locking (MV2PL) has been incorporated in somecommercial transactionprocessing systems to support the serializable execution of queries.A drawback to this algorithmis the potentially high cost that it adds to maintain and accessprior versions of data. In this paper,we present a new multiversion locking algorithm, multiversion querylocking (MVQL), thatreduces the cost of versioning by accepting weaker forms ofconsistency for queries than MV2PL.Nevertheless, queries are guaranteed to see transaction-consistentdata. We present results from adetailed performance study that show that, under a wide range ofconditions, MVQL provides higherthroughput to queries and update transactions with a lower storagecost than MV2PL. In the worstcase, the performance of MVQL approaches that of MV2PL.1.

Title: Data-Oriented Language Processing: An Overview
Abstract: Data-oriented models of language processing embody the assumptionthat human languageperception and production works with representations of concrete pastlanguage experiences,rather than with abstract grammar rules. Such models thereforemaintain large corpora oflinguistic representations of previously occurring utterances. Whenprocessing a new inpututterance, analyses of this utterance are constructed by combiningfragments from the corpus;the occurrence-frequencies of the fragments are used to estimatewhich analysis is the mostprobable one. This paper motivates the idea of data-oriented languageprocessing by consideringthe problem of syntactic disambiguation. One relatively simpleparsing/disambiguation modelthat implements this idea is described in some detail. This modelassumes a corpus of utterancesannotated with labelled phrase-structure trees, and parses new inputby combining subtrees fromthe corpus; it selects the most probable parse of an input utteranceby con...

Title: On Probabilistic Model Checking
Abstract: We give a probabilistic semantics to formulas of the modalmu-calculus, where modelsare probabilistic transition systems and meanings are functions fromstates to the unitinterval. The meaning of a formula OE in a state q is thus theprobability that OE holds inq. We relate the new semantics to the standard Boolean one overlabeled transitionsystems. Combining hai or x with [a] or x generally createsdifferences to theclassical interpretation which allow one to verify liveness andfairness properties ofprobabilistic transition systems. The \Sigma-algebra of our semanticsis bicontinuous. Wepoint out how our approach differs from the syntax and semantics ofPML due toLarsen & Skou. We give a co-inductive definition of probabilisticbisimulation andshow that its greatest fixed point is a probabilistic bisimulation;in fact, it is the unionof all those in the sense of Larsen & Skou. Probabilisticallybisimilar states yield thesame probabilities in our semantics for all formul...

Title: Parametricity and Local Variables
Abstract: We propose that the phenomenon of local state may be understood interms of Strachey's concept of parametric (i.e., uniform) polymorphism. The intuitivebasis for ourproposal is the following analogy: a non-local procedure isindependent of locally-declaredvariables in the same way that a parametrically polymorphic functionis independent oftypes to which it is instantiated.A connection between parametricity and representational abstractionwas first suggestedby J. C. Reynolds. Reynolds used logical relations to formalize thisconnection inlanguages with type variables and user-defined types. We userelational parametricityto construct a model for an Algol-like language in which interactionsbetween local andnon-local entities satisfy certain relational criteria. Reasoningabout local variables essentiallyinvolves proving properties of polymorphic functions. The new modelsupportsstraightforward validations of all the test equivalences that havebeen proposed in theliteratu...

We first show that the context-freelanguages for whichthe number of words of every length is bounded by a fixed polynomialare exactlythe bounded context-free languages in the sense of Ginsburg [G].Thus, wepresent a length characterization for bounded context-free languages.We thenstudy slender context-free languages, i.e., those containing at mosta constantnumber of words of each length. Recently, Ilie proved that every suchlanguagecan be described by a finite union of terms of the form uviwxiy [I]. We provide acompletely different proof of this, using constructive methods. Thisenables us toprove that thinness and slenderness are decidable.

Title: Features of Architecture Description Languages
Abstract: Introduction1.1 Background: system architecture for system development?The characteristic approach in mature engineering disciplines (e.g.civil and chemical engineering)is to build systems (e.g., buildings or chemical plants) from knownsolutions such asproven designs and existing components [Shaw90,D'Ippolito89]].Engineers in mature disciplinesalso put great emphasis on proactively avoiding costly problems byevaluating the system beforeit is built [Liu87]. Models of the system's architecture areimportant tools for applying known solutionsand doing early evaluation in mature engineering disciplines. Insoftware engineering, thecorollary is modelling the software architecture.By software architecture, we mean the components into which a systemis divided at thelevel of system organization, and the ways in which those componentscommunicate, interact, andcoordinate with each other [Garlan93] [Shaw95].

Title: Self-Alignments in Words and Their Applications
Abstract: Some quantities associated with periodicities in words are analyzedwithin the Bernoulliprobabilistic model. In particular, the following problem isaddressed. Assume that a stringX is given, with symbols emitted randomly but independently accordingto some known distributionof probabilities. Then, for each pair (W , Z) of distinct suffixes ofX, the expectedlength of the longest common prefix of W and Z is sought. Thecollection of these lengths,that are called here self-alignments, plays a crucial role in severalalgorithmic problems onwords, such as building suffix trees or inverted files, detectingsquares and other regularities,computing substring statistics, etc. The asymptotically bestalgorithms for these problemsare quite complex and thus risk to be unpractical. The presentanalysis of self-alignmentsand related measures suggests that, in a variety of cases, morestraightforward algorithmicsolutions may yield comparable or even better performances.Key words and ph...

Our mainresult is that in the case of alphabetic dominoes the splicingsemigroup generated from an initial regular set is again regular.This implies positive solution of two open problems stated by Head,namely the regularity of splicing systems and the decidability oftheir membership problem.

Characteristics of such systemsare a complex knowledgebase and an inference engine which uses this knowledge to solve agiven problem. Languages forkbs have to cover both these aspects. They have to provide a means tospecify a complex and largeamount of knowledge and they have to provide a means to specify thedynamic reasoningbehavior of a kbs. Nevertheless, kbs are just a specific type ofsoftware system. Therefore it seemsquite natural to compare formal languages for specifying kbs withformal languages which weredeveloped by the software engineering community for specifyingsoftware systems. That is thesubject of this paper.IntroductionOver the last few years a number of semiformal, formal, andexecutable specificationlanguages1have been developed for describing knowledge-based systems (kbs).Thesespecification languages can be used to ...

The programmer controls the granularity of parallelismcoordinatingcommunication and synchronization of the agents via a centralizeddata structure. Thecommunication mechanism is inherited from the blackboard model ofproblem solving.Intuitively, the granularity of the logic processes to be elaboratedin parallel is large,while the resources shared on the blackboard can be veryfine-grained.An operational semantics for Shared Prolog is given in terms of adistributed model.Through an abstract notion of computation, the kinds of parallelismsupported by thelanguage as well as properties of infinite computations, such aslocal deadlocks, arestudied.The expressiveness of the language is shown with respect to thespecification of twoclasses of applications: metaprogramming and blackboard systems.Categories an...

The aim of thispaper is to identify and characterise what we currently know and tomove towards the longer term goal of developing a comprehensiveunified methodology. We first identify dimensions for characterisingontologies, to be used as a basis for noting which techniques andguidelines for building ontologies apply in different circumstances.We then give an overview of the current state of the art, noting thatmost work addresses just a small part of the life cycle. The very fewmore complete methods are limited to case studies involving singleontologies and they are hard to compare. In the main part of thispaper, we examine two such methods and give a framework for comparingand unifying them. We emphasise that different approaches arerequired for difference circumstances, and give some guidelines forwhen to use which techniques. We conclude by ...

Abstract: In this paper, we further elaborate global control for partialdeduction:For which atoms, among possibly infinitely many, shouldpartial deductions be produced, meanwhile guaranteeing correctnessas well as termination, and providing ample opportunities forfinegrainedpolyvariance?Our solution is based on two ingredients. First, we use the wellknownconcept of a characteristic tree to guide abstraction (orgeneralisation)and polyvariance, and aim for producing one specialisedprocedure per characteristic tree generated. Previous work alongthis line failed to provide abstraction correctly dealing withcharacteristictrees. We show how this can be rectified in an elegant way.Secondly, we structure combinations of atoms and associatedcharacteristictrees in global trees registering "causal" relationshipsamongsuch pairs. This will allow us to spot looming non-termination andconsequently perform proper generalisation in order to avert thedanger,without having to i...

Language is expressedby words, i.e. strings of symbols, which are generated by agents withtheir own symbolicgrammar system. Agents communicate with each other by deriving andaccepting words in termsof their own grammar. They are ranked according to theircommunicative effectiveness: an agentwhich can derive less frequent and less acceptable words and acceptwords in less computationaltime will have higher scores. They can evolve by mutationalprocesses, which change rewriting rulesin their symbolic grammars. Complexity and diversity of wordsincrease in the course of time. Theemergence of modules and loop structure enhances the evolution.

It turns out thatrepresentabilityproblems are major obstacles for case-based learnability. Restrictingtheattention to so-called proper patterns avoids these representabilityproblems.A couple of learnability results for proper pattern languages arederived bothfor case-based learning from only positive data and for case-basedlearning frompositive and negative data. Under the so-called competing semantics,we showthat the learnability result for positive and negative data can belifted to thegeneral case of arbitrary patterns.

Inthis new setting, both the signature and verification exponents ofRSA are kept secret by the signer, while the public key consists of acomposite modulus and a sample RSA signature on a single publicmessage. Our scheme possesses several attractive properties. First ofall, provable security, as forging the undeniable signatures is ashard as forging regular RSA signatures.

A suite of methods is proposed thatvary in the complexity and volume of the control informationtransmitted and subsequently differ in response times,degrees of concurrency, and space and processing overheads.The proposed methods are combined with cachingto improve query latency. The relative advantages of eachmethod are demonstrated through both simulation resultsand qualitative arguments.

Hence, it is beneficial to model major parts ofEC applications also as workflows.

Abstract: A general method is described for formally specifying and reasoningabout distributed systems with any desired degree of immediacy forrevoking authentication. To effect revocation, `authenticatingentities' impose freshness constraints on credentials orauthenticated statements made by trusted intermediaries. If freshstatements are not presented, then the authentication isquestionable. Freshness constraints are derived from initial policyassumptions and authentic statements made by trusted intermediaries.By adjusting freshness constraints, the delay for certain revocationcan be arbitrarily bounded. We illustrate how the inclusion offreshness policies within certificates enables the design of a secureand highly available revocation service. We illustrate theapplication of the method and new techniques in an example.

Abstract: We consider the problem of how to design large decentralizedmulti-agent systems (MAS's) in an automated fashion, withlittle or no hand-tuning. Our approach has each agent runa reinforcement learning algorithm. This converts the probleminto one of how to automatically set/update the rewardfunctions for each of the agents so that the global goal isachieved. In particular we don not want the agents to "workat cross-purposes" as far as the global goal is concerned. Weuse the term artificial COllective INtelligence (COIN) to referto systems that embody solutions to this problem. In thispaper we present a summary of a mathematical frameworkfor COINs. We then investigate the real-world applicabilityof the core concepts of that framework via two computer experiments:we show that our COINs perform near optimallyin a difficult variant of Arthur's bar problem [1] (and in particularavoid the tragedy of the commons for that problem),and we also illustrate optimal performance for our...

Title: A Unified Notion of Outliers: Properties and Computation
Abstract: As said in signal processing, "One person's noiseis another person's signal." For many applications,such as the exploration of satellite or medicalimages, and the monitoring of criminal activitiesin electronic commerce, identifying exceptionscan often lead to the discovery of trulyunexpected knowledge. In this paper, we studyan intuitive notion of outliers. A key contributionof this paper is to show how the proposednotion of outliers unifies or generalizes many existingnotions of outliers provided by discordancytests for standard statistical distributions. Thus,a unified outlier detection system can replace awhole spectrum of statistical discordancy testswith a single module detecting only the kinds ofoutliers proposed. A second contribution of thispaper is the development of an approach to findall outliers in a dataset. The structure underlyingthis approach resembles a data cube, whichhas the advantage of facilitating integration withthe many OLAP and data mining s...

Title: Benefits of Learning in Negotiation
Abstract: Negotiation has been extensively discussed in gametheoretic,economic, and management science literatures for decades. Recentgrowing interest in electronic commerce has given increasedimportance to automated negotiation. Evidence both from theoreticalanalysis and from observations of human interactions suggests that ifdecision makers can somehow take into consideration what other agentsare thinking and furthermore learn during their interactions howother agents behave, their payoff might increase. In this paper, wepropose a sequential decision making model of negotiation, calledBazaar. Within the proposed negotiation framework, we model learningas a Bayesian belief update process. In this paper, we explore thehypothesis that learning is beneficial in sequential negotiation andpresent initial experimental results.

Title: A Machine Learning Approach to Automated Negotiation and Prospects for    Electronic Commerce
Abstract: We show how a system of artificial adaptive agents, using a geneticalgorithm based learning technique, can learn strategies that enableit to effectively participate in stylized business negotiations. Thenegotiation policies learned are evaluated on several dimensions,including joint outcomes, nearness to the efficient frontier, and thesimilarity to outcomes of human negotiations. The results arepromising for integrating such agents into practicable electroniccommerce systems. We discuss what a system might look like and waysin which particular classes of business negotiations could besupported or even entirely automated. 1 Introduction Even in simplenegotiations, people often reach sub-optimal negotiations thereby"leaving money on the table" [1] [2]. While many factorscontribute to missing out on gains from trade---overconfidence,falsely assuming fixed pies, and the framing of the situation (e.g.[3])---the end result is that parties fail to find agreements whichwould ma...

Title: A Logic-based Knowledge Representation for Authorization with Delegation
Abstract: : We introduce Delegation Logic (DL), a logic-based knowledgerepresentation(i.e., language) that deals with authorization in large-scale, open,distributed systems. Ofcentral importance in any system for deciding whether requests shouldbe authorized in sucha system are delegation of authority, negation of authority, andconflicts between authorities.DL's approach to these issues and to the interplay among them borrowsfrom previous workon delegation and trust management in the computer-securityliterature and previous workon negation and conflict handling in the logic-programming andnon-monotonic reasoningliterature, but it departs from previous work in some crucial ways.In this introductorypaper, we present the syntax and semantics of DL and explain ournovel design choices.This first paper focuses on delegation, including explicit treatmentof delegation depth anddelegation to complex principals; a forthcoming companion paperfocuses on negation.Compared to previous lo...

Abstract: Due to the popularity of the XML data format, several querylanguagesfor XML have been proposed,specially devised to handle data whose structure is unknown, loose,or absent. While these languages arerich enough to allow for querying the content and structure of an XMLdocument, a varying or unknownstructure can make formulating queries a very difficult task.

Title: AAMAS Workshop on Multi-Agent Systems for Medicine, Computational Biology, and Bioinformatics Preface
Abstract: There is nearly no country in the world not suffering from the ever increasing impacts and costs for its health care system. These are not the least boosted by the steadily increasing number of drugs, diagnosis tools and methods, and treatment procedures that appear continuously on the market. On the other hand, in todays globalized world, a fast and reliable system of medical prevention, diagnosis and treatment is of eminent importance, as can be seen from, for example, the recent problems with SARS and the bird flu. Such highly contagious and lethal diseases can threaten the globe if they were not fought immediately with the highest level of efficiency and reliability. This requires, first of all, a fast and reliable (early) diagnosis, no matter where the affected person may geographically be in the world. The above are some of the many situations that manifest that the medical domain is characterized by requirements for high dynamics, distribution, flexibility, scalability, extensibility, efficiency, cooperative work and collaboration, proactivity,

Title: An Implemented Prototype of Bluetooth-Based Multi-Agent System
Abstract:  People tend to form social networks within specific geographical areas. This is motivated by the fact that the geographical locality corresponds generally to common interests and opportunities offered by the people active in the area (e.g. students of a university could be interested to buy or sell textbooks adopted for a specific course, to share notes, or just to meet together to play basketball). Cellular phones and more in general mobile devices are currently widely used and represent a big opportunity to support social communities. We present an application of multi-agent systems accessible via mobile devices (cellular phones and PDAs), where Bluetooth technology has been adopted to reflect users locality. We illustrate an implemented prototype of the proposed architecture and we discuss the opportunities offered by the system. I.

Title: Tableau machine: an alien presence in the home. CHI06 extended abstracts
Abstract: Research in Ambient Intelligence and Ubiquitous Computing has put computational devices into many social settings while leaving intact much of the task support and information access  model from traditional HCI. Recently, researchers have proposed novel approaches that support systems designed for engagement, enjoyment, enchantment, and wonder. Since the objectives for these systems differ, the design approach, development decisions, and evaluation questions shift in turn. Tableau Machine is an instance of an ambient intelligence and ubiquitous computing system designed for extended experience. It is an example of an Alien Presence, in that viewers interact with the system both as an autonomous agent, ascribing some intentionality to it, and as an alien reflection, a strange mirror of social life. We present Tableau Machine, a non-human social actor for the home that intends to open a space for contemplation and conversation among members of a home environment.

Title: Reduced Human Fatigue in Interactive Evolutionary Computation for Micromachine Design
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method of using Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC) for the design of Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS). A key limitation of IEC is human fatigue. Based on the results of a study of a previous IEC MEMS tool, an alternate form that requires less human interaction is presented. The method is applied on top of a conventional multi-objective genetic algorithm, with the human in a supervisory role, providing evaluation only every n th-generation. Human interaction is applied to the evolution process by means of Pareto-rank shifting, which is used for the fitness calculation used in selection. Results of a test of 13 users shows that this IEC method can produce statistically significant better MEMS resonators than non-interactive evolutionary synthesis. Keywords:

Title: The applicability of recurrent neural networks for biological sequence analysis
Abstract: Selection of machine learning techniques requires a certain sensitivity to the re-quirements of the problem. In particular the problem can be made more tractable by deliberately using algorithms that are biased towards solutions of the requisite kind. In this paper we argue that recurrent neural networks have a natural bias towards a problem domain of which biological sequence analysis tasks are a subset. We use experiments with synthetic data to illustrate this bias. We then demonstrate that this bias can be exploitable using a dataset of protein sequences containing several classes of subcellular localisation targeting peptides. The results show that com-1 pared with feed forward, recurrent neural networks will generally perform better on sequence analysis tasks. Furthermore, as the patterns within the sequence become more ambiguous, the choice of specific recurrent architecture becomes more critical.

Title: Evolutionary Design of Neural Networks for Classification and Regression
Abstract: The Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) are the most popular class of Neural Networks. When applying MLPs, the search for the ideal architecture is a crucial task, since it should should be complex enough to learn the input/output mapping, without overfitting the training data. Under this context, the use of Evolutionary Computation makes a promising global search approach for model selection. On the other hand, ensembles (combinations of models) have been boosting the performance of several Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. In this work, a novel evolutionary technique for MLP design is presented, being also used an ensemble based approach. A set of real world classification and regression tasks was used to test this strategy, comparing it with a heuristic model selection, as well as with other ML algorithms. The results favour the evolutionary MLP ensemble method.

Title: PCP: Efficient endpoint congestion control
Abstract: In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel endpoint congestion control system that achieves near-optimal performance in all likely circumstances. Our approach, called the Probe Control Protocol (PCP), emulates network-based control by using explicit short probes to test and temporarily acquire available bandwidth. Like TCP, PCP requires no network support beyond plain FIFO queues. Our initial experiments show that PCP, unlike TCP, achieves rapid startup, small queues, and low loss rates, and that the efficiency of our approach does not compromise eventual fairness and stability. Further, PCP is compatible with sharing links with legacy TCP hosts, making it feasible to deploy. 1

Title: A new way of estimating compute boundedness and its application to dynamic voltage scaling
Abstract: : Many recent dynamic voltage-scaling (DVS) algorithms use hardware events (such as cache misses, memory bus transactions, or instruction execution rates) as the basis for deciding how much a program region can be slowed down with acceptable performance loss. Although these approaches result in power savings, the hardware events measured are at best indirectly related to execution time and clock frequency. We propose a new metric for evaluating the performance loss caused by DVS, a metric that is logically related to clock frequency and execution time, namely the percentage drop in cycles. Further, we show that we can predict with high accuracy the execution time of a code region at any clock frequency after measuring the total number of cycles spent in that region for two clock frequenciesthe maximum and the second highest clock frequency. Measurements using several real-world applications show that this two-point  model predicts execution times with an accuracy that is greater than 95 % in many cases. This result can be used to develop low-overhead DVS algorithms that are more system-aware than many of the current algorithms, which

Title: Thermal Modeling and Management of DRAM Memory Systems
Abstract: With increasing speed and power density, high-performance memories, including FB-DIMM (Fully Buffered DIMM) and DDR2 DRAM, now begin to require dynamic thermal management (DTM) as processors and hard drives did. The DTM of memories, nevertheless, is different in that it should take the processor performance and power consumption into consideration. Existing schemes have ignored that. In this study, we investigate a new approach that controls the memory thermal issues from the source generating memory activities  the processor. It will smooth the program execution when compared with shutting down memory abruptly, and therefore improve the overall system performance and power efficiency. For multicore systems, we propose two schemes called adaptive core gating and coordinated DVFS. The first scheme activates clock gating on selected processor cores and the second one scales down the frequency and voltage levels of processor cores when the memory is to be overheated. They can successfully control the memory activities and handle thermal emergency. More importantly, they improve performance significantly under the given thermal envelope. Our simulation results show that adaptive core gating improves performance by up to 23.3 % (16.3 % on average) on a four-core system with FB-DIMM when compared with DRAM thermal shutdown; and coordinated DVFS with control-theoretic methods improves the performance by up to 18.5 % (8.3 % on average).

Title: Dynamic Allocation for Scratch-Pad Memory using Compile-Time Decisions
Abstract: In this research we propose a highly predictable, low overhead and yet dynamic, memory allocation strategy for embedded systems with scratch-pad memory. A scratch-pad is a fast compiler-managed SRAM memory that replaces the hardware-managed cache. It is motivated by its better real-time guarantees vs cache and by its significantly lower overheads in energy consumption, area and overall runtime, even with a simple allocation scheme. Scratch-pad allocation primarily methods are of two types. First, software-caching schemes emulate the workings of a hardware cache in software. Instructions are inserted before each load/store to check the softwaremaintained cache tags. Such methods incur large overheads in runtime, code size, energy consumption and SRAM space for tags and deliver poor real-time guarantees just like hardware caches. A second category of algorithms partitions variables at compile-time into the two banks. However, a drawback of such static allocation schemes is that they do not account for dynamic program behavior. It is easy to see why a data allocation that never changes at runtime cannot achieve the full locality benefits of a cache. We propose a dynamic allocation methodology for global and stack data and program code that, (i) accounts for changing program requirements at runtime (ii) has no software-caching tags (iii) requires no run-time checks (iv) has extremely low overheads, and (v) yields 100 % predictable memory access times.

Title: PMaude: Rewrite-based specification language for probabilistic object systems
Abstract: We introduce a rewrite-based specification language for modelling probabilistic concurrent and distributed systems. The language, based on PMaude, has both a rigorous formal basis and the characteristics of a high-level rule-based programming language. Furthermore, we provide tool support for performing discrete-event simulations of models written in PMaude, and for statistically analyzing various quantitative aspects of such models based on the samples that are generated through discrete-event simulation. Because distributed and concurrent communication protocols can be modelled using actors (concurrent objects with asynchronous message passing), we provide an actor PMaude module. The module aids writing specifications in a probabilistic actor formalism. This allows us to easily write specifications that are purely probabilistic  and not just non-deterministic. The absence of such (un-quantified) non-determinism in a probabilistic system is necessary for a form of statistical analysis that we also discuss. Specifically, we introduce a query language called Quantitative Temporal Expressions (or QuaTEx in short), to query various quantitative aspects of a probabilistic model. We also describe a statistical technique to evaluate QuaTEx expressions for a probabilistic model. 1

Title: Abstract Secure E-Commerce Transactions for Multicast Services
Abstract: With the advent of an increasing number of multicast services such as audio/video streaming, news broadcast and software distribution, accounting for the resources consumed by subscribers becomes essential. However, multicast environments are inherently more susceptible to attacks because there is as yet no proper foundation for securing multicast networks. However, any e-commerce operational environment requires support for the security properties such as authentication, authorization, data confidentiality, and non-repudiation. As secured multicast services gain popularity in the Internet, at one point there would be a significant response from the service providers to support e-commerce through multicast networks. In this thesis, a Multicast Security Protection Profile (MSPP) has been presented to identify and secure the operating environment of multicast sessions. Although e-commerce protocols such as SSL, TLS, and SET protocols offer some forms of security in e-transactions, they cannot be directly extended to provide security for e-commerce sessions in the multicast (point-to-multipoint) environment. Therefore, we have designed an architectural framework, called the Secure E-Commerce Transactions for Multicast Services (SETMS), to secure e-commerce sessions for multicast environments. The SETMS framework provides authentication of host through HIP

Title: Towards Intelligent Services: A case study in chemical emergency response
Abstract: In a short period the Web has become an important part of our lives. However, the full potential of the web is still not realized. Two recent developmentsweb services and the semantic webare steps in the direction of utilizing the full potential of the Web. Web services allow applications to utilize the web for automatically extracting (and updating) information while the semantic web enterprise promises to provide the infrastructure that allows intelligent web services to be rapidly created and deployed. However, with this comes the task of transforming the traditional web-based systems to web-services over the semantic web. In this paper, we demonstrate how an existing successful web-based system for providing help to first responders of chemically hazardous emergencies (called E-plan) can be converted into a web-services based model using the semantic web and intelligent reasoning technologies. Our efforts can be regarded as a case study in converting monolithic web-based applications to a more agile, rapidly deployable intelligent web-services model. 1

Title: SPECIFYING AND REASONING IN THE CALCULUS OF OBJECTS
Abstract: Since type theory merges constructive logic with functional programming language it appears a very promising system for formal program construction. The present thesis deals with this idea in the environment of a type theoretic system equipped with the type constructor representing a simple form of objects. The presented interpretation of an object type requires rather non-trivial extension of the underlaying calculus of the type theory. The notion of box, which is the content containment structure with a marker variable, is added to the syntax of the calculus that allows to delimit internal states of objects in the definitions of methods. The acquired overall simple notation is a justification of the need for this extraordinary extension. The objectives of this thesis are mainly to give the formal representation of simple object model and to show its significant metatheoretical properties. We also show the capabilities of the system for specifying and reasoning about programs by defining the basic concepts of program specifications and several stewise refinement operations and techniques for reasoning about the correctness of programs. To do this the Core Calculus of Objects (CCO) is introduced. CCO is derived from
