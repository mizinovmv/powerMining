methyl ester, a novel oleanolic acid saponin derivative from achyranthes;fauriei roots, induces apoptosis in human breast cancer mcf-7 and mda-mb-453 cells via a caspase activation pathway </title><content>achyranthoside;h methyl ester (ah-me) is an oleanolic acid saponin derivative isolated from the roots of achyranthes;fauriei through diazomethane treatment. ah-me exhibited significant cytotoxicity against human breast cancer mcf-7 and mda-mb-453 cells, with respective id50 values of 4.0 and 6.5;&amp;#956;m in the mtt assay. ah-me is a unique saponin containing three methoxycarbonyl groups in the sugar moiety linked to the c-3 position of oleanolic acid. the demethylation of these methoxycarbonyl groups by alkaline hydrolysis caused a marked reduction of the cytotoxicity of ah-me, suggesting that the methoxycarbonyl groups of ah-me are key groups for the acquisition of cytotoxicity against human cancer cells. the staining of cancer cells with 4&amp;#8242;,6&amp;#8242;-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi) showed that the population of cells with altered nuclear morphology, for example chromatin condensation and fragmentation, increased markedly after ah-me treatment. exposure of mcf-7 and mda-mb-453 cells to ah-me resulted in a dose-dependent and time-dependent increase in the sub-g1 population, and in the cleavage of poly-adp-ribose polymerase (parp) followed by the formation of an 89 kd peptide. pretreatment of the cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-vad-fmk abolished the cleavage of parp by ah-me treatment and suppressed the antiproliferative effect of ah-me on tumor cell growth. these results together led to the suggestion that ah-me induces apoptosis via the caspase activation pathway in human breast cancer cells, and apoptosis is the major mode of the cytotoxic effect triggered by ah-me. </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Chun-Ching Shih  | Cheng-Hsiu Lin  | Wei-Li Lin

(vlpr)] after dinitrofluorobenzene challenge in mice. naringin, a major flavanone glycoside component of ch-ext, showed a potent dose-dependent inhibition against ipr, lpr and vlpr. neohesperidin, another major glycoside component of ch-ext, showed an inhibition against vlpr. the effect of ch-ext on type iv allergic reaction was examined by determining inhibitory activity against ear swelling in mice by using the picryl chloride-induced contact dermatitis (pc-cd) model. oral administration (p.o.) of ch-ext and subcutaneous administration (s.c.) of prednisolone inhibited ear swelling during the induction phase of pc-cd. the inhibitory activities of combinations of ch-ext (p.o.) and prednisolone (s.c.) against pc-cd in mice were more potent than those of ch-ext alone and prednisolone alone, without enhancing the adverse effects. other combinations of prednisolone (s.c.) and flavanone glycoside (p.o.) components of ch-ext, i.e. naringin and neohesperidin, exerted similar

procera latex has long been used in traditional medicines. extracts from c. procera latex have been reported to have various pharmacological actions, including protection from myocardial infarction, hepatoprotective action, antitumor activity, antinociceptive, and pro- and anti-inflammatory actions. to evaluate the immunomodulatory functions of the water-soluble c. procera extract (cpe), we investigated its ability to activate macrophages&amp;#8212;effector cells in inflammatory and immune responses. intraperitoneal injection of cpe in mice (2;mg/mouse) induced migration of macrophages to the intraperitoneal cavity, confirming the proinflammatory effects of water-soluble cpe. the direct effects of cpe on macrophages were then assessed by measuring the production of nitric oxide (no) as an indicator for macrophage activation. addition of cpe (1&amp;#8211;10;&amp;#956;g/ml) to the culture medium of the murine monocyte/macrophage cell line raw264.7 caused an increase in no production in a time- and dose-dependent manner. cpe-elicited no production was blocked by application of an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos). expression of inos mrna was induced by treatment of cultured macrophages with cpe. injection of cpe in mice also resulted in an increase in plasma no level. the results suggest that cpe activates macrophages and facilitates no production via up-regulation of inos gene expression. </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Koichi Machida | Erika Matsuoka  | Masao Kikuchi  </authors><title>five new glycosides from

acute nephritis. it is presumed that l. camtschatcense has an inhibitory effect against nephritis caused by reactive oxygen species (ros) owing to its antioxidant activities. consequently, the antioxidant effect of l. camtschatcense extracts was assessed against fe2+/ascorbic acid (asa)-induced lipid peroxidation in rat kidney and brain homogenates. the antioxidant effect of the chloroform extract (ce) was more potent than that of the methanol extract (me) for both homogenates. the antioxidant effect of both extracts was similar to those of &amp;#945;-tocopherol, a lipid-soluble antioxidant, and glutathione (gsh), a water-soluble antioxidant, which were used as reference compounds. although ce showed a low radical-scavenging effect for superoxide anion radicals (o2в·&amp;#8722;) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) radicals, assessed by using an electron spin resonance (esr) method, hydroxyl radicals (в·oh) were markedly scavenged by more than 80%. on the other hand, me showed more significant scavenging effect for dpph radicals and o2в·&amp;#8722; than ce. these results suggest that the inhibitory effects of the l. camtschatcense extract on lipid peroxidation in rat kidney and brain are based on its high radical-scavenging effect against в·oh, o2в·&amp;#8722;, and lipid-derived radicals generated from the cell membrane.

using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (lc/ms/ms). gf was converted to ganodermatriol by anaerobic incubation with bacterial mixtures from rats and humans. this metabolite was detected in rat feces, but not in plasma and urine, after oral administration of gf. the fate of gf after oral (p.o.) and intravenous (i.v.) administration to rats was examined in pharmacokinetics studies. plasma samples pretreated by solid-phase extraction were quantified by hplc/ms/ms over a gf concentration range of 1.25&amp;#8211;100;ng/ml (s/n;=;5). the intra- and interday precision (cv%) was below 8% and accuracy was within the range of 95.9&amp;#8211;103.6% for all samples. the range of recovery ratios was 89.2&amp;#8211;98.2%. after the administration of gf at 0.5;mg/kg i.v., the plasma concentrations of gf quickly declined and the elimination half-life values (t 1/2&amp;#945; and t 1/2&amp;#946;) were about 2.4 and 34.8;min. on the other hand, the elimination half-life values (t 1/2&amp;#945;) after p.o. administration of gf at doses of 20 and 50;mg/kg were 14.4 and 143.3;min for the former, and 18.6 and 114.6;min for the latter. the auc0&amp;#8211;t value was

human intestinal bacterial strains </title><content>the flowers from pueraria, which are called puerariae flos, have been used since ancient times for recovery from alcohol intoxication. we elucidated the microbial transformation of the main isoflavones (1, 1a and 2) by using 29 commercially available human intestinal bacterial strains together with the bioactivation of the hepatoprotective activity of their metabolites. tectoridin (1a), which contains only one glucosyl moiety, was metabolized to its aglycone 1b by various bacterial strains. on the other hand, the metabolism of 1 and 2, which both have disaccharide groups, was limited to specific bacterial strains. the metabolites 1c and 2c obtained from the peptostreptococcus productus strain were completely different from those produced by the other strains. these metabolites were identified as 6-hydroxygenistein and 6-hydroxybiochanin a, respectively. the glycosides 1, 1a and 2 did not show any hepatoprotective activity, whereas aglycones 1b and 2b showed moderate activity. furthermore, the hepatoprotective activity of the demethylated metabolites 1c and 2c was extremely potent. although not all people have p. productus in their gastrointestinal tract, the o-demethylated compounds might become one of the bioactivated metabolites when puerariae flos is administered orally.

upregulating protein c pathway </title><content>sepsis remains the leading cause of death in intensive care units. uncontrolled systemic inflammation and an impaired protein c pathway are two important contributors to sepsis pathophysiology. based on the beneficial effects of the saponin fraction from astragalus membranaceus roots (sam) against inflammation, liver dysfunction, and endothelium injury, we investigated the potential protective roles and underlying mechanisms of sam on polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (clp) in mice. sam, orally administered 1;h before and after clp, significantly elevated the survival rate of mice. at 96;h after clp operation, all mice in the model group died, whereas 33.3% of mice in the sam (400;mg/kg)-treated group survived. sam attenuated both inflammatory factors and their abilities to induce tissue dysfunction, which was mainly evidenced by decreased infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, tissue edema, and lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, lowered levels of myeloperoxidase (mpo), nitric oxide (no), lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), alanine aminotransferase (alt), and aspartate aminotransferase (ast) in serum, as well as downregulated expressions of inos and il-1&amp;#946; mrna in livers. furthermore, we addressed the effects of sam on the protein c (pc) pathway, closely linked with sepsis. in clp-induced septic mice, sam elevated the impaired expression of pc mrna in livers. in vitro, sam reversed the decreased expressions of thrombomodulin (tm) and endothelial pc receptor (epcr) mrna induced by lipopolysaccharide (lps) in endothelial cells. these findings suggest that sam is able to restore the impaired protein c pathway. taken together, the current study demonstrates that sam has protective effects on polymicrobial sepsis in mice. the mechanisms of action involve anti-inflammation and upregulation of the pc pathway.

</title><content>simple and rapid analysis of aristolochic acid (aa) in crude drugs and kampo extracts using a solid-phase extraction method and hplc-pda analysis was investigated. extraction of aa from samples was accomplished by adding methanol containing 1% ammonia. the addition of ammonia ionized the aa of acidic substances so that they adhered to an acrylamide copolymer of a strong anion exchange resin (sep-pak qma) coupled to diol silica easily. furthermore, a mixture of acetonitrile&amp;#8211;water&amp;#8211;phosphoric acid (75:25:2, v/v) was effective in isolating aa from its carrier. since almost all interfering peaks originating from contaminants in crude drugs and kampo extract formulations could be removed, a satisfactory hplc chromatogram of aa was obtained. a good result was also obtained when aristolochiaceae and crude drugs containing aa were tested. particularly in the case of the medicinal parts of asarum, several interfering peaks and a ghost peak detected near the aa peak were eliminated. the aa contents of two kampo extract formulations, tokishigyakukagoshuyushokyoto and ryutanshakanto, were calculated by hplc analysis. the aa content (the sum of aa-i and aa-ii) was 1.25&amp;#8211;6.13;mg per daily dose. from an additional recovery experiment for kampo formulations, high recovery rates of aa were obtained. neither lc/ms nor special instrumentation was necessary. our results suggest that this simple, quick, and sensitive analytical method to detect aa in crude drugs and kampo extract formulations would be valuable in safety inspections of aa in crude drugs and their products. </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Takuro Maruyama | Maiko Kawamura | Ruri Kikura-Hanajiri | Hiromitsu Takayama  | Yukihiro Goda

the commercial kratom products using the internal transcribed spacer (its) sequence analysis of rdna in preparation for future regulation of this product. in addition, a previously reported method to authenticate the plant, utilizing polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) was applied to the same products in order to estimate the method&amp;#8217;s accuracy and utility. the its sequence analysis of the commercial kratoms revealed that most of them were derived from m. speciosa or closely related plants, while the others were made from the same tribe plant as m. speciosa. the reported pcr-rflp method could clearly distinguish kratoms from the other psychoactive plants available in the japanese markets and also from related plants. the authentication method is considered to be useful for the practical regulation of the plant due to its wide range of application, high accuracy and simplicity.

groups each containing 12 rats: control (c); nitrite intoxication (n); ys;+;nitrite intoxication (ny). c and n groups were fed standard rat feed (srf). the ny group was fed srf;+;100;ppm ys powder for 4;weeks. acute nitrite intoxication was induced by subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of sodium nitrite (60;mg/kg) 1;day after the feeding period. fifty minutes after sodium nitrite administration, blood samples and tissues including lung, liver, and kidney were collected for clinical biochemistry and histopathological investigations. ys treatment was found to decrease methemoglobin, blood and tissue malondialdehyde, and tissue nitric oxide concentrations, and to increase the glutathione in blood and various tissues. however, plasma nitric oxide, total antioxidant activity, &amp;#946;-carotene, and vitamin a did not differ between n and ny groups. while the n group rats showed distinct pathology in various tissues (compared with controls), the ny group had similar lung and liver pathology to the control. only moderate or mild hemorrhage and hyperemia were seen in kidneys of ny group rats. consequently, the natural compounds found in ys, such as polyphenols, steroidal saponins, and other phytonutrients, could be used to substantially protect the organism from nitrite-induced oxidative damage and its complications.

method of conserving characterized populations and elite clones through vegetative propagation and genetic diversity through seeds in podophyllum hexandrum (family berberidaceae). seed dormancy has been considered to be a major constraint in these seeds and most of the earlier reports recommended dormancy-breaking pretreatments such as chilling, gibberellic acid (ga3), etc. however, seeds of the 14 accessions that we tested exhibited no dormancy and hence did not require any pretreatments. besides accession, collection of seeds with high moisture content could be one of the reasons for lack of dormancy. thus, we propose germination of seeds (while they still retained moisture) in sand at 25в°c for high and reproducible results within a shorter period of time compared with earlier reports. hypocotyl dormancy is known to considerably delay plant establishment and hence en masse propagation by preventing the emergence of functional leaves for up to 11&amp;#8211;12;months. manual removal of cotyledonary leaves, being labor and time intensive, is not a feasible method for large-scale seedling establishment. however, in this study, we showed that ga3 at 200;ppm can alleviate hypocotyl dormancy besides reducing the time taken for true or functional leaf emergence. treatment of cotyledonary leaves of 1 week-old-seedlings with 200;ppm ga3 resulted in true or functional leaf emergence within 7;days, and the resultant plants were also more vigorous than the ones obtained from manual removal of cotyledonary leaves. the study helped advance the establishment of seedlings by one growing season (almost 1 year). </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Shinzo Hosoi  | Eri Shimizu | Kazuhiko Arimori | Manabu Okumura | Muneaki Hidaka | Mitsuko Yamada  | Akiyo

rheumatism. several cestrum species are said to be the origin of hierba santa. three lots of hierba santa: cestrum;auriculatum (herb 1 and herb 2) and c.;hediundinum (herb 3), which were purchased from peruvian markets at cuzco (andes area) and equitos (amazon area), respectively, were examined for their pharmacological activities and active components. herbs 1&amp;#8211;3 showed anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities in the in;vivo writhing inhibition test in mouse and inhibited prostaglandin e1-, e2-, or ach-induced contractions of guinea pig ileum in the magnus method. activity-based separation of each extract yielded cestrumines a and b, cestrusides a and b, a mixture of (+)- and (&amp;#8722;)-pinoresinol glucosides, nicotiflorin, rutin, sinapoyl glucose, ursolic acid, &amp;#946;-sitosteryl glucoside, and 2-sec-butyl-4,6-dihydroxyphenyl-&amp;#946;-d-glucopyranoside. among them, cestrumine a and cestrusides a and b are new compounds. all three lots of hierba

induced castor oil diarrhoea, gastric emptying of phenol red meal, gastrointestinal transit of charcoal meal and in vitro mast cell degranulation activity. c. tamala extract (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg, orally) produced a dose-dependent reduction in the total amount of faecal matter in castor oil-induced diarrhoea. the mean distance travelled by charcoal meal at 50 and 100 mg/kg of extract showed a significant reduction in the secretion of gastrointestinal fluid accumulation by 32.5&amp;#8211;65.0%. the na+ and k+ concentrations on castor oil-induced fluid accumulation showed a greater inhibitory effect on na+ levels than on k+ concentrations. c. tamala significantly reduced the lipid peroxidation (p &amp;lt; 0.001) and increased the catalase (p &amp;lt; 0.01) activity in comparison to the castor oil-induced groups. c. tamala leaf extract did not show any significant effect at a higher dose (15 mg/ml) on mast cell degranulation. however, the extract in the dose of 5 and 10 mg/ml conferred significant mast cell protective action (p &amp;lt; 0.001). the percentage of eugenol in extract is 3.8% w/w, and total tannin is 247.5 mg/g. the result indicates the indian spice c. tamala

previously reported that chalcone derivatives isolated from angelica keisekei roots have antitumor and antimetastatic activities. in the present study, we examined the effects of a chromone glucoside cnidimoside a isolated from cnidium japonicum whole plants on tumor growth and tumor metastasis in colon 26-bearing mice. cnidimoside a (50;mg/kg, twice daily) significantly inhibited tumor growth and final tumor weight compared to the growth in vehicle-treated colon 26-bearing mice (control). furthermore, the number of mice with abdominal invasion of tumors was also reduced by orally administered cnidimoside a (50;mg/kg, twice daily). in this study, the cd8+ t cell- and interferon (ifn)-&amp;#947;-positive cell numbers in the small intestine in the colon 26-bearing mice were significantly reduced compared with those in the normal mice, but the natural killer (nk)-positive cell number did not differ significantly between the normal and colon 26-bearing mice. the cd8+ t-, nk and ifn-&amp;#947;-positive cell numbers in the small intestine were significantly increased by orally administered cnidimoside a (50;mg/kg, twice daily) compared to those in vehicle-treated colon

conducted to elucidate the immunomodulatory effect of spirulina fusiformis (a cyanobacterium of the family oscillatoriaceae) in vivo and in vitro. the in vivo effect of s. fusiformis (400 or 800;mg/kg body wt.) on humoral immune response, cell-mediated immune response and tumour necrosis factor alpha was investigated in mice. we also evaluated the effect of s. fusiformis (50 or 100;&amp;#956;g/ml) in vitro on mitogen (phytohaemagglutinin)-induced t lymphocyte proliferation in heparinized human peripheral blood. for comparison, dexamethasone was used as a standard. in mice, s. fusiformis (400 or 800;mg/kg body wt.) administration significantly inhibited the humoral immune response, cell-mediated immune response (delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (dth)) and tumour necrosis factor alpha in a dose-dependent manner. in vitro, s. fusiformis (50 or 100;&amp;#956;g/ml) decreased the mitogen (phytohaemagglutinin)-induced t lymphocyte proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner when compared with control cells. these observations clearly suggest that s. fusiformis has a remarkable immunosuppressive effect, which provides a scientific validation for the popular use of this drug, and helped us in further work on investigating its complete mechanism of action. </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>A  Tanna | R  Nair  | S  Ch|a  </authors><title>assessment of

extracts of polyalthia longifolia var. pendula (annonaceae) leaf for anti-inflammatory activity and to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective potency of the potent solvent extract. successive extraction was performed with six different solvents, viz. petroleum ether, hexane, toluene, chloroform, acetone and methanol. toluene, chloroform, acetone and methanol were used in acute inflammatory studies; the results revealed methanol as most potent extract. hence three concentrations of methanolic extract (300, 600, 900;mg/kg) were used to evaluate its potential as an anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective agent. diclofenac sodium was used as the toxicant in hepatoprotective studies, in which various serum biochemical parameters and liver glycogen were assessed. the three concentrations of methanol showed anti-inflammatory activity comparable to that of the control (diclofenac sodium). all the serum biochemical parameters studied revealed the hepatoprotective nature of the methanol extract, but a concentration effect was not observed. the results indicated that the methanolic extract of polyalthia longifolia var. pendula leaf possesses significant anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective activity. however, the appropriate effective concentration needs to be determined. </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Lars P  Christensen

these flavonoids were found in the root of s. baicalensis; its aerial parts, however, did not contain them. on the other hand, the amounts of those flavonoids in the aerial parts of s. lateriflora

esr single-line spectrum near g;=;2.005 was observed in the sample before irradiation. after irradiation, the intensity of the signal near g;=;2.005 increased. in addition, two subsignals derived from cellulose radicals were observed approximately 3;mt to either side of the main signal, at g;=;2.023 and g;=;1.987. the intensity of the subsignal at g;=;2.023 was proportional to the absorbed dose of radiation. the decrease in intensity of the signals was considerable 2;weeks after irradiation, and continued to decrease steadily thereafter. among the signals, the fading of the subsignal at g;=;2.023 was relatively small. the intensity of the subsignal at g;=;2.023 was detectable for over 1;year in the sample that had been irradiated to the level of disinfection and sterilization. therefore, organic free radicals in irradiated foeniculi fructus can be measured rapidly and with high sensitivity by esr spectroscopy. the stable signal at g;=;2.023 is a promising indicator of the detection of irradiated herbal drugs. </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Maho Sumiyoshi | Teruaki Hayashi  | Yoshiyuki Kimura  </authors><title>effects of the nonsugar fraction of brown sugar on chronic ultraviolet;b irradiation-induced photoaging in melanin-possessing hairless mice </title><content>brown sugar has been used traditionally for the treatment of skin trouble as a component of soaps or lotions. symptoms of aging including wrinkles and pigmentation develop earlier in sun-exposed skin than unexposed skin, a phenomenon referred to as photoaging. ultraviolet;b (uvb) radiation is one of the most important environmental factors influencing photoaging. the aim of this study was to clarify whether the nonsugar fraction of brown sugar prevents chronic uvb-induced aging of the skin using melanin-possessing hairless mice. the nonsugar fraction (1% or 3% solution, 50;&amp;#956;l/mouse) was applied topically to the dorsal region every day for 19;weeks. both solutions prevented an increase in skin thickness and reduction in skin elasticity caused by the uvb. the 3% solution also prevented wrinkles and melanin pigmentation as well as increases in the diameter and length of skin blood vessels. increases in the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (mmp-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) in uvb-irradiated skin was inhibited by the nonsugar fraction. prevention of uvb-induced aging of the skin by topical application of the nonsugar fraction of brown sugar may be due to inhibition of increases in mmp-2 and vegf expression.

antiurolithiatic and antioxidant properties </title><content>in the indigenous system of medicine in india, the plant sesbania grandiflora is claimed to be useful for various ailments, and one such use is for the treatment of renal calculi. the major purpose of this study is to investigate the potential of s. grandiflora in the treatment of renal calculi. the leaf juice of s. grandiflora was evaluated for median lethal dose, gross behavioral changes, antiurolithiatic and antioxidant activities. the antiurolithiatic activity was evaluated by a calculi-producing diet model, using gentamicin (subcutaneously) and 5% ammonium oxalate in rat feed to induce calcium oxalate-type stones. the parameters monitored in the present study are calcium and oxalate deposition in the kidney, kidney weights, urinary excretion of calcium and oxalate. the in vivo antioxidant parameters lipid peroxidation, glutathione reductase and catalase were monitored. the plant juice was also evaluated for scavenging of nitric oxide and 2-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl free radicals. the leaf juice of s. grandiflora was safe orally and exhibited no gross behavioral changes except for an increase in urination. the leaf juice of s. grandiflora showed significant antiurolithiatic activity against calcium oxalate-type stones and also exhibited antioxidant properties. the results obtained in this study provide evidence for the efficacy of the leaf juice of s. grandiflora as antiurolithiatic agent. </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Rawiwun Kaewamatawong  | Mariko Kitajima

a herbal alternative medicine for the prevention and treatment of various cardiovascular diseases. recently, it was shown that hawthorn extract preparations caused negative chronotropic effects in a cultured neonatal murine cardiomyocyte assay, independent of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. the aim of this study was to further characterize the effect of hawthorn extract to decrease the contraction rate of cultured cardiomyocytes. to test the hypothesis that hawthorn is acting via muscarinic receptors, the effect of hawthorn extract on atrial versus ventricular cardiomyocytes in culture was evaluated. as would be expected for activation of muscarinic receptors, hawthorn extract had a greater effect in atrial cells. atrial and/or ventricular cardiomyocytes were then treated with hawthorn extract in the presence of atropine or himbacine. changes in the contraction rate of cultured cardiomyocytes revealed that both muscarinic antagonists significantly attenuated the negative chronotropic activity of hawthorn extract. using quinuclidinyl benzilate, l-[benzylic-4,4&amp;#8242;-3h] ([3h]-qnb) as a radioligand antagonist, the effect of a partially purified hawthorn extract fraction to inhibit muscarinic receptor binding was quantified. hawthorn extract fraction 3 dose-dependently inhibited [3h]-qnb binding to mouse heart membranes. taken together, these findings suggest that decreased contraction frequency by hawthorn extracts in neonatal murine cardiomyocytes may be mediated via muscarinic receptor activation.

strong in vivo antitumor effect. thus, the tumor growth-inhibitory effect of the polysaccharide is apparently due to host-mediated mechanisms. the histopathological analysis suggests that the liver

isoflavones by human intestinal bacterial strains </title><content>intestinal bacteria play an important role for the metabolism of soy isoflavonoids. when soy foods are consumed, the soy isoflavone glucosides are metabolized into their aglycones and the related isoflavonoids by intestinal bacteria. we designed an in vitro microbial metabolic system using 29 commercially available human intestinal bacterial strains and elucidated the metabolism of soy isoflavone glucosides. the strains were classified into three categories, which were 14 facultative anaerobes, 13 obligate anaerobes, and 2 aerobes. almost all facultative anaerobe strains metabolized soy isoflavone glucosides to their aglycones. the ratio of metabolism from glucoside to aglycone was different in each strain. contrary to the facultative anaerobes, some of the obligate anaerobes did not metabolize soy isoflavone glucosides at all. both the aerobic bacteria hardly metabolized soy isoflavone glucosides. the bacterial growth speed might show good correlation to the metabolizing speed of both glucosides. therefore, the speed of metabolism would be different in each bacterial strain, too.

genetic, and chemical polymorphism of curcuma kwangsiensis </title><content>previously, chinese gajutsu available in japan was identified, from the chloroplast trnk gene sequence, to be the rhizomes of curcuma phaeocaulis and two genotypes of c. kwangsiensis. although we defined the two genotypes, the pl and gl types, on the basis of the nucleotide difference, their external features did not correspond to the two phenotypes described in the literature. in this paper, to investigate the relationship between genotype and phenotype of c. kwangsiensis, a field investigation was carried out in its main cultivation areas of guangxi zhuangzu autonomous region and guangdong province, china, and sequence analysis of the trnk gene and single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) analysis of the nuclear 18s rrna gene were performed on the collected specimens. four genotypes of c. kwangsiensis were recognized from the combined 18s rrna gene&amp;#8211;trnk gene sequences: homozygote-k(gl)wtk type, homozygote-k(pl)ztk type, heterozygote-k(gl)wtk type, and heterozygote-ltk type. among the four genotypes, c. kwangsiensis in a field used for cultivation of gajutsu was of heterozygote-k(gl)wtk type. formation of a heterozygote in the 18s rrna gene might be a result of crossbreeding of c. kwangsiensis with several curcuma species which had cytosine at nucleotide position 234. gc analysis of the rhizomes revealed that c. kwangsiensis was characterized by camphor and &amp;#946;-elemene, and by detecting additional components such as curdione and curcumenol curcuma species involved in the formation of the heterozygote might be speculated upon. </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Shunsuke Ishida | Mamoru Okasaka | Freddy Ramos | Yoshiki Kashiwada | Yoshihisa

meanwhile, results of experiments in the laboratory can be brought back to the field for verification and further investigation. a combination of field and laboratory work has led to effective progress in studies of medicinal plants in the field of pharmacognosy. however, the collection of samples with information through fieldwork is not easy, and it fundamentally requires a great deal of research experience. geographical, ethnical, and political affairs often affect its performance, and to establish a good cooperative relationship with foreign localities is inevitably required. beyond these difficulties, fieldwork can provide a framework for the research project and excellent and unique viewpoints concerning the target. this review article describes studies on perilla, agarwood, and cinnamon, focusing mainly on the results of fieldwork performed in indochina on these species. all three of these medicinal plants contain essential oils, and their composition varieties, biosynthetic pathways, pharmacological activities, or induction mechanisms for production are principally investigated through shuttling between fieldwork and laboratory experiments.

parts of g. uralensis collected in mongolia were quantitatively analyzed and compared with glycyrrhizae radix produced in china. most of the 15 samples from eastern, southern and western parts of mongolia contained 26.95&amp;#8211;58.55;mg/g of glycyrrhizin, exceeding the criterion (25;mg/g) assigned in the japanese pharmacopoeia. the sample collected in tamsagiyn hooly, dornod province, in eastern mongolia was of the highest content 58.55;mg/g. the contents of three flavanone constituents (liquiritin apioside, liquiritin and liquiritigenin) and three chalcones (isoliquiritin apioside, isoliquiritin and isoliquiritigenin) varied significantly according to collection places; the subtotal of the three flavanones ranged from 3.00 to 26.35;mg/g, and the subtotal of the three chalcones ranged from 1.13 to 10.50;mg/g. the content of glycyrrhizin and subtotal contents of flavanones and chalcones in the underground parts of g. uralensis from mongolia were obviously lower than wild samples, but higher than cultivated samples derived from the same species produced in china. glycycoumarin, a species-specific constituent of g. uralensis, was detected in all mongolian samples. its contents in samples from eastern mongolia, sergelen and tamsagiyn hooly of dornod province were very high and were compatible with tohoku-kanzo derived from wild chinese g. uralensis. the present study suggested that mongolian g. uralensis could be a source of glycyrrhizae radix, mostly of japanese pharmacopoeia grade. however, the producing area should be taken into consideration to ensure relatively high quality. in addition, planned use and promotion of cultivation must be advocated to avoid confronting mongolian glycyrrhiza with the same threat as its congener in china. our study sheds some light on selecting cultivation areas and superior strains, which are important tasks to promote cultivation. </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Yitzchak Gutterman   |

</title><content> aloe arborescens plants, originating from the deserts of south africa, are grown in the introduction garden at sede boker in the negev desert of israel. in previous studies, we developed agro-technical methods to raise the content of secondary phenol metabolites (sphms) in the aloe leaves. plants that are subjected to repeated leaf pruning respond by increasing the content of their sphms. the sphms found in aloe arborescens include barbaloin, aloenin and derivatives of aloeresin. such compounds are used for many purposes, including human skin protection from sun and fire burns and high radiation, as products of the pharmaceutics and cosmetics industries, and as food supplements for treating stomach ulcers and diabetes. in the current study, the sphms were separated from pruned leaves of the same a. arborescens plants at the same time by two methods: (1) exudation by squeezing the tissues of the leaves, (2) immersion of the leaves' pruned cut bottom in water and collection of the extract. the exudates and extract were frozen, freeze-dried to a powder and the sphms were then separated by chromatography. the yield of powder from water extraction from pruned leaves was much lower than the yield from the exudates. however, higher percentages of the powder from the water extraction contained sphms (between 80 and 92.7%). the content of powder in leaf exudates from pruned leaves was much higher because the sphms were squeezed out from the cells and tissues. however, the percentages of sphms in this powder were much lower (between 39 and 62%).

specificity, the methoxyl group on c-5 and c-7 and the short alkyl chain (1&amp;#8211;5 carbons) on c-6 may be essential for the potent activities. these compounds also showed inhibitory effects on nitric oxide generation and mrna expression of inflammatory mediators, namely, inos and cox-2. interestingly, the inhibitory effect on mrna expression was specific for inos and was not detected for

to be stronger by the constituents of s. alpinum, c. regalis and c. sp. in addition, phenolic content in these antarctic lichen extracts was in the range of 17&amp;#8211;47;mg/g, supporting the

for k. rotunda, the main ingredient of a popular traditional tonic called &amp;#8220;jamu&amp;#8221; especially for women in indonesia. from our previous study, ethanolic extract of b. pandurata showed strong inhibitory effects on the growth of cancer cells, similar to ethanolic extract of curcuma longa. c. longa and its bioactive compound, curcumin, have shown potential anticancer activity in in vitro and in vivo studies and have undergone clinical trials. panduratin a, a chalcone derivative isolated from b. pandurata, was found to inhibit the growth of mcf-7 human breast cancer and ht-29 human colon adenocarcinoma cells with an ic50 of 3.75 and 6.56;вµg/ml, respectively. panduratin a arrested cancer cells labelled with annexin-v and propidium iodide in the g0/g1 phase and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. in an animal model study, male sprague&amp;#8211;dawley rats were fed with ain diet containing ethanolic extracts prepared from the equivalent of 4% by weight of dried rhizomes of b. pandurata and c. longa. aberrant crypt foci (acfs) were induced by two subcutaneous doses (15;mg/kg body weight) of azoxymethane (aom) 1;week apart. the rats were killed 10;weeks later, and the acfs were assessed in the colon. at the dose given to rats, it appeared that the extracts were not toxic. total acfs were slightly reduced by b. pandurata extract compared to

(sond.) kokwaro (anacardiaceae) stem-bark aqueous extract in mice</title><content> sclerocarya birrea (a.rich.) hochst. subsp. caffra (sond.) kokwaro (family: anacardiaceae) is traditionally used in south african folk medicine for the treatment, management and control of a variety of human ailments, including childhood convulsions and epilepsy. in the present study, we have investigated the anticonvulsant activity of the plant&amp;#8217;s stem-bark aqueous extract (sbe) against pentylenetetrazole (ptz)-, picrotoxin (pct)-, and bicuculline (bcl)-induced seizures in mice. phenobarbital and diazepam were used as reference anticonvulsant drugs for comparison. like the reference anticonvulsant agents used, s. birrea sbe (100&amp;#8211;800;mg/kg p.o.) significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05&amp;#8211;0.001) delayed the onset of, and inhibited, ptz-induced seizures. the plant extract (sbe, 100&amp;#8211;800;mg/kg p.o.) also markedly inhibited pct-induced seizures, but only weakly inhibited bcl-induced seizures. in general, the average onset of convulsion was delayed or inhibited, while the average duration of convulsion was not significantly altered (p&amp;gt;0.05). the plant extract also depressed the central nervous system. in conclusion, the findings of the present experimental animal study indicate that s. birrea sbe possesses anticonvulsant activity, thus lending pharmacological support to the suggested folkloric, ethnomedical uses of the plant extract in the management, control, and treatment of childhood convulsions and epilepsy in some rural communities of south Africa.</content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Kanso Iwaki | Satomi Koya-Miyata  | Keizo Kohno | Shimpei Ushio  | Shigeharu Fukuda </authors><title>antimicrobial

effect on differentiation of mouse 3t3-l1 preadipocyte cells into adipocytes. the boiling water extract of du-zhong tea inhibited lipid accumulation in 3t3-l1. the hplc analysis of the extract identified catechin, protocatechuic acid, pyrogallol, and chlorogenic acid. catechin weakly inhibited lipid accumulation after 3t3-l1 differentiation, while protocatechuic acid and chlorogenic acid showed almost no effect. the activity guided separation of du-zhong tea lead the isolation of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (hmf). hmf inhibited lipid accumulation at a concentration of 100;m, and the amount of lipid in the cells was reduced to the similar level of negative control. this is the first isolation of hmf from du-zhong tea and the first observation of its effect on 3t3-l1 differentiation.</content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Sirima Mahattanadul | Nisaudah Radenahmad | Narubodee Phadoongsombut | Thitima Chuchom | Pharkphoom Panichayupakaranant |

curcuma longa, on experimental reflux esophagitis in rats was investigated in order to validate its potential therapeutic use for gastroesophageal reflux disease. curcumin (20;mg/kg, i.d.), the antioxidative agent dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso) (1;ml/kg, i.p.) or the proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole (1;mg/kg, i.d.) inhibited the formation of acute acid reflux esophagitis by 52.5, 61.5 and 70.9% respectively. curcumin alone was not effective in preventing chronic acid reflux esophagitis, but the combination of curcumin and dmso reduced the mortality rate and the severity of the esophagitis ulcer index to the same extent (56.5%) as did the lansoprazole (53.9%). intraduodenal administration of curcumin also markedly prevented the formation of acute mixed reflux esophagitis, together with reducing the incidence or the severity of neutrophil infiltration, when compared to a control group. in contrast, lansoprazole tended to increase the severity of all histopathological changes, when compared to either the control or the curcumin-treated group. aminoguanidine, a specific inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, had no preventive effect against both types of acute reflux esophagitis models, and increased the mortality in the chronic acid reflux esophagitis model. from these results, it is indicated that curcumin can effectively prevent acute reflux esophagitis formation. although curcumin is less potent than lansoprazole in inhibiting acid reflux esophagitis, it is superior to lansoprazole in inhibiting mixed reflux esophagitis. the antiulcerogenic mechanisms are considered to be closely associated with its antioxidant nature and antiinflammatory property.</content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Shin-ya Saito | Sachie Kamiyama  |

basophilic leukemia (rbl-2h3) cells were incubated for 48;h with mao, mao decreased histamine content in a concentration-dependent manner. however, the ratio of released histamine to total histamine was scarcely affected by mao treatment when rbl-2h3 cells were stimulated by ionomycin. on the other hand, the content of -hexosaminidase, another marker of degranulation, was only slightly decreased by mao. the expression level of the active form (53;kda) of l-histidine decarboxylase, the enzyme which synthesizes histamine, was partially suppressed by mao. furthermore, mao significantly suppressed proliferation of rbl-2h3 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine revealed an increasing effect of mao on camp level in rbl-2h3 cells. since this result suggested that mao may stimulate adenylate cyclase, we evaluated the effect of adenylate cyclase inhibitor sq 22536 on mao-induced decrease in histamine content. as a result, we showed that sq 22536 did not have a reducing effect of mao. from these results it is understood that mao decreased histamine content by inhibiting cell proliferation and expression of histidine decarboxylase. however, these effects are not related to the increase in cAMP.</content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Divya Goel |  | Vijender Singh | Mohammed Ali | Gopal Rao

in folk medicine. our studies focused on these plants, starting with solanum lyratum and s. nigrum, which are used as anti-cancer and anti-herpes agents. extensive investigations in 45 solanum plant species revealed that a considerable amount of glycosides such as spirosolane, solanidane, spirostane and furostane is in these plants, and some of the isolated glycosides showed strong anti-proliferative activity against various cancer cell lines and anti-herpes activity. furthermore, we have discovered a few new hypothetical biosynthetic routes in which the pathways for the biosynthesis of 16-acyl-pregnane and pregnane glycosides were the most interesting. the occurrence of these pregnane compounds indicates that they might be internally biosynthesized in the plant from furostanol glycosides by a reaction that is similar to marker degradation. furthermore, this may imply that the administration of steroidal glycosides may result in their metabolization into pregnane derivatives possessing various activities. in order to perform metabolic experiments using the steroidal glycosides, we recently isolated tomato glycosides from ripe tomato fruits for the first time. for this experiment, we examined the metabolites in urine obtained from persons that consumed tomatoes. we obtained androstane derivatives that were probably metabolized via pregnane derivatives from tomato glycoside. hence, when a steroidal glycoside is administered, it may be metabolized into a type of steroidal hormone with various physiological

are dammarane saponins, 35 of which can be classified as belonging to the protopanaxadiols group, and 21 as belonging to the protopanaxatriols group. evidence from phytochemical studies on notoginseng demonstrated that no oleanane-type saponin, which exists in asian ginseng (panax ginseng) and american ginseng (panax quinquefolius), was found. other types of compounds such as non-protein amino acids, polyacetylenes, phytosterols, flavonoids, and polysaccharides, many of which have pharmacological activities, were also isolated from notoginseng. analytical studies on notoginseng were carried out based on botanical and phytochemical advances. in the qualitative studies, identification of the herbal materials and extracts was the main objective. the utilization of high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) fingerprint and molecular biological methods made the identification accurate and efficient. spectral, chromatographic and immunoassay methods were used for the quantitative analysis. hplc methods are the main authority regarding the determination of saponins and other types of constituents. the chromatographic conditions and detectors employed in the hplc are discussed.</content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Euis H  Hakim  | Sjamsul A  Achmad | Lia D  Juliawaty | Lukman Makmur | Yana M  Syah | Norio Aimi | Mariko Kitajima | Hiromitsu

(moraceae) have been investigated in our laboratories during the last decade. over 60 phenolic constituents have been discovered and characterized, including 27 new compounds from 13 indonesian taxa of artocarpus, namely a. champeden, a. lanceifolius, a. teysmanii, a. scortechinii, a. rotunda, a. maingayi, a. kemando, a. bracteata, a. altilis, a. fretessi, a. gomezianus, a. reticulatus and a. glaucus. the principal and the most pronounced features of these phenolic constituents are the assembly of an isoprenyl substituent at c-3 of a flavone skeleton by closure of an ether bridge or a carbon&amp;#x2013;carbon linkage with the b ring of the skeleton, which may further rearrange into xanthone to produce various classes of natural products. the structures of the new and unusual natural products are presented. many of the metabolites also exhibit cytotoxic effect against murine leukemia p388 cells.</content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Sirima Mahattanadul |

of gastric inflammatory diseases in rats</title><content>preventive and curative effects of curcumin on experimental acute and chronic gastric ulcers were investigated to validate its clinical application on a remedy for peptic ulcer. intraduodenal administration of curcumin, 5&amp;#x2013;20;mg/kg, inhibited gastric acid secretion in pylorus-ligated rats, and oral administration prevented ethanol-induced acute gastric mucosal lesions. curcumin (20&amp;#x2013;80;mg/kg, p.o.) dose-dependently prevented both serotonin-induced gastric mucosal lesions and compound 48/80-induced gastric mucosal lesions in rats. furthermore, oral administration of curcumin, 10&amp;#x2013;80;mg/kg, twice daily for 10;days, significantly accelerated the healing of acetic acid-induced chronic gastric ulcer and promoted mucosal regeneration in the ulcerated portion in a dose-related manner. cimetidine prevented the formation of ethanol-induced gastric mucosal lesions, but not of serotonin-induced and compound 48/80-induced gastric mucosal lesions. consecutive administration of cimetidine showed a marked acceleration in the healing of acetic acid-induced ulcer. aminoguanidine, an inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) inhibitor, showed anti-ulcerogenic effects similar to those oberved for curcumin. the present results indicate that curcumin exhibits gastric cytoprotection in the acute lesion models and ulcer healing promotion in the chronic ulcer model. the preventive and curative effects of curcumin might be due to an increase in the mucosal defensive mechanism through its antioxidant property and inhibition of no or cytokine-mediated inflammation.</content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Hao-Feng Han | Norio Nakamura  | Masao Hattori

activity </title><content>febrifugine and isofebrifugine alkaloid mixtures extracted from the leaves and buds of hydrangea macrophylla var. otaksa, collected during different months, in japan, were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. leaves collected during the flowering season, namely from june to august, contained 0.16&amp;#8211;0.31;mg/g of the alkaloid mixture, whereas those collected from september to december had less than 0.03;mg/g of the mixture. however, extracts of buds harvested from october to february contained a consistently larger amount (more than 0.49;mg/g) of the alkaloids. hot-water extracts from the leaves and buds collected during different seasons were evaluated for antimalarial activity against plasmodium yoelii 17xl in mice. the extract of leaves collected in august demonstrated high antimalarial activity, and all mice that received the extract survived the infection. in contrast, the extract of leaves collected in december showed little activity. the extract of buds collected in december cleared parasites, but with subsequent mortality to mouse. the present results show that the amount of antimalarial agent&amp;#8212;febrifugine and isofebrifugine mixture&amp;#8212;in h. macrophylla var. otaksa is both part- and season-dependent, suggesting that the choice of plant parts and their harvesting season

such as aconitine, hipaconitine and mesaconitine. the standardization of the cultivation protocols must be established, since the quality of the crude drug, especially the content of aconite alkaloids, is influenced by cultivation conditions. here, we report the effects of planting depth, disbudding and root pruning on the content of the aconite alkaloids as well as on the weight of the root tuber of aconite. the daughter root tubers of shallow-planted plants showed a significantly higher content of aconitine, hipaconitine and sum of aconite alkaloids per unit weight than those of deeply planted root tubers (control group), while the average weight per root tuber was lower than that of the control group. the total weight of the daughter root tubers per plant of the disbudding group was significantly higher than that of other groups, including the root-pruning group whose average weight per tuber was the highest. in conclusion, disbudding is effective in achieving both higher content of aconite alkaloids and heavier total weight of the root tuber. </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Sachiko Tsukamoto  </authors><title>the search for inhibitors of the ubiquitin&amp;#8211;proteasome system from natural resources for drug development </title><content>the ubiquitin&amp;#8211;proteasome proteolytic pathway plays a major role in selective protein degradation and regulates various cellular events, including cell cycle progression, transcription, dna repair, signal transduction, and immune response. in this pathway, ubiquitin, a highly conserved small protein in eukaryotes, attaches to a target protein prior to degradation. the polyubiquitin chains are recognized by the 26s proteasome, and the protein portion is degraded by the proteolytic active sites in a cavity in the 26s proteasome. the potential of specific proteasome inhibitors, which act as anti-cancer agents, is now under intensive investigation, and bortezomib (ps-341, velcade), a proteasome inhibitor, was approved by the fda for multiple myeloma treatment in 2003. since ubiquitination of proteins requires the sequential action of three enzymes&amp;#8212;ubiquitin-activating enzyme (e1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (e2), and ubiquitin-protein ligase (e3)&amp;#8212;and polyubiquitination is a prerequisite for proteasome-mediated protein degradation, inhibitors of e1, e2, and e3 are reasonably thought to be drug candidates for treatment of diseases related to ubiquitination. in the course of our search for new classes of inhibitors against the ubiquitin&amp;#8211;proteasome proteolytic pathway from natural resources for drug development, we succeeded in isolating agosterols, secomycalolides a, and 1,3-diphenylpropane derivatives as inhibitors of chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome, himeic acid a as an e1 inhibitor, and (&amp;#8722;)-hexylitaconic acid as an inhibitor of p53&amp;#8211;hdm2 interaction. in addition, we found that girolline, an anticancer compound, is the first agent inhibiting the recruitment of polyubiquitinated p53 to the proteasome.

brewer&amp;#8217;s yeast-induced pyrexia tests in rats. the extract was prepared by soaking the dried powdered leaves of m. calabura in distilled water (dh2o) overnight. the supernatant obtained, considered as a stock solution (100% concentration/strength), was then diluted to concentrations of 10% and 50% and used together in all experimental models. the mcae, at concentrations of 10%, 50% and 100%, were found to show significant antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic activities in all tests. however, all of the activities occurred in a concentration-independent manner. the 50% and 100% concentrations of mcae produced insignificant antinociceptive and antipyretic activities, respectively. although the 100% concentration of mcae produced significant (p&amp;lt;0.05) anti-inflammatory activity, the activity was lower than that of the 10% and 50% concentrations of mcae. based on the results, we conclude that the m. calabura leaves possessed antinociceptive,

already been reported that the accumulation of fluoride can alter the activities of some enzymes involved in the free-radical metabolism and also decrease the activities of some enzymes involved in the antioxidant defense system. in the present study, we have investigated the antioxidative properties of aqueous extract of the bark of terminalia arjuna (ta) on sodium fluoride (naf) induced oxidative damages in the livers and kidneys of swiss albino mice. the mice were treated with 600;ppm naf for one week in drinking water and the activities of antioxidant enzymes, like superoxide dismutase (sod), catalase (cat), and glutathione-s-transferase (gst), and the levels of non-protein thiol, reduced glutathione (gsh), along with lipid peroxidation in the liver and kidney, were determined. fluoride administration significantly altered the levels of all of the factors compared to that of normal mice. dose- and time-dependent studies suggest that the aqueous extract of the bark of ta showed optimum protective activity against naf-induced oxidative damages at a dose of 40;mg/kg body weight for 10;days. oral administration of the extract for the specified dose and time followed by naf treatment (600;ppm) normalized the levels of the hepatic and renal antioxidant enzymes, gsh, and lipid peroxidation significantly to almost normal levels. the effects of a known antioxidant, vitamin e, and a non-relevant agent, bovine serum albumin (bsa), have also been included in the study. in addition, ta extract has been found to possess radical scavenging activity. combining all of the data, the results suggest that ta might possess a protective role against naf-induced hepatic and renal oxidative damages, probably via its antioxidant properties.

</title><content>a high molecular weight arabinogalactan protein (agp) from the pressed juice of echinacea purpurea, known to exhibit immunomodulatory properties in vitro, was characterized. alkaline hydrolysis was carried out, leading to degradation of the protein core and to carbohydrate moieties linked to the amino acid responsible for binding. gel permeation chromatography of these ag subunits

responsible for the binding between the protein and the ag subunits via an o-glycosidic linkage. large amounts of glutamine/glutamic acid (24.5% w/w) and asparagine/aspartic acid (17.3% w/w) were also found. polyclonal antibodies raised against the intact agp were shown to bind to the ag subunits too, indicating that the epitopes responsible for such interactions are localized in the polysaccharide

5-methyl-1-phenylhexen-3-yn-5-ol, 8,11-octadecadienoic acid-methyl ester, 5,7-(oh)2-4&amp;#8242;-one-6,8-dimethylflavanone, pinostrobin chalcone and 7-dimethoxyflavanone-5-hydroxy-4&amp;#8242;, were identified for the first time. glutathione (26.3;mg/g) was found in the water extract. dihydro-5,6-dehydrokavain (ddk) was present at a higher level than methysticin and desmethoxyyagonin, indicating that ddk is also a major constituent of kava roots. acetone was the most effective solvent in terms of maximum yield and types of kava lactones isolated, followed by water and chloroform, whereas hexane, methanol, and ethanol were less effective as solvents. total phenolic and antioxidant activity varied among the extracting solvents, with acetone and chloroform producing the highest effects, followed by water, while methanol, ethanol and hexane were less effective. </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Masanori Kuroyanagi  | Hiromi Ishii | Nobuo Kawahara | Hiroyuki

markovich) is obtained as a waste product in the course of tangerine orange juice production. this molasses is expected to be a useful source of organic compounds such as flavonoids and limonoids. to elucidate a use for this molasses waste, we isolated and identified its organic constituents. two new flavanonol glycosides were isolated from tangerine orange molasses, along with several flavonoids such as hesperidine, narirutin, eriodictyol, 3&amp;#8242;,4&amp;#8242;,5,6,7,8-hexamethoxy-3-o-&amp;#946;-d-glucopyranosyloxyflavone, and 3&amp;#8242;,4&amp;#8242;,5,6,7,8-hexamethoxy- 3-&amp;#946;-d-[4-o-(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaloyl)]-glucopyranosyloxyflavone, and limonoids such as limonin, nomilin, and cyclic peptide, citrusin iii. the structures of the new flavanonol glycosides were determined as (2r,3r)-7-o-(6-o-&amp;#945;-l-rahmnopyranosyl-&amp;#946;-d-glucopyranosyl)-aromadendrin and 7-o-(6-o-&amp;#945;-

polyphenols from kapur (dryobalanops sp.) heartwood extracts </title><content>the inhibitory effects of 50% aqueous ethanol extracts obtained from 36 tropical woody plants species on glucosyltransferase (gtase) activity were studied. out of the 36 species examined, those obtained from kapur (dryobalanops sp.), a species growing in kalimantan (indonesia), showed the highest level of gtase inhibition. kapur extracts were further subjected to fractionation using column chromatography (lh-20 gel, cellulose and c-18 silica gel column). lh-20 gel provided the most successful method of fractionation. the separated fractions showed positive with folin-ciocalteau&amp;#8217;s reagent and negative with vanillin-hcl reagent, indicating that the main constituents of the active fractions were polyphenols but not proanthocyanidin (condensed tannins). results of the assay for protein precipitating ability with bovine serum albumin (bsa) solution suggested these polyphenols have strong protein-precipitating ability. the predominant compound produced after acid hydrolysis was ellagic acid, indicating that the gtase-inhibitory components were mainly ellagitannins. two polyphenolic compounds referred to as compounds 1 and 2 were isolated from the water eluate fraction with lh-20 gel column, and these compounds showed comparatively strong gtase-inhibitory activities and relatively low molecular weight. using a combination of two-dimensional, 1h and 13c nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, compound 1 was identified as 4-methoxy-2-[tetrahydro-3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)pyran-2-yl]-&amp;#945;-resorcylic acid &amp;#948;&amp;#8211;lactone (bergenin), and 2 was identified as 4-o-(&amp;#945;-rhamnopyranosyl)

potentiation (ltp) in the dentate gyrus in vivo. we confirmed that crocin inhibits tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-&amp;#945;-induced apoptosis of pc-12 cells. pc-12 cells showed a rapid increase in cellular ceramide levels, followed by an increase in the phosphorylation of c-jun kinase (jnk), leading to apoptosis by serum/glucose deprivation in the medium. the production of ceramide was dependent on the activation of magnesium-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase (n-smase), but not on de novo synthesis. the oxidative stress also decreased the cellular levels of glutathione (gsh), which is the potent inhibitor of n-smase. crocin treatment resulted in the prevention of n-smase activation, ceramide production and jnk phosphorylation. exploration of the crocin&amp;#8217;s preventive mechanism in oxidative stress-induced cell death revealed that the activities of gsh reductase and &amp;#947;-glutamylcysteinyl synthase (&amp;#947;-gcs) in the &amp;#947;-glutamyl cycle affected the stable gsh supply that blocks the activation of n-smase. these results strongly support the importance of the proposed gsh-dependent inhibitory mechanism in oxidative stress-mediated cell death.

</authors><title>phyllanthus maderaspatensis, a dietary supplement for the amelioration of adriamycin-induced toxicity and oxidative stress in mice </title><content>the effect of ethanol extract of phyllanthus maderaspatensis (pme), a popular south indian dietary supplement, was studied for its chemoprotective property on adriamycin (adr)-induced toxicity and oxidative stress in mice. adriamycin toxicity was evaluated biochemically by measuring the serum concentration of lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) and creatinine phosphokinase (cpk). genotoxicity was evaluated by measuring the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (mnpces) in bone marrow cells. oxidative stress in the heart tissue was estimated by measuring the glutathione (gsh) levels in the homogenate. the treatment of mice with different doses of pme (400;mg/kg and 600;mg/kg body weight, p.o.,) for 7;days before the administration of a single i.p. dose of adr (15;mg/kg) exhibited significant protection in a dose-dependent manner. the results clearly indicate that pme has a protective effect against adr-induced toxicity, as revealed by the decrease in the concentrations of ldh, cpk, and the frequency of mnpces. the increased levels of gsh are indicative of the antioxidant property of pme. </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Bidyut K  Datta | M  Mukhlesur Rahman | Alex|er I  Gray

</title><content>effects of hochu-ekki-to (tj-41) on the course of lethal rodent malarial infection with plasmodium chabaudi as were examined in male a/j mice. we examined the mortality, parasitemia and serum cytokines such as il-12, ifn-&amp;#947; and il-4 in the infected and tj-41-treated/infected mice. there was a significant difference in mortality between infected and treated/infected mice. a high mortality was observed in male mice after infection with p. chabaudi as. in mice treated with tj-41, control of the primary infection was achieved, and significantly lower mortality was observed. all surviving males in the treated/infected group showed somewhat smaller peak parasitemias than those in infected controls. mice in the infected and treated/infected groups displayed significantly elevated serum il-12 levels on day 4 of infection when compared with the levels from the uninfected animals. mice in the infected and treated/infected groups displayed significantly elevated serum ifn-&amp;#947; levels when compared with the levels from the uninfected animals. furthermore, a significantly higher ifn-&amp;#947; level was seen in the treated/infected group than that in the infected group on day 4 of infection. the present results suggest that an early production of ifn-&amp;#947; in the tj-41-treated/infected mice is associated with a decrease of

modulates changes in cytochrome p450 caused by mycobacterium butyricum injection </title><content>a large number of infectious or inflammatory agents are well known to reduce cytochrome p450-catalyzed drug metabolism in the liver. changes in the levels of hepatic p450s in infectious or inflammatory diseases can lead to alteration in physiology, therapeutic failure, and disease development. this study was therefore designed to examine the effect of shosaikoto, a kampo medicine used for treatment of chronic hepatitis and acute flu, on the changes in p450 activity and protein levels following intravenous injection of mycobacterium butyricum. intravenous injection of m. butyricum into rats reduced hepatic p450: cyp1a1, 1a2, 2b, and 3a activities and cyp2e1 and 3a2 protein levels. when administered orally to rats for 2;weeks since 1;week before m. butyricum injection, shosaikoto prevented the reduction in cyp1a1, 1a2, 2b, and 3a activities dose dependently and further abrogated the repression of cyp3a2 protein but not cyp2e1 protein. serum c-reactive protein levels in this rat model were not highly elevated, and neither were significantly influenced by shosaikoto treatment. taken together, these results suggest that shosaikoto would be capable of modulating the change in hepatic p450 caused by m. butyricum injection and the effect, which might not be brought about by its anti-inflammatory activity but by translational or posttranslational regulation, appears to differ in each p450 isoform. </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Jue Wang | Liyan Wang
