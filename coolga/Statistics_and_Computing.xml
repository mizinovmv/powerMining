Jain1  | Chitra Dorai2 </authors><title>3D object recognition: Representation and matching</title><content>Three-dimensional object recognition entails a number of fundamental problems in computer vision: representation of a 3D object, identification of the object from its image, estimation of its position and orientation, and registration of multiple views of the object for automatic model construction. This paper surveys three of those topics, namely representation, matching, and pose estimation. It also presents an overview of the free-form surface matching problem, and describes COSMOS, our framework for representing and recognizing free-form objects. The COSMOS system recognizes arbitrarily curved 3D rigid objects from a single view using dense surface data. We present both the theoretical aspects and the experimental results of a prototype recognition system based on COSMOS.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>T. Fearn| P. J.

Besbeas</authors><title>A Bayesian decision theory approach to variable selection for discrimination</title><content>Motivated by examples in spectroscopy, we study variable selection for discrimination in problems with very many predictor variables. Assuming multivariate normal distributions with common variance for the predictor variables within groups, we develop a Bayesian decision theory approach that balances costs for variables against a loss due to classification errors. The approach is computationally intensive, requiring a simulation to approximate the intractable expected loss and a search, using simulated annealing, over a large space of possible subsets of variables. It is illustrated by application to a spectroscopic example with 3 groups, 100 variables, and 71 training cases, where the approach finds subsets of between 5 and 14 variables whose discriminatory power is comparable with that of linear discriminant analysis using principal components derived from the full 100 variables. We study both the evaluation of expected loss and the tuning of the simulated annealing for the example, and conclude that computational effort should be concentrated on the search.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Mark J. Brewer1 </authors><title>A Bayesian model for local smoothing in kernel density estimation</title><content>A new procedure is proposed for deriving variable bandwidths in univariate kernel density estimation, based upon likelihood cross-validation and an analysis of a Bayesian graphical model. The procedure admits bandwidth selection which is flexible in terms of the amount of smoothing required. In addition, the basic model can be extended to incorporate local smoothing of the density estimate. The method is shown to perform well in both theoretical and practical situations, and we compare our method with those of Abramson (The Annals of Statistics 10: 1217&amp;#x2013;1223) and Sain and Scott (Journal of the American Statistical Association 91: 1525&amp;#x2013;1534). In particular, we note that in certain cases, the Sain and Scott method performs poorly even with relatively large sample sizes.We compare various bandwidth selection methods using standard mean integrated square error criteria to assess the quality of the density estimates. We study situations where the underlying density is assumed both known and unknown, and note that in practice, our method performs well when sample sizes are small. In addition, we also apply the methods to real data, and again we believe our methods perform at least as well as existing methods.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Dipak K.

After a reduction of the sample, computing the distance between the remaining points and using the distribution of the kth nearest neighbour enables clusters of points to be built up, hopefully fitting the regions of attraction of significant local optima; from each of these a local search is started. The properties of the method are analysed, and detailed computational results on standard test functions are provided.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Silvia Polettini1  | Julian St|er2</authors><title>A comment on A theoretical basis for perturbation methods by Krishnamurty Muralidhar and Rathindra Sarathy</title><content>Without Abstract</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>David Maxwell Chickering1  | David Heckerman2 </authors><title>A comparison of scientific and engineering criteria for Bayesian model selection</title><content>Given a set of possible models for variables X and a set of possible parameters for each model, the Bayesian estimate of the probability distribution for X given observed data is obtained by averaging over the possible models and their parameters. An often-used approximation for this estimate is obtained by selecting a single model and averaging over its parameters. The approximation is useful because it is computationally efficient, and because it provides a model that facilitates understanding of the domain. A common criterion for model selection is the posterior probability of the model. Another criterion for model selection, proposed by San Martini and Spezzafari (1984), is the predictive performance of a model for the next observation to be seen. From the standpoint of domain understanding, both criteria are useful, because one identifies the model that is most likely, whereas the other identifies the model that is the best predictor of the next observation. To highlight the difference, we refer to the posterior-probability and alternative criteria as the scientific criterion (SC) and engineering criterion (EC), respectively. When we are interested in predicting the next observation, the model-averaged estimate is at least as good as that produced by EC, which itself is at least as good as the estimate produced by SC. We show experimentally that, for Bayesian-network models containing discrete variables only, the predictive performance of the model average can be significantly better than those of single models selected by either criterion, and that differences between models selected by the two criterion can be substantial.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>K.

Brian Gray1</authors><title>A computational framework for variable selection in multivariate regression</title><content>Stepwise variable selection procedures are computationally inexpensive methods for constructing useful regression models for a single dependent variable. At each step a variable is entered into or deleted from the current model, based on the criterion of minimizing the error sum of squares (SSE). When there is more than one dependent variable, the situation is more complex. In this article we propose variable selection criteria for multivariate regression which generalize the univariate SSE criterion. Specifically, we suggest minimizing some function of the estimated error covariance matrix: the trace, the determinant, or the largest eigenvalue. The computations associated with these criteria may be burdensome. We develop a computational framework based on the use of the SWEEP operator which greatly reduces these calculations for stepwise variable selection in multivariate regression.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Ruggero Bellio1 | Aless|ra R.

Attention has been restricted to the context of exact and approximate inference for a parameter of interest conditionally either on an ancillary statistic or on a statistic partially sufficient for the nuisance parameter. In particular, the procedures apply to regression-scale models and multiparameter exponential families. Most of them support algebraic computation as well as numerical calculation for a given data set. Examples illustrate the code.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>A. N. Pettitt| I. S. Weir | A. G. Hart</authors><title>A Conditional Autoregressive Gaussian Process for Irregularly Spaced Multivariate Data with Application to Modelling Large Sets of Binary Data</title><content>A Gaussian conditional autoregressive (CAR) formulation is presented that permits the modelling of the spatial dependence and the dependence between multivariate random variables at irregularly spaced sites so capturing some of the modelling advantages of the geostatistical approach. The model benefits not only from the explicit availability of the full conditionals but also from the computational simplicity of the precision matrix determinant calculation using a closed form expression involving the eigenvalues of a precision matrix submatrix. The introduction of covariates into the model adds little computational complexity to the analysis and thus the method can be straightforwardly extended to regression models. The model, because of its computational simplicity, is well suited to application involving the fully Bayesian analysis of large data sets involving multivariate measurements with a spatial ordering. An extension to spatio-temporal data is also considered. Here, we demonstrate use of the model in the analysis of bivariate binary data where the observed data is modelled as the sign of the hidden CAR process. A case study involving over 450 irregularly spaced sites and the presence or absence of each of two species of rain forest trees at each site is presented; Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are implemented to obtain posterior distributions of all unknowns. The MCMC method works well with simulated data and the tree biodiversity data set.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>B&amp;auml rbel F.

Using simulated time series from various nonlinear models we illustrate how this feature can be traced from conditional density estimation. We study whether two statistics derived from the likelihood function can serve as univariate statistics to determine the order of the process. It is found that a weighted version of the log likelihood function has desirable robust properties in detecting the order of the process.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Murray Jorgensen</authors><title>A dynamic EM algorithm for estimating mixture proportions</title><content>We investigate the use of a dynamic form of the EM algorithm to estimate proportions in finite mixtures of known distributions.

The predictability index  is proposed as a splitting rule for growing the same classification tree as CART does when using the Gini index of heterogeneity as an impurity measure. A theorem is introduced to show a new property of the index : the  for a given predictor has a value not lower than the  for any split generated by the predictor. This property is used to make a substantial saving in the time required to generate a classification tree. Three simulation studies are presented in order to show the computational gain in terms of both the number of splits analysed at each node and the CPU time. The proposed splitting algorithm can prove computational efficiency in real data sets as shown in an example.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Murray Aitkin | Roberto Rocci</authors><title>A general maximum likelihood analysis of measurement error in generalized linear models</title><content>This paper describes an EM algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation in generalized linear models (GLMs) with continuous measurement error in the explanatory variables. The algorithm is an adaptation of that for nonparametric maximum likelihood (NPML) estimation in overdispersed GLMs described in Aitkin (Statistics and Computing 6: 251&amp;#x2013;262, 1996). The measurement error distribution can be of any specified form, though the implementation described assumes normal measurement error. Neither the reliability nor the distribution of the true score of the variables with measurement error has to be known, nor are instrumental variables or replication required.Standard errors can be obtained by omitting individual variables from the model, as in Aitkin (1996).</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Murray Aitkin1</authors><title>A general maximum likelihood analysis of overdispersion in generalized linear models</title><content>This paper presents an EM algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation in generalized linear models with overdispersion. The algorithm is initially derived as a form of Gaussian quadrature assuming a normal mixing distribution, but with only slight variation it can be used for a completely unknown mixing distribution, giving a straightforward method for the fully non-parametric ML estimation of this distribution. This is of value because the ML estimates of the GLM parameters may be sensitive to the specification of a parametric form for the mixing distribution. A listing of a GLIM4 algorithm for fitting the overdispersed binomial logit model is given in an appendix.A simple method is given for obtaining correct standard errors for parameter estimates when using the EM algorithm.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Darrell Whitley1</authors><title>A genetic algorithm tutorial</title><content>This tutorial covers the canonical genetic algorithm as well as more experimental forms of genetic algorithms, including parallel island models and parallel cellular genetic algorithms.

The present paper introduces a modification of the sampling technique, by defining a hybrid Markov chain in which, after each Gibbs sampling cycle, a Metropolis step is carried out along a direction of constant likelihood. Examples with simulated data sets motivate and illustrate the new technique. A proof of the ergodicity of the hybrid Markov chain is also given.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>F. M. Malvestuto1 </authors><title>A hypergraph-theoretic analysis of collapsibility and decomposability for extended log-linear models</title><content>Extended log-linear models (ELMs) are the natural generalization of log-linear models when the positivity assumption is relaxed. The hypergraph language, which is currently used to specify the syntax of ELMs, both provides an insight into key notions of the theory of ELMs such as collapsibility and decomposability, and allows to work out efficient algorithms to solve some problems of inference. This is the case for the three search problems addressed in this paper and referred to as the approximation problem, the selective-reduction problem and the synthesis problem. The approximation problem consists in finding the smallest decomposable ELM that contains a given ELM and is such that the given ELM is collapsible onto each of its generators. The selective-reduction problem consists in deleting the maximum number of generators of a given ELM in such a way that the resulting ELM is a submodel and none of certain variables of interest is missing. The synthesis problem consists in finding a minimal ELM containing the intersection of ELMs specified by given independence relations. We show that each of the three search problems above can be reduced to an equivalent search problem on hypergraphs, which can be solved in polynomial time.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>K. A. Froeschl1</authors><title>A metadata approach to statistical query processing</title><content>Concerning the task of integrating census and survey data from different sources as it is carried out by supranational statistical agencies, a formal metadata approach is investigated which supports data integration and table processing simultaneously. To this end, a metadata model is devised such that statistical query processing is accomplished by means of symbolic reasoning on machine-readable, operative metadata. As in databases, statistical queries are stated as formal expressions specifying declaratively what the intended output is; the operations necessary to retrieve appropriate available source data and to aggregate source data into the requested macrodata are derived mechanically. Using simple mathematics, this paper focuses particularly on the metadata model devised to harmonize semantically related data sources as well as the table model providing the principal data structure of the proposed system. Only an outline of the general design of a statistical information system based on the proposed metadata model is given and the state of development is summarized briefly.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>W. James Gauderman1</authors><title>A method for simulating familial disease data with variable age at onset and genetic and environmental effects</title><content>The field of genetic epidemiology is growing rapidly with the realization that many important diseases are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. For this reason, pedigree data are becoming increasingly valuable as a means of studying patterns of disease occurrence. Analysis of pedigree data is complicated by the lack of independence among family members and by the non-random sampling schemes used to ascertain families. An additional complicating factor is the variability in age at disease onset from one person to another. In developing statistical methods for analysing pedigree data, analytic results are often intractable, making simulation studies imperative for assessing the performance of proposed methods and estimators. In this paper, an algorithm is presented for simulating disease data in pedigrees, incorporating variable age at onset and genetic and environmental effects. Computational formulas are developed in the context of a proportional hazards model and assuming single ascertainment of families, but the methods can be easily generalized to alternative models. The algorithm is computationally efficient, making multi-dataset simulation studies feasible. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the methods.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Murray Aitkin1| 2| Steve Finch3| 2| Nancy Mendell3| 2 | Henry Thode4| 2</authors><title>A new test for the presence of a normal mixture distribution based on the posterior Bayes factor</title><content>We present a new test for the presence of a normal mixture distribution, based on the posterior Bayes factor of Aitkin (1991).

It involves either centring or standardising each variable within each group before randomly permuting observations between groups. Since the assumption of exchangeability of observations between groups does not strictly hold following such transformations, Monte Carlo simulations were used to compare expected and empirical rejection levels as a function of group size, the number of groups and distribution type (Normal, mixtures of Normals and Gamma with various values of the shape parameter). The Monte Carlo study showed that the estimated probability levels are close to those that would be obtained with an exact test except at very small sample sizes (5 or 10 observations per group). The test appears robust against non-normal data, different numbers of groups or variables per group and unequal sample sizes per group. Power was increased with increasing sample size, effect size and the number of elements in the matrix and power was decreased with increasingly unequal numbers of observations per group.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Fern|o Tusell1 </authors><title>A permutation test for randomness with power against smooth variation</title><content>A permutation test for the white noise hypothesis is described, offering power against a general class of smooth alternatives.

In this paper a method for resampling time series generated by a chaotic dynamical system is proposed. The basic idea is to develop an algorithm for building trajectories which lie on the same attractor of the true DGP, that is with the same dynamical and geometrical properties of the original data. We performed some numerical experiments on some short noise-free and high-noise series confirming that we are able to correctly reproduce the distribution of the largest finite-time Lyapunov exponent and of the correlation dimension.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>N.

Parallel processing, the application of parallel computers, has been successfully utilized in many fields of science and technology. The purpose of this paper is to review efforts to use parallel processing for statistical computing. We present some technical background, followed by a review of the literature that relates parallel computing to statistics.

PEARCE1</authors><title>A robust logistic discrimination model</title><content>Logistic discrimination is a well documented method for classifying observations to two or more groups. However, estimation of the discriminant rule can be seriously affected by outliers. To overcome this, Cox and Ferry produced a robust logistic discrimination technique. Although their method worked in practice, parameter estimation was sometimes prone to convergence problems. This paper proposes a simplified robust logistic model which does not have any such problems and which takes a generalized linear model form. Misclassification rates calculated in a simulation exercise are used to compare the new method with ordinary logistic discrimination. Model diagnostics are also presented. The newly proposed model is then used on data collected from pregnant women at two district general hospitals. A robust logistic discriminant is calculated which can be used to predict accurately which method of feeding a woman will eventually use: breast feeding or bottle feeding.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Morgan C.

Specifically, both the mean and variance are modelled using semi-parametric additive models. We call this model a Mean And Dispersion Additive Model (MADAM). A successive relaxation algorithm for fitting the model is described and justified as maximizing a penalized likelihood function with penalties for lack of smoothness in the additive non-parametric functions in both mean and variance models. The algorithm is implemented in GLIM4, allowing flexible and interactive modelling of variance heterogeneity.

Models derived from these approximations are fitted to a region of the observed joint tail which is determined by suitably chosen high thresholds. A drawback of the existing methods is the necessity for the same thresholds to be taken for the convergence of both marginal and dependence aspects, which can result in inefficient estimation. In this paper an extension of the existing models, which removes this constraint, is proposed. The resulting model is semi-parametric and requires computationally intensive techniques for likelihood evaluation. The methods are illustrated using a coastal engineering application.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Alan D.

Exact inference in these networks is simply not feasible owing to the huge storage requirements of exact methods. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, however, are able to deal with these large networks but to do this they require an initial legal configuration to set off the sampler. So far nondeterministic methods such as forward sampling have often been used for this, even though the forward sampler may take an eternity to come up with a legal configuration. In this paper a novel algorithm will be presented that allows a legal configuration in a general Bayesian network to be found in polynomial time in almost all cases. The algorithm will not be proved deterministic but empirical results will demonstrate that this holds in most cases. Also, the algorithm will be justified by its simplicity and ease of implementation.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Jeffrey S. Simonoff1</authors><title>A simple, automatic and adaptive bivariate density estimator based on conditional densities</title><content>The standard approach to non-parametric bivariate density estimation is to use a kernel density estimator. Practical performance of this estimator is hindered by the fact that the estimator is not adaptive (in the sense that the level of smoothing is not sensitive to local properties of the density). In this paper a simple, automatic and adaptive bivariate density estimator is proposed based on the estimation of marginal and conditional densities. Asymptotic properties of the estimator are examined, and guidance to practical application of the method is given. Application to two examples illustrates the usefulness of the estimator as an exploratory tool, particularly in situations where the local behaviour of the density varies widely. The proposed estimator is also appropriate for use as a pilot estimate for an adaptive kernel estimate, since it is relatively inexpensive to calculate.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>M.

A continuing source of uncertainty is how long such a sampler must be run in order to converge approximately to its target stationary distribution. A method has previously been developed to compute rigorous theoretical upper bounds on the number of iterations required to achieve a specified degree of convergence in total variation distance by verifying drift and minorization conditions. We propose the use of auxiliary simulations to estimate the numerical values needed in this theorem. Our simulation method makes it possible to compute quantitative convergence bounds for models for which the requisite analytical computations would be prohibitively difficult or impossible. On the other hand, although our method appears to perform well in our example problems, it cannot provide the guarantees offered by analytical proof.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>David J.

All methods involve matching estimated and expected autocorrelations of the binary series. In particular, we focus on the spectral representation of the likelihood of an ARMA process and derive a restricted form of this likelihood, which uses correlations at only the first few lags. We contrast these methods with an efficient but computationally-intensive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. In a simulation study we show that, for a range of ARMA processes, the spectral method is more efficient than variants of least squares and much faster than MCMC. We illustrate by fitting an ARMA(2,1) model to a binary time series of cow feeding data.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>W. J.

Two algorithms for tackling the problem, iterated conditional modes (ICM) and simulated annealing, are usually applied pixel by pixel. The performance of this strategy can be poor, particularly for heavily degraded images, and as a potential improvement Jubb and Jennison (1991) suggest the cascade algorithm in which ICM is initially applied to coarser images formed by blocking squares of pixels. In this paper we attempt to resolve certain criticisms of cascade and present a version of the algorithm extended in definition and implementation.

In developing this new theoretical basis, we define the ideal measures of data utility and disclosure risk. Maximum data utility is achieved when the statistical characteristics of the perturbed data are the same as that of the original data. Disclosure risk is minimized if providing users with microdata access does not result in any additional information. We show that when the perturbed values of the confidential variables are generated as independent realizations from the distribution of the confidential variables conditioned on the non-confidential variables, they satisfy the data utility and disclosure risk requirements. We also discuss the relationship between the theoretical basis and some commonly used methods for generating perturbed values of confidential numerical variables.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Alex J.

Despite the straightforwardness of its implementation using the Gibbs sampler, the ordinal probit may present challenges in obtaining satisfactory convergence.We present a multivariate Hastings-within-Gibbs update step for generating latent data and bin boundary parameters jointly, instead of individually from their respective full conditionals. When the latent data are parameters of interest, this algorithm substantially improves Gibbs sampler convergence for large datasets.

However, reasonable estimators are possible, even in several dimensions, under appropriate restrictions on the complexity of the curve. In the present paper we explore how much appropriate wavelet estimators can exploit a typical restriction on the curve such as additivity. We first propose an adaptive and simultaneous estimation procedure for all additive components in additive regression models and discuss rate of convergence results and data-dependent truncation rules for wavelet series estimators. To speed up computation we then introduce a wavelet version of functional ANOVA algorithm for additive regression models and propose a regularization algorithm which guarantees an adaptive solution to the multivariate estimation problem. Some simulations indicate that wavelets methods complement nicely the existing methodology for nonparametric multivariate curve estimation.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Jean Thioulouse1| Daniel Chessel1| Sylvain Dole&amp;acute dec | Jean-Michel Olivier1</authors><title>ADE-4: a multivariate analysis and graphical display software</title><content>We present ADE-4, a multivariate analysis and graphical display software. Multivariate analysis methods available in ADE-4 include usual one-table methods like principal component analysis and correspondence analysis, spatial data analysis methods (using a total variance decomposition into local and global components, analogous to Moran and Geary indices), discriminant analysis and within/between groups analyses, many linear regression methods including lowess and polynomial regression, multiple and PLS (partial least squares) regression and orthogonal regression (principal component regression), projection methods like principal component analysis on instrumental variables, canonical correspondence analysis and many other variants, coinertia analysis and the RLQ method, and several three-way table (k-table) analysis methods. Graphical display techniques include an automatic collection of elementary graphics corresponding to groups of rows or to columns in the data table, thus providing a very efficient way for automatic k-table graphics and geographical mapping options. A dynamic graphic module allows interactive operations like searching, zooming, selection of points, and display of data values on factor maps.

These are called statistical objects because they are complex data structures (vectors, matrices, relations, time series, etc) which may have different possible representations (e.g. tables, relations, vectors, pie-charts, bar-charts, graphs, and so on). For this reason a statistical object is defined by two different types of attribute (a summary attribute, with its own summary type and with its own instances, called summary data, and the set of category attributes, which describe the summary attribute). Some conceptual models of statistical data (CSM, SDM4S), some semantic models of statistical data (SCM, SAM*, OSAM*), and some graphical models of statistical data (SUBJECT, GRASS, STORM) are also discussed.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>I.

The procedure consists of two steps: a projection of the data set to a reduced dimension using a non-linear transformation whose parameters are determined by the solution of a generalized symmetric eigenvector equation. This is achieved by demanding a maximum variance transformation subject to a normalization condition (Hotelling's approach) and can be related to the homogeneity analysis approach of Gifi through the minimization of a loss function. The transformed variables are the principal components whose values define contours, or more generally hypersurfaces, in the data space. The second stage of the procedure defines the fitting surface, the principal surface, in the data space (again as a weighted sum of kernel basis functions) using the definition of self-consistency of Hastie and Stuetzle. The parameters of this principal surface are determined by a singular value decomposition and crossvalidation is used to obtain the kernel bandwidths. The approach is assessed on four data sets.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>D.

Using a simulation study, we also compare the efficiency of Monte Carlo and Gaussian quadrature methods for approximating the mixture distribution. The new approach with Gaussian quadrature outperforms the alternative methods considered.

The proposed algorithm is computationally straightforward and its convergence is guaranteed. A simulation and three real data sets, including the challenging salamander data, are used to illustrate the procedure and to compare it with some existing methods.

Here, it is shown how one can use the Markov chain transitions for such an annealing sequence to define an importance sampler. The Markov chain aspect allows this method to perform acceptably even for high-dimensional problems, where finding good importance sampling distributions would otherwise be very difficult, while the use of importance weights ensures that the estimates found converge to the correct values as the number of annealing runs increases. This annealed importance sampling procedure resembles the second half of the previously-studied tempered transitions, and can be seen as a generalization of a recently-proposed variant of sequential importance sampling. It is also related to thermodynamic integration methods for estimating ratios of normalizing constants. Annealed importance sampling is most attractive when isolated modes are present, or when estimates of normalizing constants are required, but it may also be more generally useful, since its independent sampling allows one to bypass some of the problems of assessing convergence and autocorrelation in Markov chain samplers.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>&amp;Oslash yvind Langsrud</authors><title>ANOVA for unbalanced data: Use Type II instead of Type III sums of squares</title><content>Methods for analyzing unbalanced factorial designs can be traced back to Yates (1934).

As criticized by Nelder and Lane (1995), this analysis is founded on unrealistic models&amp;#x2014;models with interactions, but without all corresponding main effects. The Type II analysis (Yates's method of fitting constants) is usually not preferred because of the underlying assumption of no interactions.

The modularity of our protection mechanism (perturbation is applied after the query processing, not during it or upon data entry, as in the other approaches) facilitates the implementation. The method presented is user-oriented and since the usability (accuracy) of the statistically altered answers can be fine-tuned, the balance between usability and protection (security) is under the control of the database administrator.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>OUHONG WANG1 | WILLIAM J.

Interval analysis, instead, uses interval elements throughout the computation and produces intervals as output with the guarantee that the true results are contained in them. One major use for interval analysis in statistics is to get results of high-dimensional multivariate probabilities. With the efforts to decrease the length of the intervals that contain the theoretically true answers, we can obtain results to any arbitrary accuracy, which is demonstrated by multivariate normal and multivariate t integrations. This is an advantage over the approximation methods that are currently in use. Since interval analysis is more computationally intensive than traditional computing, a MasPar parallel computer is used in this research to improve performance.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>K.

For the linear predictor Gauss-Hermite integration is carried out with automatic reparametrization based on an approximate posterior mode filter. We illustrate how further topics in applied state space modelling, such as estimating hyperparameters, computing model likelihoods and predictive residuals, are managed by integration-based Kalman-filtering.

A first way to         compute approximate p-values for statistics derived from this process consists of using the parametric bootstrap procedure recently thoroughly         revisited by Genest and RГ©millard. Because it heavily relies on random number generation and estimation, the resulting goodness-of-fit         test has a very high computational cost that can be regarded as an obstacle to its application as the sample size increases.         An alternative approach proposed by the authors consists of using a multiplier procedure. The study of the finite-sample performance of the multiplier version of the goodness-of-fit test for bivariate         one-parameter copulas showed that it provides a valid alternative to the parametric bootstrap-based test while being orders         of magnitude faster. The aim of this work is to extend the multiplier approach to multivariate multiparameter copulas and         study the finite-sample performance of the resulting test. Particular emphasis is put on elliptical copulas such as the normal         and the t as these are flexible models in a multivariate setting. The implementation of the procedure for the latter copulas proves         challenging and requires the extension of the Plackett formula for the t distribution to arbitrary dimension. Extensive Monte Carlo experiments, which could be carried out only because of the good         computational properties of the multiplier approach, confirm in the multivariate multiparameter context the satisfactory behavior         of the goodness-of-fit test.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Eun-Kyung Lee1  | Dianne Cook2</authors><title>A projection pursuit index for large p small n data      </title><content>In high-dimensional data, one often seeks a few interesting low-dimensional projections which reveal important aspects of         the data.

Whereas such combinatorial problems are extremely difficult to solve exactly, something less than the global optimum         can be &amp;#8216;good enough&amp;#8217; for many practical purposes, as shown by example. Again, a relaxation strategy embeds these discrete,         high-dimensional problems in continuous, low-dimensional ones. Overall, nonlinear optimisation methods can be exploited to         provide a single, reasonably fast algorithm to handle a wide variety of problems of this kind, thereby providing a certain         unity. Four running examples illustrate the approach. On the robustness side, algorithmic approximations to minimum covariance         determinant (MCD) and least trimmed squares (LTS) estimation. And, on the diagnostic side, detection of multiple multivariate         outliers and global diagnostic use of the likelihood displacement function.

Nott1  | Li Jialiang1</authors><title>A sign based loss approach to model selection in nonparametric regression      </title><content>In parametric regression models the sign of a coefficient often plays an important role in its interpretation. One possible         approach to model selection in these situations is to consider a loss function that formulates prediction of the sign of a         coefficient as a decision problem. Taking a Bayesian approach, we extend this idea of a sign based loss for selection to more         complex situations. In generalized additive models we consider prediction of the sign of the derivative of an additive term         at a set of predictors. Being able to predict the sign of the derivative at some point (that is, whether a term is increasing         or decreasing) is one approach to selection of terms in additive modelling when interpretation is the main goal. For models         with interactions, prediction of the sign of a higher order derivative can be used similarly. There are many advantages to         our sign-based strategy for selection: one can work in a full or encompassing model without the need to specify priors on         a model space and without needing to specify priors on parameters in submodels. Also, avoiding a search over a large model         space can simplify computation. We consider shrinkage prior specifications on smoothing parameters that allow for good predictive         performance in models with large numbers of terms without the need for selection, and a frequentist calibration of the parameter         in our sign-based loss function when it is desired to control a false selection rate for interpretation.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Marco S|ri1 | Paola Zuccolotto1 </authors><title>Analysis and correction of bias in Total Decrease in Node Impurity measures for tree-based algorithms      </title><content>Variable selection is one of the main problems faced by data mining and machine learning techniques.

This paper considers Total Decrease in Node         Impurity (TDNI) measures, a popular class of variable importance measures defined in the field of decision trees and tree-based         ensemble methods, like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines. In spite of their wide use, some measures of this class         are known to be biased and some correction strategies have been proposed. The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, to investigate         the source and the characteristics of bias in TDNI measures using the notions of informative and uninformative splits. Secondly,         a bias-correction algorithm, recently proposed for the Gini measure in the context of classification, is extended to the entire         class of TDNI measures and its performance is investigated in the regression framework using simulated and real data.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Gavino Puggioni1  | Alan E.

Sensor networks are becoming an increasingly common data collection mechanism in a variety of fields. Sensors         can be created to collect data at very high temporal resolution. However, during periods when the process is following a stable         path, transmission of such high resolution data would carry little additional information with regard to the process model,         i.e., all of the data that is collected need not be transmitted. In particular, when there is cost to transmission, we find         ourselves moving to consideration of suppression in transmission. Additionally, for many sensor networks, in practice, we         will experience failures in transmission&amp;#8212;messages sent by a sensor but not received at the gateway, messages sent but arriving         corrupted. Evidently, both suppression and failure lead to information loss which will be reflected in inference associated         with our process model. Our effort here is to assess the impact of such information loss under varying extents of suppression         and varying incidence of failure. We consider two illustrative process models, presenting fully model-based analyses of suppression         and failure using hierarchical models.

In         this article, we demonstrate how these obstacles can be overcome by the application of the constrained maximum likelihood         estimation and truncated approximation. The present work is motivated by confidence interval construction for the risk difference         under inverse sampling. Wald-type and score-type confidence intervals based on inverting two one-sided and one two-sided tests         are considered. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of these confidence intervals with respect         to empirical coverage probability, empirical confidence width, and empirical left and right non-coverage probabilities. Two         examples from a maternal congenital heart disease study and a drug comparison study are used to demonstrate the proposed methodologies.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Mari MyllymГ¤ki1  | Antti Penttinen1</authors><title>Bayesian inference for Gaussian excursion set generated Cox processes with set-marking      </title><content>This work considers spatial Cox point processes where the random intensity is defined by a random closed set such that different         point intensities appear in the two phases formed by the random set and its complement. The point pattern is observed as a         set of point coordinates in a bounded region W&amp;#8834;&amp;#8477;            d             together with the information on the phase of the location of each point. This phase information, called set-marking, is         not a representative sample from the random set, and hence it cannot be directly used for deducing properties of the random         set. Excursion sets of continuous-parameter Gaussian random fields are applied as a flexible model for the random set. Fully         Bayesian method and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation is adopted for inferring the parameters of the model and estimating         the random set. The performance of the new approach is studied by means of simulation experiments. Further, two forestry data         sets on point patterns of saplings are analysed. The saplings grow in a clear-cut forest area where, before planting and natural         seeding, the soil has been mounded forming a blotched soil structure. The tree densities tend to be different in the tilled         patches and in the area outside the patches. The coordinates of each sapling have been measured and it is known whether this         location is in a patch or outside. This example has been a motivation for the study.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Arthur Charpentier1  | Abder Oulidi2 </authors><title>Beta kernel quantile estimators of heavy-tailed loss distributions      </title><content>In this paper we suggest several nonparametric quantile estimators based on Beta kernel.

The linear predictor contains a smooth component for the trend and the product of a smooth         component (the modulation) and a periodic time series of arbitrary shape (the carrier wave). To model rates, a population         offset is added. Two-dimensional trends and modulation are estimated using a tensor product B-spline basis of moderate dimension.         Further smoothness is ensured using difference penalties on the rows and columns of the tensor product coefficients. The optimal         penalty tuning parameters are chosen based on minimization of a quasi-information criterion. Computationally efficient estimation         is achieved using array regression techniques, avoiding excessively large matrices.

In presence of         some noise component, potential outliers or data with longer-than-normal tails, one way to broaden the model can be provided         by considering t distributions. In this framework, the degrees of freedom can act as a robustness parameter, tuning the heaviness of the tails,         and downweighting the effect of the outliers on the parameters estimation. The aim of this paper is to extend to mixtures         of multivariate elliptical distributions some theoretical results about the likelihood maximization on constrained parameter         spaces. Further, a constrained monotone algorithm implementing maximum likelihood mixture decomposition of multivariate t distributions is proposed, to achieve improved convergence capabilities and robustness.

Information on the dimension reduction subspace is obtained from the variation on group means and, depending on         the estimated mixture model, on the variation on group covariances. The proposed method aims at reducing the dimensionality         by identifying a set of linear combinations, ordered by importance as quantified by the associated eigenvalues, of the original         features which capture most of the cluster structure contained in the data. Observations may then be projected onto such a         reduced subspace, thus providing summary plots which help to visualize the clustering structure. These plots can be particularly         appealing in the case of high-dimensional data and noisy structure. The new constructed variables capture most of the clustering         information available in the data, and they can be further reduced to improve clustering performance. We illustrate the approach         on both simulated and real data sets.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Kwang Woo Ahn1  | Kung-Sik Chan2 </authors><title>Efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo with incomplete multinomial data      </title><content>We propose a block Gibbs sampling scheme for incomplete multinomial data.

By penalizing the sum of &amp;#8467;         2 norms of the blocks of coefficients associated with each covariate across different classification problems, similar sparsity         patterns in all models are encouraged. To take computational advantage of the sparsity of solutions at high regularization         levels, we propose a blockwise path-following scheme that approximately traces the regularization path. As the regularization         coefficient decreases, the algorithm maintains and updates concurrently a growing set of covariates that are simultaneously         active for all problems. We also show how to use random projections to extend this approach to the problem of joint subspace selection, where multiple predictors are found in a common low-dimensional subspace. We present theoretical results showing that this         random projection approach converges to the solution yielded by trace-norm regularization. Finally, we present a variety of         experimental results exploring joint covariate selection and joint subspace selection, comparing the path-following approach         to competing algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy and running time.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Rudolf Beran1 | Lutz DГјmbgen2 </authors><title>Least squares and shrinkage estimation under bimonotonicity constraints      </title><content>In this paper we describe active set type algorithms for minimization of a smooth function under general order constraints,         an important case being functions on the set of bimonotone rГ—s matrices.

We confirm that although, in general, analyses under the correct missing at random and missing completely         at random models are more efficient even for small sample sizes, there are exceptions where they may not improve the results         obtained by ignoring the partially classified data. We show that under the missing not at random (MNAR) model, estimates on         the boundary of the parameter space as well as lack of identifiability of the parameters of saturated models may be associated         with undesirable asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood estimators and likelihood ratio tests; even in standard cases         the bias of the estimators may be low only for very large samples. We also show that the probability of a boundary solution         obtained under the correct MNAR model may be large even for large samples and that, consequently, we may not always conclude         that a MNAR model is misspecified because the estimate is on the boundary of the parameter space.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Merrill W.

If one restricts to a linear technique for         dimension reduction, the remaining issue is the choice of the projection. This choice can be dictated by desire to maximize         certain statistical criteria, including variance, kurtosis, sparseness, and entropy, of the projected data. Motivations for         such criteria comes from past empirical studies of statistics of natural and urban images.

Our approach is to define an         objective function on spaces of orthogonal linear projections&amp;#8212;Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds, and to use gradient techniques         to optimize that function. This construction uses the geometries of these manifolds to perform the optimization.

The permutation can change multiple times between Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations making it difficult to         infer component-specific parameters of the model. Various so-called &amp;#8216;relabelling&amp;#8217; strategies exist with the goal to &amp;#8216;undo&amp;#8217;         the label switches that have occurred to enable estimation of functions that depend on component-specific parameters.

The resulting computational times are very fast compared with procedures         existing in the literature. Such speeding up is obtained by means of a symbolic method arising from the classical umbral calculus.         The classical umbral calculus is a light syntax that involves only elementary rules to managing sequences of numbers or polynomials.         The cornerstone of the procedures here introduced is the connection between cumulants of a random variable and a suitable         compound Poisson random variable. Such a connection holds also for multivariate random variables.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Djalil ChafaГЇ1| 2  | Didier Concordet1| 2 </authors><title>A new method for the estimation of variance matrix with;prescribed zeros in nonlinear mixed effects models      </title><content>We propose a new method for the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) of nonlinear mixed effects models when the variance matrix         of Gaussian random effects has a prescribed pattern of zeros (PPZ).

To create each individual member of an ensemble classifier, PCA is applied to every out-of-bag sample         and the computed coefficients of all principal components are stored, and then the principal components calculated on the         corresponding bootstrap sample are taken as additional elements of the original feature set. A classifier is trained with         the bootstrap sample and some features randomly selected from the new feature set. The final ensemble classifier is constructed         by majority voting of the trained base classifiers. The results obtained by empirical experiments and statistical tests demonstrate         that the proposed method performs better than or as well as several other ensemble methods on some benchmark data sets publicly         available from the UCI repository.

We present a statistical framework in which         the observed images are defined as noisy realizations of a randomly deformed template image. In this framework, we focus on         the problem of the estimation of parameters related to the template and deformations. Our main motivation is the construction         of estimation framework and algorithm which can be applied to short sequences of complex and highly-dimensional images. The         originality of our approach lies in the representations of the template and deformations, which are defined on a common triangulated         domain, adapted to the geometry of the observed images. In this way, we have joint representations of the template and deformations         which are compact and parsimonious. Using such representations, we are able to drastically reduce the number of parameters         in the model. Besides, we adapt to our framework the Stochastic Approximation EM algorithm combined with a Markov Chain Monte         Carlo procedure which was proposed in 2004 by Kuhn and Lavielle. Our implementation of this algorithm takes advantage of some         properties which are specific to our framework. More precisely, we use the Markovian properties of deformations to build an         efficient simulation strategy based on a Metropolis-Hasting-Within-Gibbs sampler. Finally, we present some experiments on         sequences of medical images and synthetic data.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Antonello Maruotti1  | Tobias RydГ©n2</authors><title>A semiparametric approach to hidden Markov models under longitudinal observations      </title><content>We propose a hidden Markov model for longitudinal count data where sources of unobserved heterogeneity arise, making data         overdispersed.

When the data comes from complex or irregular         designs, the use of second generation wavelets in nonparametric regression has proved superior to that of classical wavelets.         However, the construction of a nondecimated second generation wavelet transform is not obvious. In this paper we propose a         new &amp;#8216;nondecimated&amp;#8217; lifting transform, based on the lifting algorithm which removes one coefficient at a time, and explore         its behavior. Our approach also allows for embedding adaptivity in the transform, i.e. wavelet functions can be constructed         such that their smoothness adjusts to the local properties of the signal. We address the problem of nonparametric regression         and propose an (averaged) estimator obtained by using our nondecimated lifting technique teamed with empirical Bayes shrinkage.         Simulations show that our proposed method has higher performance than competing techniques able to work on irregular data.

The proposed method is able to enhance the optimization efficiency and effectiveness as compared to a few alternative strategies.

A theorem about the ergodicity property of the AEMC algorithm is stated         and proven.

A;major challenge in the design of practical MCMC samplers is to achieve efficient convergence and mixing properties.         One way to accelerate convergence and mixing is to adapt the proposal distribution in light of previously sampled points,         thus increasing the probability of acceptance. In this paper, we propose two new adaptive MCMC algorithms based on the Independent         Metropolis&amp;#8211;Hastings algorithm. In the first, we adjust the proposal to minimize an estimate of the cross-entropy between the         target and proposal distributions, using the experience of pre-runs. This approach provides a general technique for deriving         natural adaptive formulae. The second approach uses multiple parallel chains, and involves updating chains individually, then         updating a proposal density by fitting a Bayesian model to the population. An important feature of this approach is that adapting         the proposal does not change the limiting distributions of the chains. Consequently, the adaptive phase of the sampler can         be continued indefinitely. We include results of numerical experiments indicating that the new algorithms compete well with         traditional Metropolis&amp;#8211;Hastings algorithms. We also demonstrate the method for a realistic problem arising in Comparative         Genomics.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Julien Cornebise1 | Г‰ric Moulines1  | Jimmy Olsson2 </authors><title>Adaptive methods for sequential importance sampling with;application to state space models      </title><content>In this paper we discuss new adaptive proposal strategies for sequential Monte Carlo algorithms&amp;#8212;also known as particle filters&amp;#8212;relying         on criteria evaluating the quality of the proposed particles. The choice of the proposal distribution is a major concern and         can dramatically influence the quality of the estimates. Thus, we show how the long-used coefficient of variation (suggested         by Kong et;al. in J. Am. Stat.

As a by-product of this analysis we obtain an auxiliary adjustment multiplier weight type for which         this chi-square distance is minimal. Moreover, we establish an empirical estimate of linear complexity of the Kullback-Leibler         divergence between the involved distributions. Guided by these results, we discuss adaptive designing of the particle filter         proposal distribution and illustrate the methods on a numerical example.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>T.

Bayesian inference on quantile regression or Bayesian quantile regression has attracted         much interest recently. Most of the existing researches in Bayesian quantile regression focus on parametric quantile regression,         though there are discussions on different ways of modeling the model error by a parametric distribution named asymmetric Laplace         distribution or by a nonparametric alternative named scale mixture asymmetric Laplace distribution. This paper discusses Bayesian         inference for nonparametric quantile regression. This general approach fits quantile regression curves using piecewise polynomial         functions with an unknown number of knots at unknown locations, all treated as parameters to be inferred through reversible         jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) of Green (Biometrika 82:711&amp;#8211;732, 1995). Instead of drawing samples from the posterior, we use regression quantiles to create Markov chains for the estimation of         the quantile curves. We also use approximate Bayesian factor in the inference. This method extends the work in automatic Bayesian         mean curve fitting to quantile regression. Numerical results show that this Bayesian quantile smoothing technique is competitive         with quantile regression/smoothing splines of He and Ng (Comput. Stat. 14:315&amp;#8211;337, 1999) and P-splines (penalized splines) of Eilers and de Menezes (Bioinformatics 21(7):1146&amp;#8211;1153, 2005).      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Y.

We         propose the use of a marginal density estimator to construct between-model proposal distributions. This provides both a step         towards black-box simulation for reversible jump samplers, and a tool to examine the utility of common between-model mapping         strategies.

Many complex data sets are collected which do not readily admit standard distributions, and often comprise skew         and kurtotic data. Such data is well-modelled by the very flexibly-shaped distributions of the quantile distribution family,         whose members are defined by the inverse of their cumulative distribution functions and rarely have analytical likelihood         functions defined. Without explicit likelihood functions, Bayesian methodologies such as Gibbs sampling cannot be applied         to parameter estimation for this valuable class of distributions without resorting to numerical inversion. Approximate Bayesian         computation provides an alternative approach requiring only a sampling scheme for the distribution of interest, enabling easier         use of quantile distributions under the Bayesian framework. Parameter estimates for simulated and experimental data are presented.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Richard Gerlach1 | Cathy W. S.

Two main problems are addressed by their method:         modelling nonlinear and nonparametric regression relationship and modelling covariance structure and mean structure simultaneously.         The method gives very good results for curve fitting and prediction but side-steps the problem of heterogeneity. In this paper         we present a new method for modelling functional data with &amp;#8216;spatially&amp;#8217; indexed data, i.e., the heterogeneity is dependent         on factors such as region and individual patient&amp;#8217;s information. For data collected from different sources, we assume that         the data corresponding to each curve (or batch) follows a Gaussian process functional regression model as a lower-level model,         and introduce an allocation model for the latent indicator variables as a higher-level model. This higher-level model is dependent         on the information related to each batch. This method takes advantage of both GPFR and mixture models and therefore improves         the accuracy of predictions. The mixture model has also been used for curve clustering, but focusing on the problem of clustering         functional relationships between response curve and covariates, i.e. the clustering is based on the surface shape of the functional         response against the set of functional covariates.

In a nonlinear mixed effects model example the approach outperformed a block-updater geared to the specific         features of the model.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Paul Fearnhead1 </authors><title>Editorial: Special issue on adaptive Monte Carlo methods      </title><content>Without Abstract</content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>C.

Random variate generation is the basis of stochastic simulation. Applying the ratio-of-uniforms method to generate random         vectors requires the ability to generate points uniformly in a suitable region of the space. Starting from the observation         that, for many multivariate distributions, the multidimensional objective region can be covered by a hyper-ellipsoid more         tightly than by a hyper-rectangle, a new algorithm to generate from multivariate distributions is proposed. Due to the computational         saving it can produce, this method becomes an appealing statistical tool to generate random vectors from families of standard         and nonstandard multivariate distributions. It is particularly interesting to generate from densities known up to a multiplicative         constant, for example, from those arising in Bayesian computation. The proposed method is applied and its efficiency is shown         for some classes of distributions.               </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Hsiuying Wang1| 2 </authors><title>Exact average coverage probabilities and confidence coefficients of;confidence intervals for discrete distributions      </title><content>For a confidence interval (L(X),U(X)) of a parameter &amp;#952; in one-parameter discrete distributions, the coverage probability is a variable function of &amp;#952;.

Since we do not know which point in the parameter space the infimum coverage probability occurs at, the exact confidence         coefficients are unknown. Beside confidence coefficients, evaluation of a confidence intervals can be based on the average         coverage probability. Usually, the exact average probability is also unknown and it was approximated by taking the mean of         the coverage probabilities at some randomly chosen points in the parameter space. In this article, methodologies for computing         the exact average coverage probabilities as well as the exact confidence coefficients of confidence intervals for one-parameter         discrete distributions are proposed. With these methodologies, both exact values can be derived.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Ian L. Dryden1 | Li Bai2| Christopher J.

The         original method, however, requires the inversion of the predictors covariance matrix. In case of collinearity between these         predictors or small sample sizes compared to the dimension, the inversion is not possible and a regularization technique has         to be used. Our approach is based on a Fisher Lecture given by R.D. Cook where it is shown that SIR axes can be interpreted         as solutions of an inverse regression problem. We propose to introduce a Gaussian prior distribution on the unknown parameters         of the inverse regression problem in order to regularize their estimation. We show that some existing SIR regularizations         can enter our framework, which permits a global understanding of these methods. Three new priors are proposed leading to new         regularizations of the SIR method.

Their power is so great that they         can even accommodate situations in which the structure of the statistical model itself is uncertain. However, the analysis         of such trans-dimensional (TD) models is not easy and available software may lack the flexibility required for dealing with the complexities of real         data, often because it does not allow the TD model to be simply part of some bigger model. In this paper we describe a class         of widely applicable TD models that can be represented by a generic graphical model, which may be incorporated into arbitrary         other graphical structures without significantly affecting the mechanism of inference. We also present a decomposition of         the reversible jump algorithm into abstract and problem-specific components, which provides infrastructure for applying the         method to all models in the class considered. These developments represent a first step towards a context-free method for implementing         TD models that will facilitate their use by applied scientists for the practical exploration of model uncertainty. Our approach         makes use of the popular WinBUGS framework as a sampling engine and we illustrate its use via two simple examples in which         model uncertainty is a key feature.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Debasish Roy1 | Geoff Nicholls2 | Colin Fox1</authors><title>Imaging convex quadrilateral inclusions in uniform conductors from electrical boundary measurements      </title><content>We demonstrate simulation-based Bayesian imaging from electrical impedance tomographic data, by summarizing the set of conductance         images which could give rise to the data.

Typically, ST involves introducing an auxiliary variable k taking values in a finite subset of [0,1] and indexing a set of tempered distributions, say &amp;#960;                     k            (&amp;#952;)&amp;#8733;         &amp;#960;(&amp;#952;)            k            . In this case, small values of k encourage better mixing, but samples from &amp;#960; are only obtained when the joint chain for (&amp;#952;,k) reaches k=1. However, the entire chain can be used to estimate expectations under &amp;#960; of functions of interest, provided that importance sampling (IS) weights are calculated. Unfortunately this method, which         we call importance tempering (IT), can disappoint. This is partly because the most immediately obvious implementation is naГЇve         and can lead to high variance estimators. We derive a new optimal method for combining multiple IS estimators and prove that         the resulting estimator has a highly desirable property related to the notion of effective sample size.

To this end, an improved method of auxiliary mixture sampling is proposed. In contrast to previously         proposed samplers the method uses a bounded number of latent variables per observation, independent of the intensity of the         underlying Poisson process in the case of count data, or of the number of experiments in the case of binomial and multinomial         data. The bounded number of latent variables results in a more general error distribution, which is a negative log-Gamma distribution         with arbitrary integer shape parameter. The required approximations of these distributions by Gaussian mixtures have been         computed. Overall, the improvement leads to a substantial increase in efficiency of auxiliary mixture sampling for highly         structured models. The method is illustrated for finite mixtures of generalized linear models and an epidemiological case         study.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>P. Besbeas1  | B.

This is why much research has considered         alternative procedures based on empirical characteristic functions. Two problems then are how many values of the characteristic         function to select, and how to position them. We provide recommendations for both of these topics. We propose an arithmetic         spacing of transform variables, coupled with a recommendation for the location of the variables. It is shown that arithmetic         spacing, which is far simpler to implement, closely approximates optimum spacing. The new methods that result are compared         in simulation studies with existing methods, including maximum-likelihood. The main conclusion is that arithmetic spacing         of the values of the characteristic function, coupled with appropriately limiting the range for these values, improves the         overall performance of the regression-type method of Koutrouvelis, which is the standard procedure for estimating general         stable law parameters.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Willi Sauerbrei1 | Norbert HollГ¤nder1 | Anika Buchholz1</authors><title>Investigation about a screening step in model selection      </title><content>         In many studies a large number of variables is measured and the identification of relevant variables influencing an outcome         is an important task. For variable selection several procedures are available. However, focusing on one model only neglects         that there usually exist other equally appropriate models. Bayesian or frequentist model averaging approaches have been proposed         to improve the development of a predictor. With a larger number of variables (say more than ten variables) the resulting class         of models can be very large. For Bayesian model averaging Occam&amp;#8217;s window is a popular approach to reduce the model space.         As;this approach may not eliminate any variables, a variable screening step was proposed for a;frequentist model averaging         procedure. Based on the results of selected models in bootstrap samples, variables are eliminated before deriving a model         averaging predictor. As a simple alternative screening procedure backward elimination can be used.                                             Through two examples and by means of simulation we investigate some properties of the screening step. In the simulation study               we consider situations with fifteen and 25 variables, respectively, of which seven have an influence on the outcome. With               the screening step most of the uninfluential variables will be eliminated, but also some variables with a weak effect. Variable               screening leads to more applicable models without eliminating models, which are more strongly supported by the data. Furthermore,               we give recommendations for important parameters of the screening step.                           </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Nicolas Chopin1 </authors><title>Jim Albert: Bayesian computation with R         Springer, 2007.

In some cases, especially         when dealing with skewed subpopulations, the estimate of the number of groups can be misleading; if symmetric components are         assumed we need more than one component to describe an asymmetric group. Existing mixture models, based on multivariate normal         distributions and multivariate t distributions, try to fit symmetric distributions, i.e. they fit symmetric clusters. In the present paper, we propose the         use of finite mixtures of the normal inverse Gaussian distribution (and its multivariate extensions). Such finite mixture         models start from a density that allows for skewness and fat tails, generalize the existing models, are tractable and have         desirable properties. We examine both the univariate case, to gain insight, and the multivariate case, which is more useful         in real applications. EM type algorithms are described for fitting the models.

The usual kernel deconvolution estimator         seeks to account for the contamination in the data by employing a modified kernel. In this paper a new approach based on a         weighted kernel density estimator is proposed. Theoretical motivation is provided by the existence of a weight vector that         perfectly counteracts the bias in density estimation without generating an excessive increase in variance. In practice a data         driven method of weight selection is required. Our strategy is to minimize the discrepancy between a standard kernel estimate         from the contaminated data on the one hand, and the convolution of the weighted deconvolution estimate with the measurement         error density on the other hand. We consider a direct implementation of this approach, in which the weights are optimized         subject to sum and non-negativity constraints, and a regularized version in which the objective function includes a ridge-type         penalty. Numerical tests suggest that the weighted kernel estimation can lead to tangible improvements in performance over         the usual kernel deconvolution estimator. Furthermore, weighted kernel estimates are free from the problem of negative estimation         in the tails that can occur when using modified kernels. The weighted kernel approach generalizes to the case of multivariate         deconvolution density estimation in a very straightforward manner.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Juan A.

Nonstationarity         are very common among economic indicators collected over time. They are subsequently summarized into fewer indices for purposes         of monitoring. Due to the simultaneous drifting of the nonstationary time series usually caused by the trend, the first component         averages all the variables without necessarily reducing dimensionality. Sparse principal components analysis can be used,         but attainment of sparsity among the loadings (hence, dimension-reduction is achieved) is influenced by the choice of parameter(s)         (&amp;#955;         1,i            ). Simulated data with more variables than the number of observations and with different patterns of cross-correlations and         autocorrelations were used to illustrate the advantages of sparse principal components analysis over ordinary principal components         analysis.

We provide the range of values of &amp;#955;         1,j             that will ensure convergence of the sparse principal components algorithm and consequently achieve sparsity of component         loadings.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Hee-Seok Oh1 | Donghoh Kim2  | Yongdai Kim1 </authors><title>Robust wavelet shrinkage using robust selection of thresholds      </title><content>This paper considers the problem of selecting a robust threshold of wavelet shrinkage. Previous approaches reported in literature         to handle the presence of outliers mainly focus on developing a robust procedure for a given threshold; this is related to         solving a nontrivial optimization problem. The drawback of this approach is that the selection of a robust threshold, which         is crucial for the resulting fit is ignored. This paper points out that the best fit can be achieved by a robust wavelet shrinkage         with a robust threshold. We propose data-driven selection methods for a robust threshold. These approaches are based on a         coupling of classical wavelet thresholding rules with pseudo data. The concept of pseudo data has influenced the implementation         of the proposed methods, and provides a fast and efficient algorithm. Results from a simulation study and a real example demonstrate         the promising empirical properties of the proposed approaches.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>W.

For this model, we show the equivalence between the trigonometric         method of moments and the maximum likelihood estimators, we give their asymptotic distribution, we provide bias-corrected         estimators of the entropy, the Akaike information criterion and the measured entropy for model selection, and we implement         the ratio-of-uniforms method of simulation.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Eric Renshaw1  | Carlos Comas2</authors><title>Space-time generation of high intensity patterns using growth-interaction processes      </title><content>We describe a novel spatial-temporal algorithm for generating packing structures of disks and spheres, which not only incorporates         all the attractive features of existing algorithms but is also more flexible in defining spatial interactions and other control         parameters. The advantage of this approach lies in the ability of marks to exploit to best advantage the space available to         them by changing their size in response to the interaction pressure of their neighbours. Allowing particles to move in response         to such pressure results in high-intensity packing. Indeed, since particles may temporarily overlap, even under hard-packing         scenarios, they possess a greater potential for rearranging themselves, and thereby creating even higher packing intensities         than exist under other strategies. Non-overlapping pattern structures are achieved simply by allowing the process to &amp;#8216;burn-out&amp;#8217;         at the end of its development period. A variety of different growth-interaction regimes are explored, both symmetric and asymmetric,         and the convergence issues that they raise are examined. We conjecture that not only may this algorithm be easily generalised         to cover a large variety of situations across a wide range of disciplines, but that appropriately targeted generalisations         may well include established packing algorithms as special cases.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Reinhard Furrer1  | Stephan R.

Further, the         data in these problems are often subject to various types of structure and, in particular, spatial dependence. Traditional         model fitting often fails due to the size of the datasets since it is difficult to not only specify but also to compute with         the full covariance matrix describing the spatial dependence. We propose a very general type of mixed model that has a random         spatial component. Recognizing that spatial covariance matrices often exhibit a large number of zero or near-zero entries,         covariance tapering is used to force near-zero entries to zero. Then, taking advantage of the sparse nature of such tapered         covariance matrices, backfitting is used to estimate the fixed and random model parameters. The novelty of the paper is the         combination of the two techniques, tapering and backfitting, to model and analyze spatial datasets several orders of magnitude         larger than those datasets typically analyzed with conventional approaches. Results will be demonstrated with two datasets.         The first consists of regional climate model output that is based on an experiment with two regional and two driver models         arranged in a two-by-two layout. The second is microarray data used to build a profile of differentially expressed genes relating         to cerebral vascular malformations, an important cause of hemorrhagic stroke and seizures.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>C.

We consider three generalisations of         DP. The first is iterated dynamic programming (IDP), where DP is used to recursively solve each of a sequence of one-dimensional         problems in turn, to find a local optimum. A second algorithm is an empirical, stochastic optimiser, which is implemented         by adding progressively less noise to IDP. The final approach replaces DP by a more computationally intensive Forward-Backward         Gibbs Sampler, and uses a simulated annealing cooling schedule. Results are compared with existing pixel-by-pixel methods         of iterated conditional modes (ICM) and simulated annealing in two applications: to restore a synthetic aperture radar (SAR)         image, and to warp a pulsed-field electrophoresis gel into alignment with a reference image.

The drawback is         that inference is not straightforward for these models as the normalisation constant for the likelihood is generally intractable         except for very small observation sets. Variational methods are an emerging tool for Bayesian inference and they have already         been successfully applied in other contexts. Focusing on the particular case of a hidden Potts model with Gaussian noise,         we show how variational Bayesian methods can be applied to hidden Markov random field inference. To tackle the obstacle of         the intractable normalising constant for the likelihood, we explore alternative estimation approaches for incorporation into         the variational Bayes algorithm. We consider a pseudo-likelihood approach as well as the more recent reduced dependence approximation         of the normalisation constant. To illustrate the effectiveness of these approaches we present empirical results from the analysis         of simulated datasets. We also analyse a real dataset and compare results with those of previous analyses as well as those         obtained from the recently developed auxiliary variable MCMC method and the recursive MCMC method. Our results show that the         variational Bayesian analyses can be carried out much faster than the MCMC analyses and produce good estimates of model parameters.         We also found that the reduced dependence approximation of the normalisation constant outperformed the pseudo-likelihood approximation         in our analysis of real and synthetic datasets.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Robert G.

Cattle2 </authors><title>A flexible statistical and efficient computational approach to object location applied to electrical tomography      </title><content>In electrical tomography, multiple measurements of voltage are taken between electrodes on the boundary of a region with the         aim of investigating the electrical conductivity distribution within the region. The relationship between conductivity and         voltage is governed by an elliptic partial differential equation derived from Maxwell&amp;#8217;s equations. Recent statistical approaches,         combining Bayesian methods with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, allow to greater flexibility than classical inverse         solution approaches and require only the calculation of voltages from a conductivity distribution. However, solution of this         forward problem still requires the use of the Finite Difference Method (FDM) or the Finite Element Method (FEM) and many thousands         of forward solutions are needed which strains practical feasibility.                     Many tomographic applications involve locating the perimeter of some homogeneous conductivity objects embedded in a homogeneous               background. It is possible to exploit this type of structure using the Boundary Element Method (BEM) to provide a computationally               efficient alternative forward solution technique. A geometric model is then used to define the region boundary, with priors               on boundary smoothness and on the range of feasible conductivity values. This paper investigates the use of a BEM/MCMC approach               for electrical resistance tomography (ERT) data. The efficiency of the boundary-element method coupled with the flexibility               of the MCMC technique gives a promising new approach to object identification in electrical tomography. Simulated ERT data               are used to illustrate the procedures.            </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Cajo J. F.

In a statistical         context one would not just want the optimum but also its uncertainty. The uncertainty distribution can be obtained by a Bayesian         analysis (after specifying prior and likelihood) using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. This paper integrates the         essential ideas of DE and MCMC, resulting in Differential Evolution Markov Chain (DE-MC). DE-MC is a population MCMC algorithm,         in which multiple chains are run in parallel. DE-MC solves an important problem in MCMC, namely that of choosing an appropriate         scale and orientation for the jumping distribution. In DE-MC the jumps are simply a fixed multiple of the differences of two         random parameter vectors that are currently in the population. The selection process of DE-MC works via the usual Metropolis         ratio which defines the probability with which a proposal is accepted. In tests with known uncertainty distributions, the         efficiency of DE-MC with respect to random walk Metropolis with optimal multivariate Normal jumps ranged from 68% for small         population sizes to 100% for large population sizes and even to 500% for the 97.5% point of a variable from a 50-dimensional         Student distribution. Two Bayesian examples illustrate the potential of DE-MC in practice. DE-MC is shown to facilitate multidimensional         updates in a multi-chain &amp;#8220;Metropolis-within-Gibbs&amp;#8221; sampling approach. The advantage of DE-MC over conventional MCMC are simplicity,         speed of calculation and convergence, even for nearly collinear parameters and multimodal densities.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Matthew A.

These methods require serious modification or preprocessed data to cope with irregularly spaced data. The lifting scheme         is a recent mathematical innovation that obtains a multiscale analysis for irregularly spaced data.                     A key lifting component is the &amp;#8220;predict&amp;#8221; step where a prediction of a data point is made. The residual from the prediction               is stored and can be thought of as a wavelet coefficient. This article exploits the flexibility of lifting by adaptively choosing               the kind of prediction according to a criterion. In this way the smoothness of the underlying &amp;#8216;wavelet&amp;#8217; can be adapted to               the local properties of the function. Multiple observations at a point can readily be handled by lifting through a suitable               choice of prediction. We adapt existing shrinkage rules to work with our adaptive lifting methods.            </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Barry R. Cobb1 | Prakash P.

The approach is developed and illustrated         in the context of the spread of Rhizoctonia solani, a fungal pathogen, in radish but is readily generalized to other scenarios. The particular model considered represents processes         of primary and secondary infection between nearest-neighbour hosts in a lattice, and time-varying susceptibility of the hosts.         Bayesian methods for fitting the model to observations of disease spread through space and time in replicate populations are         developed. These use Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to overcome the problems associated with partial observation of the         process. We also consider how model testing can be achieved by embedding classical methods within the Bayesian analysis. In         particular we show how a residual process, with known sampling distribution, can be defined. Model fit is then examined by         generating samples from the posterior distribution of the residual process, to which a classical test for consistency with         the known distribution is applied, enabling the posterior distribution of the P-value of the test used to be estimated. For the Rhizoctonia-radish system the methods confirm the findings of earlier non-spatial analyses regarding the dynamics of disease transmission         and yield new evidence of environmental heterogeneity in the replicate experiments.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Jukka Cor|er1 | Mats Gyllenberg1 | Timo Koski1| 2</authors><title>Bayesian model learning based on a parallel MCMC strategy      </title><content>We introduce a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for estimation of posterior probabilities over discrete model spaces.         Our learning approach is applicable to families of models for which the marginal likelihood can be analytically calculated,         either exactly or approximately, given any fixed structure. It is argued that for certain model neighborhood structures, the         ordinary reversible Metropolis-Hastings algorithm does not yield an appropriate solution to the estimation problem. Therefore,         we develop an alternative, non-reversible algorithm which can avoid the scaling effect of the neighborhood. To efficiently         explore a model space, a finite number of interacting parallel stochastic processes is utilized. Our interaction scheme enables         exploration of several local neighborhoods of a model space simultaneously, while it prevents the absorption of any particular         process to a relatively inferior state. We illustrate the advantages of our method by an application to a classification model.

This idea has been used in earlier research by Hall and Titterington (1992),         MГјller (1992) and later authors. The use of nonparametric regression allows this to be done without assuming linear or other         parametric forms for the continuous part of the underlying regression function. The focus of the present paper is on assessing         the evidence for the presence of a discontinuity within a regression function through examination of the standardised differences         of &amp;#8216;left&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;right&amp;#8217; estimators at a variety of covariate values.

This approach is based on the use of recursions,         and is related to work on product partition models. The computational complexity of the approach is quadratic in the number         of observations, but an approximate version, which introduces negligible error, and whose computational cost is roughly linear         in the number of observations, is also possible.

In this paper, we show how a simple modification of the proposal mechanism results in faster convergence of the chain and               helps to circumvent the problems described above. This mechanism, which is based on an idea from the field of &amp;#8220;small-world&amp;#8221;               networks, amounts to adding occasional &amp;#8220;wild&amp;#8221; proposals to any local proposal scheme. We demonstrate through both theory and               extensive simulations, that these new proposal distributions can greatly outperform the traditional local proposals when it               comes to exploring complex heterogenous spaces and multi-modal distributions. Our method can easily be applied to most, if               not all, problems involving MCMC and unlike many other remedies which improve the performance of MCMC it preserves the simplicity               of the underlying algorithm.            </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Jan Pol|1  | Marcus Hutter2 </authors><title>MDL convergence speed for Bernoulli sequences      </title><content>The Minimum Description Length principle for online sequence estimation/prediction in a proper learning setup is studied.         If the underlying model class is discrete, then the total expected square loss is a particularly interesting performance measure:         (a) this quantity is finitely bounded, implying convergence with probability one, and (b) it additionally specifies the convergence         speed. For MDL, in general one can only have loss bounds which are finite but exponentially larger than those for Bayes mixtures.         We show that this is even the case if the model class contains only Bernoulli distributions. We derive a new upper bound on         the prediction error for countable Bernoulli classes. This implies a small bound (comparable to the one for Bayes mixtures)         for certain important model classes.

We propose a new approach based on iterative bootstrap         bias correction of the maximum likelihood estimator to accurately approximate the MVUE. Viewing bootstrap iteration as a Markov         process, we develop a computational algorithm for bias correction based on arbitrarily many bootstrap iterations. The algorithm,         when applied parametrically to finite sample spaces, does not involve Monte Carlo simulation. For infinite sample spaces,         a nonparametric version of the algorithm is combined with a preliminary round of Monte Carlo simulation to yield an approximate         MVUE. Both algorithms are computationally more efficient and stable than conventional simulation-based bootstrap iterations.         Examples are given of both finite and infinite sample spaces to illustrate the effectiveness of our new approach.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>T. Bernholt1 | R.

Running medians remove spikes and preserve shifts, but they deteriorate in trend         periods. Modified trimmed mean filters use a robust scale estimate such as the median absolute deviation about the median         (MAD) to select an adaptive amount of trimming. Application of robust regression, particularly of the repeated median, has         been suggested for improving upon the median in trend periods.

The number of mixture components is not specified         in advance and can grow as new data arrive. However, analyses based on the Dirichlet process prior are sensitive to the choice         of the parameters, including an infinite-dimensional distributional parameter G         0. Most previous applications have either fixed G         0 as a member of a parametric family or treated G         0 in a Bayesian fashion, using parametric prior specifications. In contrast, we have developed an adaptive nonparametric method         for constructing smooth estimates of G         0. We combine this method with a technique for estimating &amp;#945;, the other Dirichlet process parameter, that is inspired by an         existing characterization of its maximum-likelihood estimator. Together, these estimation procedures yield a flexible empirical         Bayes treatment of Dirichlet process mixtures. Such a treatment is useful in situations where smooth point estimates of G         0 are of intrinsic interest, or where the structure of G         0 cannot be conveniently modeled with the usual parametric prior families. Analysis of simulated and real-world datasets illustrates         the robustness of this approach.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Jo Eidsvik1  | HГҐKon Tjelmel|1</authors><title>On directional Metropolis&amp;#8211;Hastings algorithms      </title><content>New Metropolis&amp;#8211;Hastings algorithms using directional updates are introduced in this paper. Each iteration of a directional         Metropolis&amp;#8211;Hastings algorithm consists of three steps (i) generate a line by sampling an auxiliary variable, (ii) propose         a new state along the line, and (iii) accept/reject according to the Metropolis&amp;#8211;Hastings acceptance probability. We consider         two classes of directional updates. The first uses a point in                                        n             as auxiliary variable, the second an auxiliary direction vector. The proposed algorithms generalize previous directional         updating schemes since we allow the distribution of the auxiliary variable to depend on properties of the target at the current         state. By letting the proposal distribution along the line depend on the density of the auxiliary variable, we identify proposal         mechanisms that give unit acceptance rate. When we use direction vector as auxiliary variable, we get the advantageous effect         of large moves in the Markov chain and hence the autocorrelation length of the samples is small. We apply the directional         Metropolis&amp;#8211;Hastings algorithms to a Gaussian example, a mixture of Gaussian densities, and a Bayesian model for seismic data.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Nizar Bouguila1 | Djemel Ziou1  | Ernest Monga1 </authors><title>Practical Bayesian estimation of a finite beta mixture through gibbs sampling and its applications      </title><content>This paper deals with a Bayesian analysis of a finite Beta mixture model.

Various approaches have been proposed to extend mixed models for repeated count data to include         dependence on baseline counts. Dependence between baseline counts and individual-specific random effects result in a complex         form of the (conditional) likelihood. An approximate solution can be achieved ignoring this dependence, but this approach         could result in biased parameter estimates and in wrong inferences. We propose a computationally feasible approach to overcome         this problem, leaving the random effect distribution unspecified.

Simulated data are         used to compare a smoothing parameter optimization approach for selection of smoothness and of covariates, a stepwise approach,         a mixed model approach, and a procedure based on boosting techniques. In particular it is investigated how the performance         of procedures is linked to amount of information, type of response, total number of covariates, number of influential covariates,         and extent of non-linearity. Measures for comparison are prediction performance, identification of influential covariates,         and smoothness of fitted functions. One result is that the mixed model approach returns sparse fits with frequently over-smoothed         functions, while the functions are less smooth for the boosting approach and variable selection is less strict. The other         approaches are in between with respect to these measures. The boosting procedure is seen to perform very well when little         information is available and/or when a large number of covariates is to be investigated. It is somewhat surprising that in         scenarios with low information the fitting of a linear model, even with stepwise variable selection, has not much advantage         over the fitting of an additive model when the true underlying structure is linear. In cases with more information the prediction         performance of all procedures is very similar. So, in difficult data situations the boosting approach can be recommended,         in others the procedures can be chosen conditional on the aim of the analysis.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>S.

The mean and variance components of the model may be either parametric or nonparametric, with parsimony achieved through         variable selection and model averaging. A Bayesian approach is used for inference with priors that are data-based so that         estimation can be carried out automatically with minimal input by the user. A Dirichlet process mixture prior is used to model         the error distribution nonparametrically; when there are no regressors in the model, the method reduces to Bayesian density         estimation, and we show that in this case the estimator compares favourably with a well-regarded plug-in density estimator.         We also consider a method for checking the fit of the full model.

Images obtained         with coherent illumination are affected by a noise called speckle, which is inherent to the imaging process. These data have         been statistically modeled by a multiplicative model using the G0 distribution, under which regions with different degrees         of roughness can be characterized by the value of a parameter. We use this information to find boundaries between regions         with different textures. We propose and compare five strategies for boundary detection: three based on the data (maximum discontinuity         on raw data, fractal dimension and maximum likelihood) and two based on estimates of the roughness parameter (maximum discontinuity         and anisotropic smoothed roughness estimates). In order to compare these strategies, a Monte Carlo experience was performed         to assess the accuracy of fitting a curve to a region. The probability of finding the correct edge with less than a specified         error is estimated and used to compare the techniques.

An online clustering algorithm based on mixture models         is presented in the context of a real-time flaw-diagnosis application for pressurized containers which uses data from acoustic         emission signals. The proposed algorithm is a stochastic gradient algorithm derived from the classification version of the         EM algorithm (CEM).

By measuring the mass of clusters         of galaxies on different scales, one can follow the evolution of the mass distribution (MartГ­nez and Saar, Statistics of the Galaxy Distribution, 2002). It can be shown that finding galaxy clusters is equivalent to finding density contour clusters (Hartigan, Clustering Algorithms, 1975): connected components of the level set S                     c            &amp;#8801;{f&amp;gt;c} where f is a probability density function.

In         this setting, implementations of the usual methods of density estimation such as kernel density estimation are problematic.         We propose a method of density estimation for massive datasets that is based upon taking the derivative of a smooth curve         that has been fit through a set of quantile estimates. To achieve this, a low-storage, single-pass, sequential method is proposed         for simultaneous estimation of multiple quantiles for massive datasets that form the basis of this method of density estimation.         For comparison, we also consider a sequential kernel density estimator.

When         the computer model consists of a single statistical model this corresponds to estimation of a function of the model parameters.         This paper is concerned with the case that the computer model implements multiple, individually-estimated statistical sub-models.         This case frequently arises, for example, in models for medical decision making that derive parameter information from multiple         clinical studies. We develop a method for calculating the posterior mean of a function of the parameter vectors of multiple         statistical models that is easy to implement in computer software, has high asymptotic accuracy, and has a computational cost         linear in the total number of model parameters. The formula is then used to derive a general result about posterior estimation         across multiple models. The utility of the results is illustrated by application to clinical software that estimates the risk         of fatal coronary disease in people with diabetes.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>M.

However, in order to move beyond descriptive use an estimate of the underlying         error variance is required as an essential step in constructing interval estimates or comparing models. In the case of a single         covariate, a variety of methods is available for estimating error variance, based on local differencing techniques. These         methods are investigated in the important case of two covariates. An estimator constructed from residuals based on a nonparametric         regression surface using a very small value of smoothing parameter is proposed as the most effective approach. A specific         proposal based on nearest neighbour distances is investigated for choice of the smoothing parameter. Quadratic form techniques         are used to construct confidence intervals and tests based on estimates of error variance. These include comparisons of error         variances from different groups of data and the assessment of the assumption of constant variance across a regression surface.

A range of analytic results are used to ensure convergent computations and to reduce the complexity         of the parameter space.

In the present paper we present a Bayesian estimation approach for the parameters of the bivariate Poisson model         and provide the posterior distributions in closed forms. It is shown that the joint posterior distributions are finite mixtures         of conditionally independent gamma distributions for which their full form can be easily deduced by a recursively updating         scheme. Thus, the need of applying computationally demanding MCMC schemes for Bayesian inference in such models will be removed,         since direct sampling from the posterior will become available, even in cases where the posterior distribution of functions         of the parameters is not available in closed form. In addition, we define a class of prior distributions that possess an interesting         conjugacy property which extends the typical notion of conjugacy, in the sense that both prior and posteriors belong to the         same family of finite mixture models but with different number of components. Extension to certain other models including         multivariate models or models with other marginal distributions are discussed.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>B.

We consider the problem of determining the significance of features such as peaks or valleys         in observed covariate effects both for the case of additive modeling where the main predictor of interest is univariate as         well as the problem of studying the significance of features such as peaks, inclines, ridges and valleys when the main predictor         of interest is geographical location. We work with low rank radial spline smoothers to allow to the handling of sparse designs         and large sample sizes.

In practical implementation of these, the user often has to face specific problems such as seemingly numerical instability         of the integral calculation, choices of grid points, appearance of several local minima or maxima, etc. In this paper we provide         insights into these problems (why and when are they happening?), and give some guidelines of how to deal with them. Such problems         are not new, neither are the ways to deal with them, but it is worthwhile to devote serious considerations to them. For a         transparant and clear discussion of these issues, we focus on a particular statistical problem: nonparametric estimation of         a density from a sample that contains measurement errors. The discussions and guidelines remain valid though in other contexts.         In the density deconvolution setting, a kernel density estimator has been studied in detail in the literature. The estimator         is consistent and fully data-driven procedures have been proposed. When implemented in practice however, the estimator can         turn out to be very inaccurate if no adequate numerical procedures are used. We review the steps leading to the calculation         of the estimator and in selecting parameters of the method, and discuss the various problems encountered in doing so.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Youngjo Lee1 | John A.

Our approach offers a significant extension         to Bayesian Network theory and practice by offering a flexible way of modeling continuous nodes in BNs conditioned on complex         configurations of evidence and intermixed with discrete nodes as both parents and children of continuous nodes.

Such a power curve is nonlinear and bounded, in addition to being nonstationary.         Local linear regression is an appealing nonparametric approach for power curve estimation, for which the model coefficients         can be tracked with recursive Least Squares (LS) methods. This may lead to an inaccurate estimate of the true power curve,         owing to the assumption that a noise component is present on the response variable axis only. Therefore, this assumption is         relaxed here, by describing a local linear regression with orthogonal fit. Local linear coefficients are defined as those         which minimize a weighted Total Least Squares (TLS) criterion. An adaptive estimation method is introduced in order to accommodate         nonstationarity. This has the additional benefit of lowering the computational costs of updating local coefficients every         time new observations become available. The estimation method is based on tracking the left-most eigenvector of the augmented         covariance matrix. A robustification of the estimation method is also proposed. Simulations on semi-artificial datasets (for         which the true power curve is available) underline the properties of the proposed regression and related estimation methods.         An important result is the significantly higher ability of local polynomial regression with orthogonal fit to accurately approximate         the target regression, even though it may hardly be visible when calculating error criteria against corrupted data.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Jouni Kerman1  | Andrew Gelman2 </authors><title>Manipulating and summarizing posterior simulations using random variable objects      </title><content>         Practical Bayesian data analysis involves manipulating and summarizing simulations from the posterior distribution of the         unknown parameters.

We propose a stochastic approximation         expectation-maximization (SAEM) algorithm to maximize the likelihood functions of spatial random effects models.

It is pointed out that the problem can be solved by         determining the Bayes estimator with respect to a least favorable distribution having finite support. In this situation, the         optimal estimator and the least favorable distribution can be determined only by using numerical methods. Some properties         of the minimax estimators and the corresponding least favorable prior distributions are provided depending on the parameters         of the loss function.

The main contribution of this algorithm is that the         closed form expression for the parameter to be updated in each step can be obtained explicitly, without resorting to any numerical         optimization methods. In addition, a new ECME algorithm similar to Liu&amp;#8217;s (Biometrika 81, 633&amp;#8211;648, 1994) one is obtained as a by-product, which turns out to be very close to the simple iteration algorithm proposed by Lawley (Proc.         R. Soc. Edinb. 60, 64&amp;#8211;82, 1940) but our algorithm is guaranteed to increase log-likelihood at every iteration and hence to converge. Both algorithms inherit         the simplicity and stability of EM but their convergence behaviors are much different as revealed in our extensive simulations:         (1);In most situations, ECME and EM perform similarly; (2);CM outperforms EM and ECME substantially in all situations, no         matter assessed by the CPU time or the number of iterations. Especially for the case close to the well known Heywood case, it accelerates EM by factors of around 100 or more. Also, CM is much more insensitive to the choice of starting values         than EM and ECME.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Sourabh Bhattacharya1 | Alan E.

Population-based simulation is important as many challenging sampling problems         in applied statistics cannot be dealt with successfully by conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We summarize         population-based MCMC (Geyer, Computing Science and Statistics: The 23rd Symposium on the Interface, pp.;156&amp;#8211;163, 1991; Liang and Wong, J.;Am. Stat. Assoc. 96, 653&amp;#8211;666, 2001) and sequential Monte Carlo samplers (SMC) (Del Moral, Doucet and Jasra, J.;Roy. Stat. Soc. Ser. B 68, 411&amp;#8211;436, 2006a), providing a comparison of the approaches. We give numerical examples from Bayesian mixture modelling (Richardson and Green,         J.;Roy. Stat. Soc. Ser.;B 59, 731&amp;#8211;792, 1997).               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>David J. H|1| 3| Wojtek J. Krzanowski2  | Martin J. Crowder1</authors><title>Optimal predictive partitioning      </title><content>In many situations, one wishes to group objects into well-defined classes on the basis of one set of descriptor variables,         and then predict the classes of new objects from a different set of variables. For example, a bank may categorise customers         into distinct financial behaviour pattern classes by observing how they have behaved over a period of years, and then seek         to assign new customers to future behaviour classes using information captured when they open an account. Such situations         require the striking of a compromise between the compactness and integrity of the cluster structure, and the accuracy of the         predictive assignment to clusters. We describe two algorithms for achieving such a compromise, discuss some of their features,         and illustrate their performance in a simulation study and in a liver transplant problem.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Leena Choi1 | Brian Caffo1 | Charles Rohde1</authors><title>Optimal sampling times in bioequivalence studies using a simulated annealing algorithm      </title><content>         In pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, blood samples are taken over time on subjects after the administration of a drug to measure         the time-course of the plasma drug concentration. In bioequivalence studies, the trapezoidal rule on the sampled time points         is often used to estimate the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, a quantity of principal interest. This article         investigates the choice of sampling time points to estimate the area under the curve. In particular, we explore the relative         merits of several objective functions, those functions which are minimized with respect to the sampling times to obtain an         optimal study design. Consequently, we propose an objective function which overcomes some of the deficits of existing choices.         We also present a simulated annealing algorithm to perform the minimization. The main benefits of the simulated annealing         algorithm are the ease in which it can handle constraints on the sampling schedules and its ability to accommodate a variety         of models and objective functions. The manuscript presents optimal sampling times for some key examples of true underlying         models.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Jun Yan1 | Mary Kathryn Cowles1| 2| Shaowen Wang3 | Marc P.

This article describes the parallelization         of a reparametrized and marginalized posterior sampling (RAMPS) algorithm, which is carefully designed to generate posterior         samples efficiently. The algorithm is implemented using the Parallel Linear Algebra Package (PLAPACK). The scalability of         the algorithm is investigated via simulation experiments that are implemented using a cluster with 25 processors. The usefulness         of the method is illustrated with an application to sulfur dioxide concentration data from the Air Quality System database         of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Adam M.

Our approach is different and motivated by similar considerations to simulated annealing;         that is we build a sequence of artificial distributions whose support concentrates itself on the set of maximum likelihood         estimates. We sample from these distributions using a sequential Monte Carlo approach. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance         for several applications of the proposed approach.               </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>IrГЁne Gannaz1 </authors><title>Robust estimation and wavelet thresholding in partially linear models      </title><content>         This paper is concerned with a;semiparametric partially linear regression model with unknown regression coefficients, an unknown         nonparametric function for the non-linear component, and unobservable Gaussian distributed random errors.

Some general results on the large sample properties of the estimates of both the parametric and the nonparametric part of         the model are established.

Recently, a mixture of skew normal distributions         has been found to be effective in the treatment of heterogeneous data involving asymmetric behaviors across subclasses. In         this article, we propose a robust mixture framework based on the skew t distribution to efficiently deal with heavy-tailedness, extra skewness and multimodality in a wide range of settings. Statistical         mixture modeling based on normal, Student's t and skew normal distributions can be viewed as special cases of the skew t mixture model. We present analytically simple EM-type algorithms for iteratively computing maximum likelihood estimates.         The proposed methodology is illustrated by analyzing a real data example.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Christian H.

A simple stochastic model is proposed, based on which support and confidence are reasonable estimates         for certain probabilities of the model. Statistical properties of the corresponding estimators, like moments and confidence         intervals, are derived, and items and itemsets are observed for correlations.                                             After a brief review of measures of interest of association rules, with the main focus on interestingness measures motivated               by statistical principles, two new measures are described. These measures, called &amp;#945;- and &amp;#963;-precision, respectively, rely on statistical properties of the estimators discussed before. Experimental results demonstrate               the effectivity of both measures.                           </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Sinjini Mitra1 | Nicole A. Lazar2 | Yanxi Liu3</authors><title>Understanding the role of facial asymmetry in human face identification      </title><content>Face recognition has important applications in forensics (criminal identification) and security (biometric authentication).         The problem of face recognition has been extensively studied in the computer vision community, from a variety of perspectives.         A relatively new development is the use of facial asymmetry in face recognition, and we present here the results of a statistical         investigation of this biometric. We first show how facial asymmetry information can be used to perform three different face         recognition tasks&amp;#8212;human identification (in the presence of expression variations), classification of faces by expression,         and classification of individuals according to sex. Initially, we use a simple classification method, and conduct a feature         analysis which shows the particular facial regions that play the dominant role in achieving these three entirely different         classification goals. We then pursue human identification under expression changes in greater depth, since this is the most         important task from a practical point of view. Two different ways of improving the performance of the simple classifier are         then discussed: (i) feature combinations and (ii) the use of resampling techniques (bagging and random subspaces). With these         modifications, we succeed in obtaining near perfect classification results on a database of 55 individuals, a statistically         significant improvement over the initial results as seen by hypothesis tests of proportions.      </content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Feng Zhang1 | Bani Mallick2 | Zhujun Weng3</authors><title>A Bayesian method for identifying independent sources of non-random spatial patterns      </title><content>A Bayesian blind source separation (BSS) algorithm is proposed in this paper to recover independent sources from observed         multivariate spatial patterns. As a widely used mechanism, Gaussian mixture model is adopted to represent the sources for         statistical description and machine learning. In the context of linear latent variable BSS model, some conjugate priors are         incorporated into the hyperparameters estimation of mixing matrix. The proposed algorithm then approximates the full posteriors         over model structure and source parameters in an analytical manner based on variational Bayesian treatment. Experimental studies         demonstrate that this Bayesian source separation algorithm is appropriate for systematic spatial pattern analysis by modeling         arbitrary sources and identify their effects on high dimensional measurement data. The identified patterns will serve as diagnosis         aids for gaining insight into the nature of physical process for the potential use of statistical quality control.      </content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Peter Neal1  | Gareth Roberts2 </authors><title>A case study in non-centering for data augmentation: Stochastic epidemics      </title><content>In this paper, we introduce non-centered and partially non-centered MCMC algorithms for stochastic epidemic models. Centered         algorithms previously considered in the literature perform adequately well for small data sets. However, due to the high dependence         inherent in the models between the missing data and the parameters, the performance of the centered algorithms gets appreciably         worse when larger data sets are considered. Therefore non-centered and partially non-centered algorithms are introduced and         are shown to out perform the existing centered algorithms.      </content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Salvatore Ingrassia1</authors><title>A comparison between the simulated annealing and the EM algorithms in normal mixture decompositions</title><content>We compare the performances of the simulated annealing and the EM algorithms in problems of decomposition of normal mixtures according to the likelihood approach. In this case the likelihood function has multiple maxima and singularities, and we consider a suitable reformulation of the problem which yields an optimization problem having a global solution and at least a smaller number of spurious maxima. The results are compared considering some distance measures between the estimated distributions and the true ones. No overwhelming superiority of either method has been demonstrated, though in one of our cases simulated annealing achieved better results.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Joseph G. Hirschberg1</authors><title>A computationally efficient method for bootstrapping systems of demand equations: A comparison to traditional techniques</title><content>The solution to a Liapunov matrix equation (LME) has been proposed to estimate the parameters of the demand equations derived from the Translog, the Almost Ideal Demand System and the Rotterdam demand models. When compared to traditional scemingly unrelated regression (SUR) methods the LME approach saves both computer time and space, and it provides parameter estimates that are less likely to suffer from round-off error. However, the LME method is difficult to implement without the use of specially written computer programs and, unlike traditional SUR methods, it does not automatically provide an estimate of the covariance of the parameters. This paper solves these two problems, the first by providing a simplified solution to the Liapunov matrix equation which can be written in a few lines of code in computer languages such as SAS PROC MATRIX/IMLTM or GAUSSTM; the second, by bootstrapping the parameter covariance matrix.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Katsuhiko Tsujino1 | Shogo Nishida1</authors><title>A knowledge acquisition inductive system driven by empirical interpretation of derived results</title><content>This paper describes the design philosophy of and current issues concerning a knowledge acquisition system namedkaiser. This system is an intelligent workbench for construction of knowledge bases for classification tasks by domain experts themselves. It first learns classification knowledge inductively from the examples given by a human expert, then analyzes the result and process based on abstract domain knowledge which is also given by the expert. Based on this analysis, it asks sophisticated questions for acquiring new knowledge. The queries stimulate the human expert and help him to revise the learned results, control the learning process and prepare new examples and domain knowledge. Viewed from an AI aspect, it aims at integrating similarity-based inductive learning and explanation-based deductive reasoning by guiding inductive inference with theoretical and/or heuristic knowledge about the domain. This interactive induce-evaluate-ask cycle produces a rational interview which promotes incremental acquisition of domain knowledge as well as efficient induction of operational and reasonable knowledge proved by the domain knowledge.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>A. C. Atkinson1</authors><title>A segmented algorithm for simulated annealing</title><content>The properties of a parameterized form of generalized simulated annealing for function minimization are investigated by studying the properties of repeated minimizations from random starting points. This leads to the comparison of distributions of function values and of numbers of function evaluations. Parameter values which yield searches repeatedly terminating close to the global minimum may require unacceptably many function evaluations. If computational resources are a constraint, the total number of function evaluations may be limited. A sensible strategy is then to restart at a random point any search which terminates, until the total allowable number of function evaluations has been exhausted. The response is now the minimum of the function values obtained. This strategy yields a surprisingly stable solution for the parameter values of the simulated annealing algorithm. The algorithm can be further improved by segmentation in which each search is limited to a maximum number of evaluations, perhaps no more than a fifth of the total available. The main tool for interpreting the distributions of function values is the boxplot. The application is to the optimum design of experiments.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Judea Pearl1 | Thomas S.

The average run length (ARL) became the most popular performance measure for schemes with this objective. When monitoring         the mean of independent and normally distributed observations the ARL can be determined with high precision. Nowadays, EWMA         control charts are also used for monitoring the variance. Charts based on the sample variance S2 are an appropriate choice. The usage of ARL evaluation techniques known from mean monitoring charts, however, is difficult.         The most accurate method&amp;#8212;solving a Fredholm integral equation with the NystrГ¶m method&amp;#8212;fails due to an improper kernel in the         case of chi-squared distributions.

We see that collocation leads to higher accuracy than currently established methods.      </title><content/></document></documents>
