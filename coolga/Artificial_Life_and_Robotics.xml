The technique is based on measurements using two digital still cameras. We carried out several experiments using this technique.

We have developed a multimodal neural network (MNN) to predict protein secondary structure. The MNN is composed of several subclassifiers for single-state predictions using neural networks and a decision neural network (DNN). Each subclassifier employs a number of subnetworks to predict the single-state of the secondary structure individually and produces the final results by majority decision. The DNN uses a three-layer neural network to produce the final overall prediction from the outputs of the single-state predictions. The MNN gives an overall accuracy of 71.1% with corresponding Matthews correlation coefficients of C                H = 0.62 and C                E = 0.53. The prediction test is based on a database of 126 nonhomologous protein sequences.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Masanori Sugisaka1| 2 | Kouta Imamura1| Kouji Tokuda1 | Maoki Masuda1</authors><title>A new artificial life body: biologically inspired dynamic bipedal humanoid robots</title><content>Recently, a biologically inspired, bipedal, dynamic, humanoid robot was developed at the Artificial Life and Robotics Laboratory of Oita University. This bipedal humanoid robot is able to walk dynamically and to go up and down stairs. The central pattern generator developed produces various types of walking pattern. This robot has a pair of small CMOS color CCD cameras, a speaker, and a microphone in the head part, and will have a GPS, a portable telephone, and other sensors in the body part, so that the integration of locomotion and behavior to achieve specific demonstrations will be realized. This project develops dynamic mobility and the ability for autonomous recognition and navigation using the biological central nervous system, the brain system, and the real-time control system. Also, the design principles that demonstrate the dynamic interaction between neural and mechanical controls will be clarified. In Phase I, the platform of a small, bipedal, humanoid robot is used to develop autonomous locomotion and autonomous sensing and navigation. In Phase II of the project, an iteration on the platform design for human-size, bipedal, humanoid robots will be performed for operational testing. The development of bipedal humanoid robots that capture biological systems with unique principles and practices could dramatically increase their performance in tasks for national security needs.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Ali Ahmadi1 | Sigeru Omatu1| Toshihisa Kosaka2 | Toru Fujinaka1</authors><title>A reliable method for classification of bank notes using artificial neural networks</title><content>We present a method based on principal component analysis (PCA) for increasing the reliability of bank note recognition machines. The system is intended for classifying any kind of currency, but in this paper we examine only US dollars (six different bill types). The data was acquired through an advanced line sensor, and after preprocessing, the PCA algorithm was used to extract the main features of data and to reduce the data size. A linear vector quantization (LVQ) network was applied as the main classifier of the system. By defining a new method for validating the reliability, we evaluated the reliability of the system for 1200 test samples. The results show that the reliability is increased up to 95% when the number of PCA components as well as the number of LVQ codebook vectors are taken properly. In order to compare the results of classification, we also applied hidden Markov models (HMMs) as an alternative classifier.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Yoosook Lee1| Jason Riggle2| Travis C.

We propose that this view clarifies many of the difficulties framing issues of collaboration and self-organization. Additionally, we demonstrate simple classification systems that can provide the first step in grounding real-world data and provide general schema for constructing other such systems. The first system classifies auditory input from frog calls and is presented as a model of grounding objects.

The system is based on the reference model adaptive control method. It works adaptively according to the difference between individuals, and chronic change of the patients physiological state, and changes in the environmental conditions. Using the human thermal system of the Stolwijk-Hardy model, the brain temperature is dynamically related to the ambient temperature of the head, trunk, and extremities and their metabolic heat production. The dynamic characteristics of brain temperature under various physical conditions, as examined by simulation experiments, provide improved understanding of clinical brain cooling treatment, which simultaneously give good evidence for the validity of the model. The brain temperature is adaptively controlled in accordance with the appropriate physiological state suggested by various clinical experiences. This kind of adaptive control system is useful for the practical implementation of automatic hypothermia control in seriously injured or inflamed brain.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Hiroaki Tanaka1| 2| 3  | Kazuyuki Aihara1| 2| 4</authors><title>Analysis of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations with noise: the effects of noise on chaotic neurodynamics</title><content>The chaotic behavior of Hodgkin-Huxley equations modulated by noise was studied by power spectra, correlation exponents, and information entropies by changing noise amplitude and components. The power spectra of the membrane potential calculated by the equations showed two major peaks at 105 and 115Hz. The noise component of compressing dynamics (CDN) enhanced the amplitude of the 105Hz component and also increased its frequency. The correlation exponent of the correlation integral, which was calculated with a scale size below the noise amplitude, was almost the same as the degree of freedom of the system (=4) when CDN was applied. Contrary to this, the noise component of extending dynamics (EDN) increased the exponent only up to 2.5&amp;#x2013;3.0. The information entropy shows that both CDN and EDN produced noise-induced order (NIO). The effect of EDN was slightly larger than that of CDN. When comparing the effects of noise imposed on the variables of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, V and m appeared to be related to CDN, while h and n appeared to be related to EDN. These results suggest that the fluctuations induced by EDN were restricted within some parts of submanifolds comprising the strange attractor, while those induced by CDN shook the orbit away from the submanifolds. This shake-out mechanism may have a significant role on real neurodynamics.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Masanori Sugisaka1| Fengzhi Dai2  | Hidenori Kimura3</authors><title>Application of a neuro-fuzzy system to control a mobile vehicle</title><content>We describe a fuzzy control based on a neural network, which is obtained by merging the advantages of a neural network, a competitive algorithm, and fuzzy control. This adaptive fuzzy control system can deal with data sampled by a neural network. From such training data, it can produce more reasonable fuzzy rules by a competitive (clustering) algorithm, and finally control the object by the optimized fuzzy rules. This is not a simple combination of the three methods, but a merger into one control system. Some experiments and future considerations are also given.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Ayaki Kiyuna1 | Hiroshi Kinjo1| Kunihiko Nakazono1 | Tetsuhiko Yamamoto1</authors><title>Backward control of multitrailer systems using neurocontrollers evolved by a genetic algorithm</title><content>We propose a design method for neurocontrollers (NCs) evolved by a genetic algorithm (GA) for the control of the backward movement of multitrailer truck systems. The difficulty of controlling backward movement increases with the number of connected trailers. In order to search for the best NCs for multitrailer systems, we propose a step-up training method. The step-up training sequence is as follows. First, the initial NCs, that are set to random values, are trained for an easy control object. Second, the set of NCs is trained for more difficult control objects. In this study, the initial NCs are first trained for a two-trailer connected truck system, then the NCs are trained for a three-trailer system, and finally the NCs are trained for a four-trailer system. The step-up training method is able to advance to NCs which can successfully control multitrailer systems. Simulation results show that the step-up training method is useful for multitrailer systems.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Hideki Kozima1 | Cocoro Nakagawa1 | Hiroyuki Yano1</authors><title>Can a robot empathize with people?</title><content>This article explores a robotogenetic model of empathetic understanding of another mind as one of the capabilities required in human&amp;#x2013;robot social interactions. The term robotogenetic means that we implement a possible ontogeny (i.e., developmental process) of the social capability onto a robotic embodiment with a certain phylogenetic background (i.e., innate prerequisites). First, we look into infants development of social and communicative skills, especially of empathetic understanding of others. We then consider two fundamental abilities, namely eye-contact and joint attention, as the prerequisites for this cognitive development. Then in psychological experiments using robots that are capable of eye-contact and joint attention, we observe how people, especially infants and children, attribute mental states to the robots. Based on these investigations, we consider a possible mechanism of empathy which is based on the spatiotemporal coordination of attention and bodily movement between the self and another.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Hideaki Suzuki1  | Hidefumi Sawai2</authors><title>Chemical genetic algorithms &amp;#x2013; a coevolutionary method to optimize code translation in GAs</title><content>We propose a chemical genetic algorithm (CGA) in which several types of molecule react with each other in a cell. A cell includes a binary string (DNA) and smaller molecules, and the fundamental mapping from binary substrings on DNA (genotype) to real values for the output parameters (phenotype) is specified by a set of molecules called aminoacyl-tRNAs. Through evolutionary modification of the genetic information on the DNA, the codes on the DNA and the genotype-to-phenotype translation coevolve, which allows optimization of the code translation during evolution. The CGA is applied to several benchmark problems, and its effectiveness is demonstrated in comparison with a simple genetic algorithm (SGA).</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Yoshio Fukuda1| Motohiro Tanaka1| Atsushi Yoshimochi1 | Takakazu Ishimatsu1 </authors><title>Communication device to use an acceleration sensor for the seriously disabled</title><content>A communication device is proposed for use as an acceleration sensor for the seriously disabled. This device is mainly for disabled people with problems such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or a cerebral infarction, who have communication difficulties because of a physical disability. A feature of this device is that the sensor can readily be mounted on the users body. The mounting of the sensor on the body is easy, unlike a conventional touch sensor. Another feature is that even though the physical disability of the user is serious, this device can be operated by slight movements of a part of the body. In addition, we have developed an adaptive word processing software for seriously disabled people. A feature of this software is that the arrangement and size of the buttons and the window on the display can be optimized based on the users physical ability. In a field test, we confirmed that our communication device incorporating this adaptive word processing software was applicable to disabled people.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Changmok Oh1 | Min-Soeng Kim1 | Ju-Jang Lee1</authors><title>Control of a nonholonomic mobile robot using an RBF network</title><content>This article deals with handling unknown factors, such as external disturbance and unknown dynamics, for mobile robot control. We propose a radial-basis function (RBF) network-based controller to compensate for these. The stability of the proposed controller is proven using the Lyapunov function. To show the effectiveness of the proposed controller, several simulation results are presented. Through the simulations, we show that the proposed controller can overcome the modelling uncertainty and the disturbances. The proposed RBF controller also outperforms previous work from the viewpoint of computation time, which is a crucial fact for real-time applications.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Lanka Udawatta1 | Keigo Watanabe1| Kiyotaka Izumi1 | Kazuo Kiguchi1</authors><title>Control of three degrees-of-freedom underactuated manipulator using fuzzy based switching</title><content>A novel concept for designing a fuzzy logic-based switching controller to control underactuated manipulators is presented. The proposed controller employs elemental controllers, which are designed in advance. Parameters of both antecedent and consequent parts of a fuzzy indexer are optimized by using evolutionary computation. Design parameters of the fuzzy indexer are encoded into chromosomes, i.e., the shapes of the Gaussian membership functions and corresponding switching laws of the consequent part are evolved to minimize the angular position errors. Then, these trained fuzzy rules can be brought into the online operation of underactuated manipulators. Simulation results show that the new methodology is effective in designing controllers for underactuated robot manipulators.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Ivan T. Tanev1 </authors><title>DOM/XML-based portable genetic representation of the morphology, behavior and communication abilities of evolvable agents</title><content>This article presents the results of our work on the role of genetic representation in facilitating the quick design of efficiently running offline learning via genetic programming (GP). An approach using the widely adopted document object model/extensible mark-up language (DOM/XML) standard for the representation of genetic programs, and off-the-shelf DOM-parsers with built-in application programming interface (API) for manipulating them is proposed. This approach means a significant reduction in time in the usually slow software engineering of GP, and offers a generic way to facilitate the reduction of computational effort by limiting the search space of genetic programming by handling only semantically correct genetic programs. The concept is accomplished through strongly typed genetic programming (STGP), in which the use of W3C-recommended standard XML schema is proposed as a generic way to represent and impose the grammar rules in STGP. The ideas laid in the foundation of the proposed approach are verified by the implementation of GP in the evolving social behavior of agents in predator&amp;#x2013;prey pursuit problems.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Hyeon Bae1 | Sungshin Kim1 | Man Hyung Lee2</authors><title>Extraction of quantitative and image information from flame images of steam boiler burners</title><content>Several types of detector, such as ultraviolet, infrared, visible light, differential pressure, flame rod, and others, are employed to detect fire flame in power generation plants.

Nowadays, the image-processing technique is broadly applied in industrial fields. The neural network model has strong adaptability and learning capability, and is suitable for pattern classification.

Intelligent reasoning, task-oriented behaviors, human&amp;#x2013;robot interfaces, and communications add more tasks to be solved. This naturally leads to a complex hierarchical control system where various tasks have to be processed concurrently. Many low-level tasks can be handled by a robots onboard (host) computer. However, other tasks, such as speech recognition or vision processing, are too computationally intensive for one computer to process. In this case, it is better to consider a distributed design for the control system in networked environments. In order to achieve maximum use of the distributed environment, it is important to design and implement the distributed system and its communication mechanisms in an effective and flexible way. This article describes our approach to designing and implementing a distributed control system for an intelligent mobile robot. We present our implementation of such a distributed control system for a prototype mobile robot. We focus our discussion on the system architecture, distributed communication mechanisms, and distributed robot control.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Jiwu Wang1 | Hidenori Kimura2| 3 | Masanori Sugisaka1| 2</authors><title>Intelligent control for the vision-based indoor navigation of an A-life mobile robot</title><content>Realizing steady and reliable navigation is a prerequisite for a mobile robot, but this facility is often weakened by an unavoidable slip or some irreparable drift errors of sensors in long-distance navigation. Although perceptual landmarks were solutions to such problems, it is impossible not to miss landmarks occasionally at some specific spots when the robot moves at different speeds, especially at higher speeds. If the landmarks are put at random intervals, or if the illumination conditions are not good, the landmarks will be easier to miss. In order to detect and extract artificial landmarks robustly under multiple illumination conditions, some low-level but robust image processing techniques were implemented. The moving speed and self-location were controlled by the visual servo control method. In cases where a robot suddenly misses some specific landmarks when it is moving, it will find them again in a short time based on its intelligence and the inertia of the previous search motion. These methods were verified by the reliable vision-based indoor navigation of an A-life mobile robot.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Toshio Fukuda1 | Yasuhisa Hasegawa2 | Hideki Kajima1</authors><title>Intelligent robots as artificial living creatures</title><content>This article introduces a multi locomotion robot, MLR III, which has multiple locomotion types, i.e., not only brachiating but also walking. Conventionally we have studied dexterous locomotion robots and their controller design. One is a simplified two-link robot, Brachiator II. This is an example of an underactuated system in which a robot mechanism has more degrees of freedom than actuators. The desired motions are encoded as the output of a target dynamical system inspired by the pendulum-link motion of an apes brachiation. The other is a monkey-type robot, Brachiator III. Brachiator III achieves a dexterous motion using redundant degrees of freedom. The motion is generated in an empirical learning process on an intelligent structure, on which the learning algorithm coordinates some primitive motions to generate the desired motion. MLR III is an extended locomotion robot that has multiple types of locomotions: brachiation, bipedal walking, and quadrupedal walking, similar to a monkey or gorilla. This article introduces the mechanism and controller design for brachiating motion.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Eun Young Song1  | Ju-Jang Lee2</authors><title>Moving object detection using region tracking</title><content>For many vision-based systems, it is important to detect a moving object automatically. The region-based motion estimation method is popular for automatic moving object detection. The region-based method has several advantages in that it is robust to noise and variations in illumination. However, there is a critical problem in that there exists an occlusion problem which is caused by the movement of the object. The occlusion problem results in an incorrect motion estimation and faulty detection of moving objects. When there are occlusion regions, the motion vector is not correctly estimated. That is, a stationary background in the occluded region can be classified as a moving object.In order to overcome this occlusion problem, a new occlusion detection algorithm is proposed. The proposed occlusion detection algorithm is motivated by the assumption that the distribution of the error histogram of the occlusion region is different from that of the nonocclusion region. The proposed algorithm uses the mean and variance values to decide whether an occlusion has occurred in the region. Therefore, the proposed occlusion detection and motion estimation scheme detects the moving regions and estimates the new motion vector, while avoiding misdetection caused by the occlusion problem. The experimental results for several video sequences demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach to the occlusion problem.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Shunji Moromugi1 | Yasuhiro Koujina2| Seigo Ariki1| Akira Okamoto1| Takayuki Tanaka3| Maria Q.

A current research topic in distributed systems is self-monitoring to identify corrupted intrusion detection systems. One way of self-monitoring is for intrusion detection systems to check each other. As we describe herein, this can be done by mobile agents using an immunity-based diagnostic method modeled on idiotypic network theory. In simulations, the credibility of normal intrusion detection systems remained near 1, while it fell to about 0 for corrupted intrusion detection systems, thus enabling identification of the latter. We also confirmed what effects some parameters have on the diagnostic capability.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>KwanWoo Kim1 | Genji Yamazaki1| Lin Lin2 | Mitsuo Gen2</authors><title>Network-based hybrid genetic algorithm for scheduling in FMS environments</title><content>Scheduling in flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) must take account of the shorter lead-time, the multiprocessing environment, the flexibility of alternative workstations with different processing times, and the dynamically changing states. The best scheduling approach, as described here, is to minimize makespan t                M, total flow time t                F, and total tardiness penalty p                T. However, in the case of manufacturing system problems, it is difficult for those with traditional optimization techniques to cope with this. This article presents a new flow network-based hybrid genetic algorithm (hGA) approach for generating static schedules in a FMS environment. The proposed method is combined with the neighborhood search technique in a mutation operation to improve the solution of the FMS problem, and to enhance the performance of the genetic search process. We update the change in swap mutation and the local search-based mutation ration. Numerical experiments show that the proposed flow network-based hGA is both effective and efficient for FMS problems.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Sherwin A.

In their work, each of the expectation elements is linearly acquired such that the expectation gives only the dominant information of the recent past. This handicap could become a serious problem when the perception process is applied to real physical systems. Such an approach has no capability to sense the trend or the dynamics in the information. Here, we introduce an extension of the perception control process by using a radial basis function feedforward neural network to learn the trend and the dynamics in the information queue.

We extracted the spectrum average and the frequency variation from the acoustic data of operating transmission devices. Then we used the GA with FP to select the significant frequencies and made a quality evaluation rule to classify the good and defective products. For the frequency variation, we used the learning vector quantization (LVQ) to evaluate the quality of transmission devices. Using either the spectrum average or frequency variation alone might lead to incorrect results. However, we can ensure the final quality of transmission devices by using both frequency variation and spectrum average. The experimental results showed that the proposed method can perform the quality evaluation of transmission devices successfully and has better performance than the results obtained by the conventional GA with binary representation.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Koji Kurata1  | Naoki Oshiro1</authors><title>Separating visual information into position and direction by SOM</title><content>A model is proposed to self-organize a map for the visual recognition of position and direction by a robot moving autonomously in a room. The robot is assumed to have visual sensors. The model is based on Kohonens self-organizing map (SOM), which was proposed as a model of self-organization of the cortex. An ordinary SOM consists of a two-dimensional array of neuron-like feature detector units. In our model, however, units are arranged in a three-dimensional array, and a periodic boundary condition is assumed in one dimension. Also, some new learning rules are added. Our model is shown by a computer simulation to form a map which can extract from the visual input two factors of information separately, i.e., the position and direction of the robot. This is an example of so-called two-factor problems. In our algorithm, the difference in the topology of the information is used to separate two factors of information.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Takanori Yokoyama1 | Ken Sugawara1 | Toshinori Watanabe1</authors><title>Similarity-based image retrieval system using partitioned iterated function system codes</title><content>We propose a new image retrieval system using partitioned iterated function system (PIFS) codes.

After its introduction, this approach was further developed and led to many applications. All of these approaches are based on Pareto ranking and use the fitness sharing function to keep diversity. On the other hand, the scheme for solving MOPs presented by Nash introduced the notion of Nash equilibrium and aimed at solving MOPs that originated from evolutionary game theory and economics. Since the concept of Nash Equilibrium was introduced, game theorists have attempted to formalize aspects of the evolutionary equilibrium. Nash genetic algorithm (Nash GA) is the idea to bring together genetic algorithms and Nash strategy. The aim of this algorithm is to find the Nash equilibrium through the genetic process. Another central achievement of evolutionary game theory is the introduction of a method by which agents can play optimal strategies in the absence of rationality. Through the process of Darwinian selection, a population of agents can evolve to an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS). In this article, we find the ESS as a solution of MOPs using a coevolutionary algorithm based on evolutionary game theory. By applying newly designed coevolutionary algorithms to several MOPs, we can confirm that evolutionary game theory can be embodied by the coevolutionary algorithm and this coevolutionary algorithm can find optimal equilibrium points as solutions for an MOP. We also show the optimization performance of the co-evolutionary algorithm based on evolutionary game theory by applying this model to several MOPs and comparing the solutions with those of previous evolutionary optimization models.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Tae-Seok Jin1 | Kwon-Soon Lee2 | Jang-Myung Lee3</authors><title>Space and time sensor fusion using an active camera for mobile robot navigation</title><content>We propose a sensor-fusion technique where the data sets for previous moments are properly transformed and fused into the current data sets to allow accurate measurements, such as the distance to an obstacle or the location of the service robot itself. In conventional fusion schemes, measurements are dependent on the current data sets. As a result, more sensors are required to measure a certain physical parameter or to improve the accuracy of a measurement. However, in this approach, instead of adding more sensors to the system, the temporal sequences of the data sets are stored and utilized to improve the measurements. The theoretical basis is illustrated by examples, and the effectiveness is proved through simulations.

However, their performance in various environmental conditions is not as good as desired. This disadvantage can be overcome by adjusting works or constructing adaptive controllers, although these methods are complex and not easy. This article presents a new method for constructing a ship autopilot based on the combination of fuzzy logic control (FLC) and linear control theory (PID control). The new ship autopilot has the advantages of both the PID and FLC control methodologies: ease of construction, and optimal control laws can be established based on ship master knowledge. Therefore, the new ship autopilot can be well adapted with parameter variations and strong environment effects. Simulation using MATLAB software for a ship with real parameters showed high effectiveness of the fuzzy PID autopilot in course-keeping and course-changing maneuvers in comparison with the ordinary PID ship autopilots.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Universal constructor to build a Tierran machine structure</authors><title>In constructing an artificial life system with a high potential for evolution, one of the elements that we should design most carefully is the machine structure, i.e., the architecture of the system controlling the operations of a digital creature. This article proposes an approach to modify the machine structure of Tierra in order to obtain higher evolvability. The structure of the Tierran digital creature that we propose is stimulated by the self-reproducing model proposed by von Neumann, which allows self-reproduction in a simple architecture. A verification of a digital creatures structure was carried out through computer simulation. As a result, the capabilities of self-reproduction and parasitism were demonstrated.</title></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Takashi Kuremoto1 | Tomonori Ohta1| Kunikazu Kobayashi1 | Masanao Obayashi1</authors><title>A dynamic associative memory system by adopting an amygdala model      </title><content>Although several kinds of computational associative memory models and emotion models have been proposed since the last century,         the interaction between memory and emotion is almost always neglected in these conventional models.

It is used         to collect information from tissue and cell samples regarding gene expression differences that could be useful for cancer         classification. However, the urgent problems in the use of gene expression data are the availability of a huge number of genes         relative to the small number of available samples, and the fact that many of the genes are not relevant to the classification.         It has been shown that selecting a small subset of genes can lead to improved accuracy in the classification. Hence, this         paper proposes a solution to the problems by using a multiobjective strategy in a genetic algorithm. This approach was tried         on two benchmark gene expression data sets. It obtained encouraging results on those data sets as compared with an approach         that used a single-objective strategy in a genetic algorithm.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Nobuya Takahashi1 | Michio Kono1| Tatsuo Suzuki2 | Osamu Sato1</authors><title>A numerical solution of the stochastic discrete algebraic Riccati equation      </title><content>This article proposes two algorithms for solving a stochastic discrete algebraic Riccati equation which arises in a stochastic         optimal control problem for a discrete-time system.

Some remarkable characteristics of the SMC method are good robustness and stability for deviations from control conditions.         On the other hand, RL may be applicable to complex systems that are difficult to model. However, applying reinforcement learning         to a real system has a serious problem, i.e., many trials are required for learning. We intend to develop a new control method         with good characteristics for both these methods. To realize it, we employ the actor-critic method, a kind of RL, to unite         with the SMC. We are able to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method through a computer simulation of inverted         pendulum control without the use of inverted pendulum dynamics. In particular, it is shown that the proposed method enables         the RL to learn in fewer trials than the reinforcement learning method.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Mai Umeki1 | Yasuhiro Suzuki1 </authors><title>A simple method for simulating biochemical reaction networks      </title><content>We propose a simple method of simulating chemical reaction networks by using a multiset rewriting system: abstract rewriting         system on multisets (ARMS).

Despite these computational difficulties, humans robustly perform accurate visual processing. One of         the most important keys in human visual processing is attention control.                     In this article, we first suggest that the particle filter (PF) is a major candidate for a model of multifocal visual attention.               PF is a method which approximates intractable integrations in incremental Bayesian computation by means of stochastic sampling.               One of the major drawbacks of PFs is a trade-off between computational costs and tracking performance; a large number of particles               are required for accurate and robust estimations of state variables, which is time-consuming. This study proposes a computational               model for multifocal visual attention which deals with the cost-performance trade-off with a restricted computing resource               (the number of particles). Simulation experiments of tracking two targets with only tens of particles demonstrate the feasibility               of the model.            </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Gustavo Olague1 | Cynthia B.

The algorithm presented here incorporates two different epidemic automata along a single execution of the         infection algorithm. The new algorithm attempts to provide a general behavior of guessing the best correspondence between         a pair of images. Our aim is to provide a new strategy inspired by evolutionary computation, which combines the behaviors         of both automata into a single correspondence problem. The new algorithm will decide which automata will be used based on         the transmission of information and mutation, as well as the attributes, texture, and geometry, of the input images. This         article gives details about how the rules used in the infection algorithm are coded.

In a large number of localization schemes, the absolute-position estimation method, which relies on navigation         beacons or landmarks, has been widely used as it has the advantages of being economical and accurate. However, only a few         of these schemes have expanded their application to complicated workspaces, or those that have many rooms or blocks. As the         navigation of mobile objects in complicated workspaces is vital for ubiquitous technology, multiblock navigation is necessary.         This article presents methodologies and techniques for the multiblock navigation of the indoor localization system with active         beacon sensors. This new indoor localization system design includes ultrasonic attenuation compensation, dilution-of-precision         analysis, and a fault detection and isolation algorithm using redundant measurements.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Takahiro Otani1| 2 | Makoto Koshino1 </authors><title>Applying a path planner based on RRT to cooperative multirobot box-pushing      </title><content>Considering robot systems in the real world, a multirobot system where multiple robots work simultaneously without colliding         with each other is more practical than a single-robot system where only one robot works. Therefore, solving the path-planning         problem in a multirobot system is very important.                     In this study, we developed a path-planner based on the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT), which is a data structure and               algorithm designed for efficiently searching for multirobot box-pushing, and made experiments in real environments. A path               planner must construct a plan which avoids the robot colliding with obstacles or with other robots. Moreover, in some cases,               a robot must collaborate with other robots to transport the box without colliding with any obstacles. Our proposed path planner               constructs a box-transportation plan and the path plans of each robot bearing the above considerations in mind.            </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Malachy Eaton1  | J.

ASO is one of the typical diseases that cause         chronic ischemia of the limbs and lead to obstruction of the blood flow. In diagnosing ASO, lower contrast enhanced computed         tomography (CT) is useful for observing the arteries. However, it is a huge task for radiologists to separate accurately only         the arteries which are involved in the disease, using the manual or semiautomatic proprietary software which is supplied for         lower computed tomographic angiography (CTA).

In this technique an N-Quoit filter, which is a useful filter for the detection of         lung nodules, is applied to identify the arteries in CTA images.

In our former study, we have already proposed a nongeometric binary crossover operator to generate an offspring         outside the line segment between its parents. In this article, we examine the effect of our crossover operator on the performance         of evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms through computational experiments on various multiobjective knapsack         problems.

In addition, the physical support by them must be based on the individual&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;action&amp;#8221;         and &amp;#8220;sensation&amp;#8221; in order that the physical support becomes really human-friendly. Then, the robots must actively recognize         the unknown environment according to the individual&amp;#8217;s action. They also have to transmit the environmental information obtained         to the individual in harmony with their sensations. Since haptic information is so important, as well as visual information         and auditory information, the development of realworld haptics is one of the important key issues for the purpose. Haptic         information is inherently bilateral, since an action is always accompanied by a reaction. That means that bilateral control         with high transparency is necessary to transmit real-world haptic information artificially. A acceleration-based bilateral         controller is one of the solutions for realizing high transparency. There remain many issues to solve for the application         of haptics to the physical support of actual human activities. A haptic system with high transparency should obtain flexibility         in order to extend its function. This article presents flexible actuation techniques that have high force transferability         and flexibility in actuators&amp;#8217; arrangements. Furthermore, in order to support human activities in remote environments, bilateral         telehaptics over a network is also described. Finally, this article introduces the fundamental techniques in haptics, including         several examples of medical applications, since they are the first target of real-world haptics.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Fusaomi Nagata1 | Tetsuo Hase2| Zenku Haga2| Masaaki Omoto2 | Keigo Watanabe3</authors><title>Intelligent desktop NC machine tool with compliant motion capability      </title><content>In this paper, a new desktop NC machine tool with compliance control capability is presented for finishing metallic molds         with small curved surface.

The control system of the NC machine tool is composed of a force feedback loop, position         feedback loop and position feed-forward loop. The force feedback loop controls the polishing force consisting of tool contact         force and kinetic friction force. The position feedback loop controls the position in pick feed direction. Further, the position         feed-forward loop leads the tool tip along cutter location data.

By analyzing the dynamics         of purpose and goals, and the self-referential property in observations of the games played, we claim that Minimum Nomic is         an interesting tool to study rule dynamics.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Henrik Hautop Lund1 | Martin Dam Pedersen1 | Richard Beck1</authors><title>Modular robotic tiles: experiments for children with autism      </title><content>We developed a modular robotic tile and a system composed of a number of these modular robotic tiles. The system composed         of the modular robotic tiles engages the user in physical activities, e.g., physiotherapy, sports, fitness, and entertainment.         The modular robotic tiles motivate the user to perform physical activities by providing immediate feedback based upon their         physical interaction with the system. With the modular robotic tiles, the user is able to make new physical set-ups within         less than a minute. The tiles are applicable for different forms of physical activities (e.g., therapeutic rehabilitation),         and with the proper radio communication mechanism they may give unique possibilities for documentation of the physical activity         (e.g., therapeutic treatment). A major point of concern in modular robotics is the connection mechanism, so we investigated         different solutions for the connection between the modules, and outline their pros and cons for utilizing modules with different         connection mechanisms as different kinds of playware. This kind of playware is highly motivating because of its immediate         feedback and fun, interesting games.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Hiroshi Kinjo1 | Eiho Uezato1| Sam Chau Duong2 | Tetsuhiko Yamamoto3</authors><title>Neurocontroller with a genetic algorithm for nonholonomic systems: flying robot and four-wheel vehicle examples      </title><content>This article considers intelligent control for a class of nonholonomic systems using a neurocontroller (NC) and a genetic         algorithm (GA). First, we introduce the design of the NC with use of the GA, and then we apply the NC to control two typical         examples of nonholonomic systems: a hopping robot in the flight phase and a four-wheel vehicle. In order to verify the effectiveness         of the control system, the performance of the NC is investigated and also compared to that of the so-called direct gradient         descent control (DGDC) approach, which is able to utilize a GA with the same examples in the comparison. Simulations show         that the NC could achieve a competitive performance and control the nonholonomic systems effectively. Furthermore, the use         of the NN and GA provide a straightforward solution for the problem without the need of the chained form conversion.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Atsushi Kamimura1 | Takashi Shimada1 | Nobuyasu Ito1</authors><title>Nonequilibrium dynamics of a reacting network system      </title><content>The nonlinear nonequilibrium properties of reacting network systems are studied by computer simulations.

An open problem in the field of self-replication         is the design of a physical SRPC made from simple parts taken from a small set and using for its supply of parts (from which         to construct things) a disorganized collection of parts distributed in a random fashion in its environment. A machine capable         of doing this will need to contain a subsystem capable of taking an unknown part from its environment and determining which         kind of part it is. The architecture of a discriminating subsystem of this kind is of course highly dependant on the precise         nature and size of the set of parts used. The general principles of this type of discriminating system are discussed, and         a specific design for such a system in an abstract discrete-space kinematic simulation environment is presented.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>Yohsuke Murase1| Takashi Shimada1  | Nobuyasu Ito1</authors><title>Phase diagram and stability of ecosystems      </title><content>The relation between diversity and the interaction of species in ecosystems has been studied using a population dynamics model         with scale-invariant interaction terms where new species are introduced randomly.

Microarray data are expected to be of significant help in the development of an efficient         cancer diagnosis and classification platform. A major problem in these data is that the number of genes greatly exceeds the         number of tissue samples. These data also have noisy genes. It has been shown in literature reviews that selecting a small         subset of informative genes can lead to improved classification accuracy. Therefore, this paper aims to select a small subset         of informative genes that are most relevant for cancer classification.

If there is a helper who has direct access to objects in virtual space, we may ask them. The question, however,         is how to communicate with the helper.

In the system, like Avida, digital creatures, self-replicating programs, live in a discrete 2D torus         space and an interaction between creatures is restricted locally. Bearing a genetic network in mind, network structure is         introduced. In the previous works, it is shown that the possibility that the network-type model has more potential of evolution         than a linear-type model like Avida in a simple environment. In this paper, to study the potential of evolution more precisely,         we model the effects of environment other than creatures. As one of the simplest models of such environment, the cost of execution,         i.e. executing time, is introduced. The difficult environment to live in costs high to execute instructions, the easy environment         does low. In computer experiments, we have investigated the influence of change in environment by analyzing the process of         evolution and diversity of the system. Experimental results show that the network-type system keeps more stable diversity         than the linear-type system does, even when the environment changes drastically. This indicates the possibility that the network-type         system has more potential of evolution than the linear-type system has.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Yau-Zen Chang1 | Zhi-Ren Tsai2 | Shih-Tseng Lee3</authors><title>3D registration of human face using evolutionary computation and Kriging interpolation      </title><content>This paper proposes a fast and robust 3D human face geometric data registration strategy dedicated for image-guided medical         applications. The registration scheme is composed of a coarse transformation stage and a fine-tuning stage. In the first stage,         fuzzy c-mean is used to reduce the data amount of template 3D image, and evolutionary computation is implemented to find optimal         initial pose for the Iterative Closest Point plus k-dimensional (KD) tree scheme. In the second stage, the huge reference         image data are replaced by a Kriging model. The time-consuming search for corresponding points in evaluating the degree of         misalignment is substituted by projecting the points in the template image onto the model. To illustrate the validity and         applicability of the proposed approach, a problem composed of 174 635 points reference image and an 11 280 points template         image is demonstrated. Computational results show that our approach accelerates the registration process from 1361.28 seconds         to 432.85 seconds when compared with the conventional ICP plus K-D tree scheme, while the average misalignment reduces from         11.35 mm to 2.33 mm.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Sajal Ch|ra Banik1| Keigo Watanabe1  | Kiyotaka Izumi1</authors><title>A computational model of emotion through the perspective of benevolent agents for a cooperative task      </title><content>This paper deals with a computational model of emotions and its application for cooperative benevolent agents.

The interpreters perform appropriate operations in nodes, while passing other parts of the scenario, together with intermediate         data, to other interpreters in a coordinated manner. This process covers the system at runtime, and sets up distributed command         and control infrastructures providing the overall integrity and goal orientation. This approach allows us to manage robotized         systems in unpredictable and hostile environments, with possible failures of components. The language description and programming         examples in it are provided.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Satoshi Osaga1| Jun-ichiro Hirayama2| Takashi Takenouchi2 | Shin Ishii1 </authors><title>A probabilistic modeling of MOSAIC learning      </title><content>Humans can generate accurate and appropriate motor commands in various, and even uncertain, environments. MOSAIC (MOdular         Selection And Identification for Control) was originally proposed to describe this human ability, but this model is hard to         analyze mathematically because of its emphasis on biological plausibility. In this article, we present an alternative and         probabilistic model of MOSAIC (p-MOSAIC) as a mixture of normal distributions and an online EM-based learning method for its         predictors and controllers. A theoretical consideration shows that the learning rule of p-MOSAIC corresponds to that of MOSAIC         except for some points which are mostly related to the learning of controllers. The results of experiments using synthetic         datasets demonstrate some practical advantages of p-MOSAIC. One is that the learning rule of p-MOSAIC stabilizes the estimation         of &amp;#8220;responsibility.&amp;#8221; Another is that p-MOSAIC realizes more accurate control and robust parameter learning in comparison to         the original MOSAIC, especially in noisy environments, due to the direct incorporation of the noises into the model.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Masayuki Fujisawa1 | Yoshiteru Ishida1| 2 </authors><title>A probabilistic simulator for population dynamics of quasispecies      </title><content>We constructed a probabilistic simulator that allows all the events in population dynamics such as death, birth, mutation,         and suppression/stimulation to be described by probabilistic rules.

The addition of new memories beyond the capacity         overloads the network system and makes all learned memories irretrievable (catastrophic forgetting) unless there is a provision for forgetting old memories. This article describes a property of associative memory networks         in which a number of units are replaced when networks learn. In our network, every time the network learns a new item or pattern,         a number of units are erased and the same number of units are added. It is shown that the memory capacity of the network depends         on the number of replaced units, and that there exists a optimal number of replaced units in which the memory capacity is         maximized. The optimal number of replaced units is small, and seems to be independent of the network size.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Moritoshi Yasunaga1 | Noriyuki Aibe1| Yoshiki Yamaguchi1| Yorihisa Yamamoto2| Takaaki Awano3 | Ikuo Yoshihara4</authors><title>A reconfigurable VLSI-based double-lens tracking camera      </title><content>Watching and tracking an object while seeing a much wider view is one of advantages of the eye system.

Combining rules and cases makes it possible to solve problems accurately and quickly, and to acquire new cases from         problem-solving results. In general case-based problem-solving methods, the similarity metric must be defined for each problem         domain. In previous work using rules and cases, a threshold of negative case applications had to be adjusted. The proposed         AKB does not require manual adjustment of the threshold and the similarity metric.

Experimental results have showed               that the case acquisition and similarity weight adjustment can reduce errors, and that the threshold adjustment significantly               reduces segmentation errors.            </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Nguyen Hoang Giap1| Jin-Ho Shin2  | Won-Ho Kim2</authors><title>Adaptive robust fuzzy control for path tracking of a wheeled mobile robot      </title><content>This paper proposes an adaptive robust fuzzy control scheme for path tracking of a wheeled mobile robot with uncertainties.         The robot dynamics including the actuator dynamics is considered in this work. The presented controller is composed of a fuzzy         basis function network (FBFN) to approximate an unknown nonlinear function of the robot complete dynamics, an adaptive robust         input to overcome the uncertainties, and a stabilizing control input. The stability and the convergence of the tracking errors         are guaranteed using the Lyapunov stability theory. When the controller is designed, the different parameters for two actuator         models in the dynamic equation are taken into account. The proposed control scheme does not require the accurate parameter         values for the actuator parameters as well as the robot parameters. The validity and robustness of the proposed control scheme         are demonstrated through computer simulations.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Jorge Aurelio Tejedor1 | Luis FernГЎndez1| Fern|o Arroyo1 | GinГ©s Bravo1</authors><title>An architecture for attacking the communication bottleneck in P systems      </title><content>The distributed implementation of P systems on a cluster of processors has met with a bottleneck communications problem.

This includes the proper consideration of the oscillator&amp;#8217;s parameters, such as a time constant for         the adaptation rate, coupling factors for mutual inhibitory connections, etc., to obtain a stable and desirable response from         the network.

The kinematics and dynamics of a five-link biped robot have been modeled, and its joints are actuated through         simulation by the torques output from the neural rhythm generator to generate the trajectories for hip, knee, and ankle joints.

In contrast, our approach, which uses the YIQ color system with a background estimation         method for skin color extraction, achieved a good performance more than 30 fps, with strong robustness in complicated and         poorly illuminated environments.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Keisuke Ichida1| Kiyotaka Izumi1| Keigo Watanabe1  | Nobuhiro Uchida1</authors><title>Control of three-link underactuated manipulators using a switching method of fuzzy energy regions      </title><content>In general, manipulators used for industry and in academic laboratories have actuators to drive each joint. On the other hand,         underactuated manipulators handled by our research have some passive or free joints without actuators and brakes. We recently         developed a switching method of fuzzy energy regions to control such manipulators. In such a method, it is necessary to design         parameters related to energy regions and the gains of some partly stable controllers based on the computed torque method.         Here, the switching method is applied for a three-link underactuated manipulator. We optimize such design parameters related         to fuzzy energy regions by a genetic algorithm. The effectiveness of the present method is illustrated with some simulations.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Shinichi Sagara1  | Yuichiro Taira2</authors><title>Cooperative manipulation of a floating object by some space robots: application of a tracking control method using the transpose         of the generalized Jacobian matrix      </title><content>In future space missions, it is considered that many tasks will be achieved by cooperative motions of space robots.

Constant terms which arise from section-wise         linearization of a given nonlinear system are treated as coefficients of a stable zero dynamics. Parameters included in the         control are suboptimally selected by the genetic algorithm so as to minimize a performance made of the Hamiltonian and the         absolute antiwindup measure. This approach is applied to a field excitation control problem of a power system to demonstrate         the superiority of the AACC.

We developed software to control a robot&amp;#8217;s actions including emotion by introducing         the evaluation function of action choice into the hierarchical structure model. This connected the robot&amp;#8217;s consciousness with         the robot&amp;#8217;s action. We named the process Consciousness-based Architecture (CBA). However, it is difficult to change the consciousness         of the robot only using this CBA model. In order to induce and change autonomously consciousness and action for the robot,         some motivation is required. Therefore, a motivation model has been developed to induce and change autonomously, and is combined         with CBA. To inspect CBA including the motivation model, a robot arm (Conbe-I) has been developed with a small Web camera         built into the fingers. CBA was installed on this Conbe-I, and the autonomous actions performed to catch an object were inspected.         A motivation model of the robot was devised to describe interests for the aim thing of the robot and the desire of the robot.

However, the         conventional positioning system that has three standard stations, is applicable for the field with no obstacle, because its         principal depends on the time based measurement. Therefore, we developed a new underwater positioning system based on sensor         network technology that is using a lot of standard stations equipping hydrophone and GPS sensor on the water surface.

When a robot operates in a human environment, the issue of safety must         be considered in regard to its autonomous movement. Thus, robots absolutely require systems that can recognize the external         world and perform correct driving control. We have thus developed a navigation system for an autonomous robot. The system         requires only image data captured by an ocellus CCD camera. In this system, we allow the robot to search for obstacles present         on the floor. Then, the robot obtains distance recognition necessary for evasion of the object, including data of the obstacle&amp;#8217;s         width, height, and depth by calculating the angles of images taken by the CCD camera.

This         virus is highly virulent in humans, who are infected directly from birds. However, the virus still has not acquired human-to-human         transmission capability. If a new strain of the virus capable of sustaining human-to-human transmission emerges, it could         cause an influenza pandemic. We propose the use of the SEIR epidemic model of influenza transmission to assess the influence         of facility closure as a containment strategy for such an epidemic. If the fraction of infected individuals exceeds a set         threshold, we apply the facility-closure countermeasures for a set period. If the basic reproduction number R         0 is assumed to be 2.0, our model suggests that long-term facility closure is usually a desirable nonpharmaceutical measure,         but it may not necessarily reduce the prevalence.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Masashi Mishima1| 2 | Mieko Tanaka-Yamawaki1 </authors><title>Effective indices to characterize short sequences of human random generations      </title><content>Brain impediments such as dementia are a serious problem today.

Human-generated random numbers have strong characteristics         compared to computer-generated random numbers, and these are known to be correlated to the individual characters of the subjects.

In crisp discretization, each         attribute is split into several intervals and handled as discrete numbers. Although crisp discretization is a convenient tool,         it is not appropriate in some situations (e.g., when there is no clear boundary and we cannot set a clear threshold). To address         such a problem, several discretizations with fuzzy sets have been proposed. In this paper we examine the effect of fuzzy discretization         derived from crisp discretization. The fuzziness of fuzzy discretization is controlled by a fuzzification grade F. We examine two procedures for the setting of F. In one procedure, we set F beforehand and do not change it through training rule-based classifiers. In the other procedure, first we set F and then change it after training. Through computational experiments, we show that the accuracy of rule-based classifiers         is improved by an appropriate setting of the grade of fuzzification. Moreover, we show that increasing the grade of fuzzification         after training classifiers can often improve generalization ability.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Ken Naitoh1 </authors><title>Engine for cerebral development      </title><content>A deterministic theoretical model that simulates the developmental process of the human brain is proposed. Observations of         the development of the human brain with a high-speed camera show that the bones of the skull become increasingly larger over         the neck, and that a lot of soup-like fluid for generating brain cells enters the skull from the body. This process is essentially         similar to the intake process of an internal combustion engine, because the volume of the engine&amp;#8217;s cylinder, which increases         according to the descent of the piston, geometrically corresponds to the development of the skull, and also because the human         neck resembles the intake port that serves as the throat of the engine. A higher-order numerical computation of the Navier-Stokes         equation reveals the similarity between the convexoconcave forms inside the brain and the flow structure in the internal combustion         engine. We will show that the present computation also simulates the emergence of the eyeballs. Finally, we will clarify the         reason why cerebral development is strongly influenced by fluid dynamics.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Yuta Aoki1 | Yoshiteru Ishida1| 2 </authors><title>Epidemic models and a self-repairing network with a simple lattice      </title><content>We have proposed a self-repairing network where nodes are capable of repairing neighboring nodes by mutually copying.

A post-processor is proposed to transform a base tool path called cutter location data (CL         data) to NC data, mapping the y-directional pick feed to the rotational angle of the rotary unit. The 3D machining system with the postprocessor allows us         easily to transcribe a relief design on a flat model surface to a cylindrical model surface. The postprocessor has another         function that systematically adjusts the feed-rate according to the curvature of each design to prevent the machined surface         from being chipped. The post-processor generates suitable feed-rate codes by using a simple fuzzy reasoning method while checking         the edges in relief designs. Experimental results show that wooden paint rollers with attractive relief designs can be successfully         machined without undesirable edge chipping. Next, the proposed fuzzy feed-rate generator is further applied to a mold-polishing         robot, so that the polishing time can be reduced by about 30% compared with the case without the generator.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Yutaka Fujihara1 | Takayuki Hanamoto2 | Fengzhi Dai1</authors><title>Fundamental research on polymer material as artificial muscle      </title><content>Current breakthroughs in industrial and scientific technology produce various instruments for down-sizing and weight saving,         but metal parts are widely used for magnetic motors.

Among them, the serial-parallel production line (S-PPL) is one of the more common production         styles in many modern industries. One of the methods used for studying the S-PPL design is through a genetic algorithm (GA).         One of the important jobs in using a GA is how to express a chromosome. In this study, we attempt to find the nearest optimal         design of a S-PPL that will maximize production efficiency by optimizing the following three decision variables: buffer size         between each pair of work stations, machine numbers in each of the work stations, and machine types. In order to do this we         present a new GA-simulation-based method to find the nearest optimal design for our proposed S-PPL. For efficient use of a         GA, our GA methodology is based on a technique that is called the gene family arrangement method (GFAM), which arranges the         genes inside individuals. An application example shows that after a number of operations based on the proposed simulator,         the nearest optimal design of a S-PPL can be found.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Orazio Miglino1| 2| Onofrio Gigliotta3| 2| Michela Ponticorvo1| 2  | Henrik H.

While traditionally robots are selected to reproduce automatically according to a fitness formula, which         is a quantitative and strictly defined measure, human breeders can operate selection based on qualitative criteria, and rewarding         behaviors that can slip between the meshes woven by the fitness formula. In authors&amp;#8217; opinion this may bring advantages to         the evolutionary robotics methodology, allowing the production of robots that display more, and more multiform, behaviors.         In order to illustrate this approach, the software Breedbot was developed in which human breeders can intervene in evolving         robots, complementing the automatic evaluation. After describing the software, some results on sample evolutionary processes         are reported showing that the joint use of human and artificial selection on an exploration task generates robots with a higher         performance and in a shorter time compared with the exclusive action of each breeding method. Future work will explore this         hypothesis further.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Yau-Zen Chang1 | Kao-Ting Hung1 | Shih-Tseng Lee2</authors><title>Human face detection with neural networks and the DIRECT algorithm      </title><content>Based on Rowley&amp;#8217;s approach, this article proposes a new architecture that uses a specific optimization technique, the DIRECT         (DIviding RECTangle) algorithm, to improve the efficiency of face detection in images. The system consists of two main parts:         a neural network-based face detection arbitrator, and a search strategy based on an integer-handling DIRECT algorithm. By         the architecture, the number of arbitrations is dramatically reduced, and human faces, if they are present in an image, are         not restricted to predetermined resolutions and aspect ratios. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture is         efficient in terms of both speed and robustness.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Masayuki Fukumoto1| Takehito Ogata1| Joo Kooi Tan1| Hyoung Seop Kim1 | Seiji Ishikawa1 </authors><title>Human motions representation and recognition by directional motion history images      </title><content>In this paper, we describe a technique for representing and recognizing human motions using directional motion history images.         A motion history image is a single human motion image produced by superposing binarized successive motion image frames so         that older frames may have smaller weights. It has, however, difficulty that the latest motion overwrites older motions, resulting         in inexact motion representation and therefore incorrect recognition. To overcome this difficulty, we propose directional         motion history images which describe a motion with respect to four directions of movement, i.e. up, down, right and left, employing optical flow. The directional motion history images are thus a set of four motion history         images defined on four optical flow images. Experimental results show that the proposed technique achieves better performance         in the recognition of human motions than the existent motion history images.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Sajal Ch|ra Banik1| Keigo Watanabe1  | Kiyotaka Izumi1</authors><title>Improvement of group performance of job distributed mobile robots by an emotionally biased control system      </title><content>This paper deals with the implementation of emotions in mobile robots performing a specified task in a group in order to develop         intelligent behavior and easier forms of communication. The overall group performance depends on the individual performance,         group communication, and the synchronization of cooperation. With their emotional capability, each robot can distinguish the         changed environment, can understand a colleague robot&amp;#8217;s state, and can adapt and react with a changed world. The adaptive         behavior of a robot is derived from the dominating emotion in an intelligent manner. In our control architecture, emotion         plays a role to select the control precedence among alternatives such as behavior modes, cooperation plans, and goals. Emotional         interaction happens among the robots, and a robot is biased by the emotional state of a colleague robot in performing a task.         Here, emotional control is used for a better understanding of the colleague&amp;#8217;s internal state, for faster communication, and         for better performance eliminating dead time.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Khairul Salleh1| 2| Hiroaki Seki2 | Yoshitsugu Kamiya2 | Masatoshi Hikizu2</authors><title>Inchworm robot grippers for clothes manipulation      </title><content>Manipulating deformable objects like clothes, plastic, and paper by a robot is very challenging. This paper focuses on clothes         manipulation as an example. A tracing manipulation method is used here to find a corner of the clothes. In this paper, tracing         refers to tracing the clothes&amp;#8217; edge, with the robot&amp;#8217;s movement based on feedback from sensors. One difficulty during this         edge tracing is to make the robot trace smoothly and speedily without dropping the clothes in the process. This is due to         the fact that deformable objects are sensitive to contact forces. A solution to this problem is to design a special robot         gripper that can trace the clothes without having to worry about the clothes slipping away. In this paper, the development         of inchworm-type grippers is proposed. Two sets of grippers inside a robot hand will allow the robot to trace the clothes         more freely because there will always be a gripper firmly holding the clothes at any time. A unique tracing method for towel         spreading using the inchworm grippers is also discussed. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of both         the proposed grippers and also the algorithm.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Ken Naitoh1 </authors><title>Inevitability of nTP: information &amp;#8212; energy carriers      </title><content>Adenine is naturally selected as the main energy carrier from among two types of purines. C. Duve mentions that the inevitability         of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is still a mystery. We examined the databases of DNA, RNA, and codon in order to clarify whether         guanosine triphosphate (GTP) is mainly used for information storage in nucleic acids, because the adenine-uracil pair with         a weaker connection would be dropped out relatively among the information carrier candidates due to natural selection. This         paper presents a simple hypothesis that the relatively lower rates of adenine (A) and uracil (U) than the rates of guanine         (G) and cytosine (C) observed in the RNAs for a lot of species cause redundant monomers of ATP and uridine triphosphate (UTP)         outside nucleic acids, which become energy carriers. ATP runoff from RNA resembles the joker (or remaining unmatched queen)         in the card game of Old Maid. The other redundant monomers of UTP might become polysaccharide generators. Actual frequencies         of G and C in the RNAs of hyper-thermophiles are more than double those of A and U. A-U pairs are also fewer in number than         G-C pairs in microorganisms such as yeast.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Ken Naitoh1  | Motohide Yahiro2</authors><title>Inevitability of spiral-shape in DNA      </title><content>Cyto-fluid dynamic theory, which clarifies the inevitability of the size ratio of purine and pyrimidine in the base-pairs,         is extended to reveal the inevitability of the spiral-shape in DNA, i.e., the double-strand of bases-pairs. First, we will         define the cluster consisting of a nitrogenous base and water molecules as continuum flexible column. Then, the differential         equation describing deformation motions of the columns having spiral-shapes is derived based on the momentum conservation         law. The stability theory, which is based on the concept of the quasistability weaker than the neutral stability, clarifies         the inevitability of the spiral shape of B-DNA.

In the proposed method, a fuzzy PID controller is expressed in terms of fuzzy rules, in which the input variables         are the error signals and their derivatives, while the output variables are the PID gains. In this manner, the PID gains are         adaptive and the fuzzy PID controller has more flexibility and capability than the conventional ones with fixed gains. To         tune the fuzzy PID controller simultaneously, an evolutionary learning algorithm integrating particle swarm optimization (PSO)         and genetic algorithm (GA) methods is proposed. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed method is indeed more         efficient in improving the asymptotical stability of the pendubot system.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Young Im Cho1 </authors><title>Intelligent automatic community grouping system by multiagents      </title><content>We have developed an intelligent ubiquitous web-based e-learning system based on multiagents.

New knowledge learned by a human is often related to old existing knowledge, and sometimes we could have more conceptual         knowledge based on old knowledge. So, the knowledge in the brain exists in a related structural form, and this structure is         dynamic, and therefore is evolvable. Based on the understanding of the real process of learning by a human being, we discuss         how to make a model to describe the dynamic structure of knowledge. This model is also a principle of artificial brain design.         Most of the knowledge a child learns is from natural language and perception information, and we define this as semantic knowledge.         The model to describe the process and structure of knowledge growing in a network form is called a K-net. It is a dynamic         network with two main dynamics: one is new knowledge added, and the other is aggregating knowledge existing in the network         with some probability. Under these very natural conditions, we found that the network is originally a simple random net, and         then some characteristics of a complex network gradually appear when more new knowledge is added and aggregated. A more interesting         phenomenon is the appearance of a random hierarchical structure.

Simulation results show that the fitness increases rapidly and remains         at a high level, while the phenotypic plasticity increases together with the fitness, but then decreases and gradually converges         to a medium value.

In this article, a method for lip detection         in color images in a normalized RGB color scheme is presented. In this method, MLP neural networks are used to perform lip         detection on segmented skin regions. Several combinations of chrominance components of the normalized RGB color space were         used as the input to the neural networks. Two methods were used for obtaining the normalized RGB components from the RGB color         scheme. These are called the maximum and intensity normalization methods, respectively. The method was tested on two Asian         databases. The number of neurons in the hidden layer was determined by using a modified network-growing algorithm. It was         found that the pixel intensity normalization method gave lower lip detection error than the maximum intensity normalization         method regardless of the database used, and for most of the combinations of chrominance components. In addition, the combination         of the g and r/g chrominance components gave the lowest lip detection error when the pixel intensity normalization method         was used for both databases. The effects of the scale and facial expression on lip detection was also studied. It was found         that the lip detection error decreased as the scale factor increased. As for facial expression, a laughing facial expression         gave the highest lip detection error, followed by smiling and neutral expressions.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Byoung-Suk Choi1  | Ju-Jang Lee1</authors><title>Localization of a mobile robot based on an ultrasonic sensor using dynamic obstacles      </title><content>In this article, we propose a localization scheme for a mobile robot based on the distance between the robot and moving objects.         This method combines the distance data obtained from ultrasonic sensors in a mobile robot, and estimates the location of the         mobile robot and the moving object. The movement of the object is detected by a combination of data and the object&amp;#8217;s estimated         position. Then, the mobile robot&amp;#8217;s location is derived from the a priori known initial state. We use kinematic modeling that         represents the movement of a robot and an object. A Kalman-filtering algorithm is used for addressing estimation error and         measurement noise. Throughout the computer simulation experiments, the performance is verified. Finally, the results of experiments         are presented and discussed.

Toward energy autonomy, we initially present a simulation of a multiagent robotic system in         which each robot is capable of exchanging energy cells with other robots. Our simulation points out that: (1) each robot is         able not only to act as an autonomous agent, but also to interact with others to be beyond the individual capabilities; (2)         in order to adapt to changes in the environment, each robot is situated as an adaptive agent in a network of neighboring robots,         which leads to a state of energy autonomy. Finally, based on the results of the simulation, we adjust the rules for our real         multirobot system.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Tetsuro Morimura1| 2 | Eiji Uchibe2 | Kenji Doya2| 3| 4</authors><title>Natural actor-critic with baseline adjustment for variance reduction      </title><content>In this study, we discuss a baseline function for the estimation of a natural policy gradient with respect to variance, and         demonstrate a condition in which an optimal baseline function that reduces the variance is equivalent to the state value function.

In addition,         the distance to an object and the perception of its size can be estimated by a sense of distance based on memory or experience.         Therefore, the environment for robotic activity assumed in this study was a finite-space such as a family room, an office,         or a hospital room. Because an accurate estimation of position is important to the success of a robot, we have developed a         navigation system with self-localization ability which uses only a CCD camera that can detect whether the robot is moving         accurately in a room or corridor. This article describes how this system has been implemented and tested with our developed         robot.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Makito Oku1  | Kazuyuki Aihara1| 2| 3</authors><title>Networked reinforcement learning      </title><content>Recently, many models of reinforcement learning with hierarchical or modular structures have been proposed. They decompose         a task into simpler subtasks and solve them by using multiple agents. However, these models impose certain restrictions on         the topological relations of agents and so on. By relaxing these restrictions, we propose networked reinforcement learning,         where each agent in a network acts autonomously by regarding the other agents as a part of its environment. Although convergence         to an optimal policy is no longer assured, by means of numerical simulations, we show that our model functions appropriately,         at least in certain simple situations.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Masatoshi Nishi1 | Mitsuaki Ishitobi1 | Kazuhide Nakasaki1</authors><title>Nonlinear adaptive control system design and experiment for a 3-DOF model helicopter      </title><content>This paper deals with model following control of a model helicopter with three degree-of-freedom.

Pareto-optimal rules,         which are Pareto-optimal in terms of confidence and support maximization, have an interesting characteristic that Pareto-optimal         rules maximize other various rule evaluation criteria. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of designing classifiers         from Pareto-optimal rules. We consider not only Pareto-optimal rules but also near Pareto-optimal rules. To show the effectiveness,         we compare classifiers obtained from Pareto-optimal and near Pareto-optimal rules with classifiers obtained from the rules         that have large value in terms of other different rule evaluation criteria. Eight criteria are examined in this paper: CF,         confidence, cover, Laplace, lift, random, slave, support. Through computational experiments, we show that classifiers obtained         from Pareto-optimal rules have higher accuracy than those from rules extracted according to the other criteria.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Kazuhiro Kubo1 | Tokuzo Shimada1 </authors><title>Orbit systematics in anisotropic Kepler problem      </title><content>We revisit the Anisotropic Kepler Problem (AKP), which concerns with trajectories of an electron with anisotropic mass term         in a Coulomb field.

To do so, we defined a new concept that we call polymorphic intelligence.1 Such a concept comes up as a possible answer to many &amp;#8220;false&amp;#8221; paradigms and philosophical and conceptual orientations that         for decades have pervaded many research fields, such as education, art, literature, psychology, pedagogy, science, technology,         and AI. We believe, indeed, that in this exact moment of human history, it becomes necessary to clarify with a strong theoretical         paradigm what is the real relationship between machines and humans. Therefore, we propose to abandon the mental scheme by         which intelligence is an exclusive prerogative of humans in order to embrace the idea that machines have started to express         a real collaborative and/or competitive force, that they are able to produce ideation and inspiration, and to contribute to         the wealth of ideas.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>N.

However, in         the case of detecting the exact position in signal-blocked closed environment (e.g. inside building, forest, mines and others);         the accuracy factor provide by GPS is low. Thus, this project presents a positioning tracking system that is able to track         the movement of an object within a small area or inside buildings. A complete set of the positioning tracking system consists         of a pair of computer mechanical mouse and a microcontroller. From the position displayed on the computer screen, the position         of the object can be located. The pair of mouse detects each movement of the object and sends the movement data to microcontroller.         Linear, angular displacement and positioning calculation are also being discussed. From the results, it&amp;#8217;s shown that the positioning         system is applicable.

It is important for constructing the joint probability-distribution to consider the dependency         of events. We consider that some vagueness is included in the dependency. Because causal relationship of among events is uncertain,         it is difficult to express dependency as definite value. In this paper, we classify the dependent relations, and apply the         fuzzy probability to calculation of the dependence-index. Then, the fuzzy dependence-index is defined to consider dependency         with fuzziness. Using the fuzzy dependence-index, we calculate the joint probability of multi-events for constructing the         probabilistic model.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>H.

The layout design of the FTL has an important impact on material handling. In this paper, we develop a LAyout Design         system (LAD). LAD can find FTL layout design including the buffer size between each pair of FTL machine tools. LAD divides         the goal plant into cells and uses GA to find the efficient FTL layout design. In order to carry out GA, we propose a new         encoding method to express GA individual. The new encoding method is called a One by One Encoding Method (OOEM). OOEM generates         the elements of the individual one by one with the sequence of relative direction of the FTL components. The sequence of individual         elements indicates the sequence of machine tools and conveyer buffer spaces of FTL. The developed LAD based on the proposed         OOEM is not limited to a single static environment plant, but is highly flexible within the plant structure. An application         example was developed, and after a number of generations based on LAD, an efficient FTL layout design was able to be found.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Shota Nakashima1  | Seiichi Serikawa1</authors><title>Proposal of a method to extract straight line and circle using one-dimensional histogram      </title><content>A new method for fast extraction of straight line and circle is proposed in this study.

One of these difficulties occurs in recognizing topological properties of three-dimensional patterns because the three-dimensional         neighborhood is more complicated than two-dimensional case. Generally a property or relationship is topological only if it         is preserved when an arbitrary &amp;#8220;rubber-sheet&amp;#8221; distortion is applied to the pictures. For example, adjacency and connectedness         are topological; area, elongatedness, convexity, and straightness are not. In recent years, there have been many interesting         papers on digital topological properties. For example, an interlocking component was defined as a new topological property         in three-dimensional digital pictures, and it was proved that no one marker automaton can recognize interlocking components         in a three-dimensional digital picture. In this paper, we deal with recognizability of topological components by three-dimensional         Turing machines, and investigate some properties.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Takayuki Yamada1 </authors><title>Remarks on tracking method of neural network weight change for adaptive type neural network feedforward feedback controller      </title><content>A cost function is useful for a confirmation of neural network controller learning performance, but, this confirmation may         not be correct for neural networks.

Generally, it is time-consuming for GAs to find the solutions, and sometimes they cannot find the global         optima. In order to improve their search performance, we propose a fast GA algorithm called momentum GA, which employs momentum         offspring (MOS) and constant range mutation (CRM). MOS, which generates offspring based on the best individuals of current         and past generations, is considered to have the effect of fast searching for the optimum solutions. CRM is considered to have         the ability to avoid the production of ineffective individuals and maintain the diversity of the population. In order to verify         the performance of our proposed method, a comparison between momentum GA and the conventional mean will be implemented by         utilizing optimization problems of two multivariable functions and neural network training problems with different activation         functions.

For this experiment, we used real data of         bladder cancer patients provided by Kitasato University Hospital. When using input data with missing values for SOM, the missing         value is either interpolated in the preprocessing stage, or the missing value is replaced with a specific value or property         that marks it as a missing value. In either case, there is a possibility some rules can be extracted from data with missing         values. On the other hand, these data can have a negative influence for the classification for data sets for which missing         values should be neglected. In this research we propose a method where SOM is trained using an input vector in which the properties         for the missing values are excluded. The influence of information on the missing values can be reduced by using the proposed         method.

The frequency         ratio in DNA is deterministic, while that in RNA is fairly stochastic.

The left-right symmetric distribution of arms and legs is observed in outward appearance, although         the inner body, including the heart and the liver, is asymmetric. A minimum hypercycle of four cycles at the origin of life         is also in the symbiotic fusion of symmetry and asymmetry.

When the number of membranes         grows in the system, the network gets congested and the times to execute an evolution step degrade. Several published analysis         have proved that there is a very strong relationship between communication time and evolution rules application time in membranes         of the system. Moreover, recent works present analysis for distributed architectures that are technology independent, based         on: allocation of several membranes in the same processor; the use of proxies for communication among processors; and, token         passing in the communication. These solutions avoid communication collisions, and reduce the number and length for communication         among membranes. All these facts allow to obtain a better evolution time than in others suggested architectures which they         get congested quickly by network collisions when the number of membranes grows. The aim of this work is to do an extrapolation         of the communications architectures denominated &amp;#8220;partially parallel evolution with partially parallel communication&amp;#8220;, to analyze         their suitability to be implemented using a low cost universal membrane hardware/software component based on microcontrollers.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Masahiro Tokumitsu1 | Yoshiteru Ishida1| 2 </authors><title>Synchrony in a self-repair network with a simple lattice      </title><content>We investigate a synchrony in a self-repairing network of autonomous agents capable of repairing mutually.

Computer simulations revealed that the synchronous model has a critical point, while the asynchronous one does not.

Recently, scientists have been conducting         research in biometrics using biomedical information. However, there is the problem that biomedical information is unchangeable.         For example, if a thief steals another user&amp;#8217;s biomedical information, that person has no information to register. Due to the         problems of sight information and unchangeable biomedical information, we propose a solution that uses the sense of tactile         stimuli. Tactile information is difficult to steal and relies on human memory, which is unchangeable. This paper proposes         a system that uses a pattern formed by a tactile stimuli time series instead of a password number as the identification key.         We also discuss the results of an identification experiment and a memory property experiment.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Nobuyuki Kukimoto1 | Yasuo Ebara2 | Koji Koyamada3</authors><title>Tele-immersive collaborative virtual environment for intuitive interpretation      </title><content>The purpose of tele-immersive collaboration is to enable people in separate locations to work together effectively by the         Virtual Reality (VR) technology facilitating the human intuitive insight and interpretation.

In this         paper, we constructed tele-immersive CVE with annotation capability and free-hand drawing of characters and figures into Immersive         Projection Technology (IPT) environment. In addition, participants from remote sites connected over a Wide Area Network (WAN)         were enabled to interact with each other by sharing annotations via a PDA application. Moreover, we developed applications         for scientific visualization and, for intellectual work based on KJ Method inside a tele-immersive CVE. From these results,         we are able to maintain essential information for thinking by making annotation on IPT environment, and have proved the system         can support intuitive understanding in remote collaborative work.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Masaomi Hatakeyama1| 2  | Takashi Hashimoto1</authors><title>The diversification of proto-cells driven by membrane permselectivity      </title><content>We consider how permselectivity as a function of the membrane is related to the cell evolution with an abstract proto-cell         model.

Simulations show that the relative timing of player moves, and         the reward for mutual cooperation, influences the strategy that eventually dominates the final population. For a synchronous         environment, reciprocal behavior appears to be the key to the evolution of cooperation, while in an asynchronous environment,         guarded generosity may be a route to the evolution of cooperation.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Daisuke Yamaguchi1 | Fumiyo Katayama1| Muneo Takahashi1| Masataka Arai2 | Kenneth J.

The signal transformation of the data representation methods         does not correspond well to the signal transformations happening at the single-cell level in neural systems.

CISSbot is abbreviated from         our center&amp;#8217;s name in Danish: Center for Indlejrede Software Systemer. The robots are designed toward truly autonomous robots         in large populations through energy trophallaxes. Unlike present mobile robots, the CISSbots are energetically autonomous         robots because they are not able not only to autonomously refuel by picking up batteries at a charging station, but also to         share energy by exchanging batteries with other robots. The CISSbots basically consist of their own processing power, sensors,         and actuators. However, to achieve the capability of battery exchange, the CISSbots need a special design of battery exchange         mechanism. In this paper, we present the realization of the design in both the mechanics and the electronics of the CISSbot.         Details of the battery exchange technique and power management are clarified. Finally, the article gives an outline of our         future work on the CISSbots.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>Takanobu Moriya1| Tokuzo Shimada1  | Hayato Fujigaki2</authors><title>Universality in globally coupled maps and flows      </title><content>We show that universality in chaotic elements can be lifted to that in complex systems.

As in a nonholonomic system, the vibration control method using a static continuous state feedback cannot stabilize         the load swing. It is necessary to design a time-varying feedback controller or a discontinuous feedback controller. We propose         a simple three-layered neural network as a controller (NC) with genetic algorithm-based (GA-based) training in order to control         load swing suppression for the rotary crane system. The NC is trained by a real-coded GA, which substantially simplifies the         design of the controller.

In the proposed technique, camera calibration is not required when taking images. Existing optical 3-D modeling systems must         employ calibrated cameras that are set at fixed positions. This inevitably puts constraints on the range of the movement of         an object. In the proposed method, multiple mobile cameras take images of a deformable object moving freely, and its 3-D model         is reconstructed from the video image streams obtained. The advantages of the proposed method include the fact that the cameras         employed are calibration-free, and that the image-taking cameras can move freely. The theory is described, and the performance         is shown by an experiment on 3-D human motion modeling in an outdoor environment.

In this article, we propose a cellular automata         (CA) model describing the interactions between the immune system and HIV, and examine the effect of the diversity of these         interactions. The novel aspects of our CA model are that it not only considers four states (HIV, virgin, dead, infect) but         also the diversity exhibited by both HIV and T cells. We simulated maximum diversities for these states by simulating CA on         a computer. The model revealed that increased diversity had the effect of increasing the HIV population and simulation steps.         In addition, we observed that the CA model accurately reflects the occurrence of infection, incubation period, and the development         of AIDS. The CA model demonstrated that the diversity of the virus is the major factor affecting the success rate of the escape         of HIV from the immune response.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Hajime Murao1 | Hisashi Tamaki2 | Shinzo Kitamura2</authors><title>A coevolutionary approach to adapt the genotype-phenotype map in genetic algorithms      </title><content>This article introduces a coevolutionary approach to genetic algorithms (GAs) for exploring not only within a part of the         solution space defined by the genotype-pheno-type map, but also the map itself. In canonical GAs with a fixed map, how large         an area of the solution space can be covered by possible genomes, and consequently how better solutions can be found by a         GA, rely on how well the geotype-phenotype map in designed, but it is difficult for designers of the algorithms to design         the map without a priori knowledge of the solution space. In the proposed algorithm, the genotype-phenotype map is improved         adaptively during the search process for solution candidates. It is applied to 3-bit deceptive problems such as of typical         combinatorial optimazation problems.

In general, actuators in robotic         systems are set with gears whose characteristics are elastic. Since a state feedback-type digital controller is usually used         for such a robotic system, the design of the feedback gain of the controller is important, because undesirable vibrations         or an overshoot in responses occur for high gains. Therefore the desired response, the output of a reference model, is designed         first, and the feedback gains are determined so that the response will coincide with the desired response, which is an optimization         problem. The gradient method works to some extent, but it takes a long time to get a satisfactory result. Thus we applied         the genetic algorithm (GA) to this nonlinear optimization problem, which gave the very first convergence. The gains obtained         have many useful applications. The results of a simulation are also given.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Ichiro Takeuchi1  | Takeshi Furuhashi1 </authors><title>A description of dynamic behavior of sensory/motor systems with fuzzy symbolic dynamic systems      </title><content>This paper presents a model of continuous sensory/motor systems for autonomous agents in naviga-tion problems.

The &amp;#8220;world&amp;#8221;         of interest is represented in a SPAK knowledge base by using a frame knowledge technique. This technique is chosen because         it can represent the world meaningfully and naturally. Relationships among frames, which represent things in the world, and         actions to be taken when certain things occur can be specified. In action, SPAK perceives changes in the environment, updates         the knowledge base if needed, and generates output actions according to the knowledge contents. To support robotic applications,         extensions to the conventional frame model are proposed. Various robotic applications can run cooperatively on top of SPAK.         Each can easily make use of the knowledge available, and share its knowledge with others. A SPAK knowledge editor allows simple         and intuitive development and modification of robot applications. To demonstrate these benefits, a prototype system and a         sample robot application are developed.

Second,         a subclass called the generalized asymmetric learning algorithm is investigated, and the kind of asymmetric structure which         is required in general to obtain the individual eigenvectors of the correlation matrix of a data sequence is clarified. Third,         focusing on a single-neuron model, a systematic way of deriving both PCA and MCA learning algorithms is shown, through which         a relation between the normalization in PCA algorithms and that in MCA algorithms is revealed.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Y.

This paper proposes a method of matching and a similarity         measure between two directed labeled graphs. We define the degree of similarity, the similar correspondence, and the similarity         map which denotes the matching between the graphs. As an approximate computing method, we apply genetic algorithms (GA) to         find a similarity map and compute the degree of similarity between graphs. For speed, we make parallel implementations in         almost all steps of the GA. We have implemented the sequential GA and the parallel GA in C programs, and made simulations         for both GAs. The simulation results show that our method is efficient and useful.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Tae-Yong Choi1 | So-Yeon Park1 | Ju-Jang Lee1</authors><title>A hybrid SOF-PID controller for a MIMO biped robot      </title><content>The application of the hybrid self-organizing fuzzy (SOF) PID controller to a multiinput multioutput nonlinear biped robot         is studied in this article. The SOF-PID controller was initially studied by H.B. Kazemian in 1998. Actually, his SOF-PID controller         has limits. The supervisory capacity of the SOF-PID controller can adjust only certain kinds of parameters. Here the hybrid         SOF-PID controller is introduced to tune some kinds of parameters, and it was tested on a MIMO biped robot. In the experiment,         the hybrid SOF-PID controller shows a better performance than the SOF-PID.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Sun-Gi Hong1  | Ju-Jang Lee1 </authors><title>A local motion planner for car-like robots in a cluttered environment      </title><content>This paper deals with the motion-planning problem for car-like robots (i.e., a mobile robot with nonholonomic and upper-bounded         curvature constraints).

Among these systems, the immune system plays an important role         in coping with dynamically changing environments by constructing self-nonself recognition networks among different species         of antibodies, and has many interesting features from an engineering stand-point, such as learning, self-organizing abilities,         and so on. However, it has not yet been applied to engineering fields. Therefore we pay close attention to the immune system         and attempt to construct an artificial immune network for robot control. In this study we propose a new interpretation of         the roles of antibodies in terms of self-assertion and subordination, and apply this idea to a gait coordination problem of         a hexapod robot as a practical example. Several computer simulations are carried out, and the robustness against disturbances         and the feasibility of our method are confirmed.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Xiaolin Zhang1  | Hidetoshi Wakamatsu2</authors><title>A new equivalent circuit different from the Hodgkin-Huxley model, and an equation for the resting membrane potential of a         cell      </title><content>A new generalized equivalent circuit of a cell is proposed which is different from that of Hodgkin and Huxley.

Using this equivalent         circuit, we derive a general equation to relate the resting membrane potential of a cell to the capacity of ion pumps, intracellular         impermeant, ion concentrations, extracellular ion concentrations, and the permeability of ions. Using this equation, the influence         of extracellular ion concentrations on the resting membrane potential was calculated and the results shed doubt on the validity         of using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation for biomembranes.

Several         polynomial time optimization algorithms have been proposed for approximating the multiprocessor scheduling problem. In this         paper, we suggest a geneticizedknowledge genetic algorithm (gkGA) as an efficient heuristic approach for solving the multiprocessor         scheduling and other combinatorial optimization problems. The basic idea behind the gkGA approach is that knowledge of the         heuristics to be used in the GA is also geneticized alongiside the genetic chromosomes. We start by providing four conversion         schemes based on heuristics for converting chromosomes into priority lists. Through experimental evaluation, we observe that         the performance of our GA based on each of these schemes is instance-dependent. However, if we simultaneously incorporate         these schemes into our GA through the gkGA approach, simulation results show that the approach is not problem-dependent, and         that the approach outperforms that of the previous GA. We also show the effectiveness of the gkGA approach compared with other         conventional schemes through experimental evaluation.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Baiquan Lu1 | Kotaro Hirasawa1 | Junichi Murata1</authors><title>A new learning method using prior information of neural networks      </title><content>In this paper, we present a new learning method using prior information for three-layer neural networks. Usually when neural         networks are used for identification of systems, all of their weights are trained independently, without considering interrelated         weights values. Thus, the training results are usually not good. The reason for this in that each parameter has its influence         on others during learning. To overcome this problem, we first give an exact mathematical equation that describes the relation         between weight values given a set of data conveying prior information. The we present a new learning method that trains part         of the weights and calculates the others using these exact mathematical equations. This method often a priori keeps the given         mathematical structure exactly the same during learning; in other words, training is done so that the network follows a predetermined         trajectory. Numerical computer simulation results are provided to support this approach.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Yongguang Zhang1 | Masanori Sugisaka2 | Chenmei Xu1</authors><title>A new look at metabolism-repair systems&amp;#8212;a living system on screen      </title><content>The cell is the basic form of living system.

A PFNN consists         of a set of if-then rules with appropriate membership functions (MFs) whose parameters are optimized via a hybrid genetic         algorithm. A polynomial neural network is employed in the defuzzification scheme to improve output performance and to select         appropriate rules. A performance criterion for model selection is defined to overcome the overfitting problem in the modeling         procedure. For a performance assessment of the PFNN inference system, two well-known problems are employed for a comparison         with other methods. The results of these comparisons show that the PFNN inference system out-performs the other methods and         exhibits robustness characteristics.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>K.

In this paper, we assume simple robots         with a drive system and the simplest means of interaction, and examine the collective behavior through the task of gathering         pucks in a field. The efficiency of group behavior is evaluated by the relation between the number of robots and the task         completion time. To evaluate the efficiency of group behavior, we measure the exponent &amp;#946;, which is obtained from the scaling         relation between the task completion time and the number of robots. The effectiveness of group behavior is investigated for         fractal distributions of pucks. We research their behavior for fractal distributions of pucks and find out that the optimum         value of &amp;#946; depends on the dimension of the puck distributions.

The linearization is carried out by a learning process based on a Kohonen-style self-organization         network.

The adjusting of the weights and parameters of the network minimizes the performance measureP that is the sum of the squared errors between the target position on the screen and the center of the screen over an entire         trajectory of the target. Every adjustment of a single weight requires the evaluation of the performance measure over the         fixed target trajectory.

First, the trajectory of the waist is expressed by a Fourier series, where the bases are         selected appropriately so that the periodic boundary conditions are strictly satisfied. A biped locomotion machine establishes         optimal walking by using kicking forces to the ground at the moment of switching legs. In order to include the effecs of the         kicking forces, additional terms that indicate the impulsive forces at the moment of switching legs are included in the formulation.         Then the angles of each joint are determined by inverse kinematics, and using inverse dynamics, the input torques of each         joint are expressed in terms of Fourier coefficients. By defining the performance index as a quadratic form of the input torques,         the motion planning problem is formulated as an optimization problem of the trajectory of the waist, whose paramaters are         Fourier coefficients of the trajactory of the waist. Using the successive quadratic programming (SQP) method, the optimal         trajectory of a biped locomotion machine is obtained.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Tae-Seok Jin1  | Jang-Myung Lee1</authors><title>A study on the optimal path of a mobile robot based on mobility and recurrency      </title><content>In this article, we define mobility and recurrency, and acquire the desired mobility and recurrency which result from the         dynamic space change between two wheels of a mobile robot, assuming that the robot has a fixed wheel radius. When a robot         has a fixed interval between its two wheels, it cannot avoid a sudden, obstacle because of the constraints of mobility and         recurrency. The focus of this article is on instant recurrency, but high, stable mobility. That is, by changing the space         between the two wheels in the simulation, the mobile robot could gain high recurrency instantly, and also high mobility with         stability. We supposed that mobility and recurrency, as defined in this article, are applied to the design of a mobile robot.         We suggest a theoretical change based on the optimal design of a mobile robot. The experimental data support the validity         of this definition of mobility and recurrency.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Takeshi Tateyama1 | Seiichi Kawata1 | Toshiki Oguchi1</authors><title>A teaching method using a self-organizing map for reinforcement learning      </title><content>We described a new preteaching method for re-inforcement learning using a self-organizing map (SOM).

In our proposed method, the SOM is used         to generate the initial teaching data for the reinforcement learning agent from a small amount of teaching data. The reinforcement         learning function of the agent is initialized by using the teaching data generated by the SOM in order to increase the probability         of selecting the optimal actions it estimates. Because the agent can get high rewards from the start of reinforcement learning,         it is expected that the learning rate will increase.

The standard occupancy grid         mapping developed by Elfes and Moravec in the mid-1980s decomposes the high-dimensional mapping problem into many one-dimensional         estimation problems, which are then tackled independently. Because of the independencies between neighboring grid cells, this         often generates maps that are inconsistent with the sensor data. To overcome this, we propose a cluster that is a set of cells.         The cells in the clusters are tackled dependently with another occupancy grid mapping with an expectation maximization (EM)         algorithm. The occupancy grid mapping with an EM algorithm yields more consistent maps, especially in the cluster. As we use         the mapping algorithm adaptively with clusters according to the sensor measurements, our mapping algorithm is faster and more         accurate than previous mapping algorithms.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Masanori Otsuka1 </authors><title>Advances in brain research and the future of artificially assisted neural functions      </title><content>In this paper, I give a brief explanation of how the brain works, and present my ideas about how experts on artificial life         and robotics can contribute to brain science.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Keiki Takadama1| 3 | Hiroyasu Inoue2| Katsunori Shimohara3| Michio Okada4 | Osamu Katai2</authors><title>Agent architecture based on an interactive self-reflection classifier system      </title><content>This paper extends the learning classifier system (LCS) to introduce a mechanism for recognizing a current situation by determining         a boundary between self and others, and investigates its capability through interaction with an agent.

We start from the assumption that the evolutionary force is intrinsic in the living         system, and is in reality a continuous senescence function leading gradually and unavoidably to death. We are therefore seeking         a senescence function that favors social rather than solitary agents in terms of longevity, without prespecifying in detail         the agent's life span. We show that a senescence function relyling on negative (destructive) feedback links from metabolism         to genetic program conforms with these specifications. We also show that senescence should affect all the regulation parameters         of the agent, and that the system remains nonmanipulable and unpredictable as far as its life span is concerned. This senescence         function favors the more &amp;#8220;cognitive&amp;#8221; agent models (the ones having additional regulation loops), and thus the emergence of         organizations of a higher order that have more elaborate social relations.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>C.

Conventional algorithms have many problems         when applied in object tracking. The proposed active contour algorithm, a model using an edge of an adapted color feature,         not only modifies the internal energy function of the conventional algorithm to extend the search range and reduce the computational         burden, but also modifies the external energy function to reduce the edge candidates of the object. The algorithm searches         normally and uses dynamic programming to solve the energy minimization problem. The main drawbacks of a conventional snake         algorithm, i.e., shrinking, a limited search range, sensitivity to outliers, are improved with the proposed algorithm.

This memory system treats &amp;#8220;images&amp;#8221; as basic units of information, and adapts to the environment of the external world by means         of autonomous reactions between the images. The images do not have to be clear, distinct symbols or patterns; they can be         ambiguous, indistinct symbols or patterns as well. This memory system is a kind of neural network made up of nodes and links         called a localist spreading activation network. Each node holds one image in a localist manner. Images in high-activity nodes         interact autonomously and generate new images and links.

When environmental changes are inspected, the autonomous agent can adapt its cognition         structure to the new environment so that cognition can be achieved with great efficiency. After a description of the dynamic         structure and the principle of the structure&amp;#8217;s self-organization, some experiments illustrating how the architecture works         are described and discussed.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>S.

First, the system design process is reformulated         in the framework of set and mapping theory, and the design problem is defined as an inverse mapping from the set of specifications         depending on the environment to the set of components and their connections. The inverse problem can be solved by the iteration         of forward mapping. Next, the problem is classified from the viewpoint of the specifications and the environment. The concepts         of evolution, adaptation, learning, and coordination can be related to classified problems. Emergent design procedure is defined         in the framework of these concepts, in particular by taking evolutionary computing techniques into account. Two examples are         shown: the first is a design of complex linear passive filters, and the other is a design of multilink moving robots.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>R. G. Palmer1 | W. Brian Arthur2| John H. Holl|3 | Blake LeBaron4</authors><title>An artificial stock market      </title><content>The Santa Fe Artificial Stock Market consists of a central computational market and a number of artificially intelligent agents.         The agents choose between investing in a stock and leaving their money in the bank, which pays a fixed interest rate. The         stock pays a stochastic dividend and has a price which fluctuates according to agent demand. The agents make their investment         decisions by attempting to forecast the future return on the stock, using genetic algorithms to generate, test, and evolve         predictive rules. The artificial market shows two distinct regimes of behavior, depending on parameter settings and initial         conditions. One regime corresponds to the theoretically predicted rational expectations behavior, with low overall trading         volume, uncorrelated price series, and no possibility of technical trading. The other regime is more complex, and corresponds         to realistic market behavior, with high trading volume, high intermittent volatility (including GARCH behavior), bubbles and         crashes, and the presence of technical trading. One parameter that can be used to control the regime is the exploration rate,         which governs how rapidly the agents explore new hypotheses with their genetic algorithms. At a low exploration rate the market         settles into the rational expectations equilibrium. At a high exploration rate it falls into the more realistic complex regime.         The transition is fairly sharp, but close to the boundary the outcome depends on the agents&amp;#8217; initial &amp;#8220;beliefs&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;if they believe         in rational expectations they occur and are a local attractor; otherwise the market evolves into the complex regime.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Jian-Qin Liu1| 2  | Katsunori Shimohara1</authors><title>An evolvable proteomic computing method for robust artificial chemistry systems      </title><content>This paper proposes a novel computational model based on proteomic computing and leading to the construction of a robust artificial         chemistry system. the dynamic description for pathways, the evolutionary mechanism, and the robustness are discussed.

When the magnitude of the         chronicity of an immune cell is too high or too low, the cell does not respond to the antigens. The cell may attack an antigen         only when the magnitude of its chronicity is within a certain range. The activity of the system is also controlled by two         kinds of cytokines, a positive cytokine which activates immune cells, and a negative cytokine which reduces the activity of         immune cells. The system consists of immune cells, antigens, positive cytokines, and negative cytokines. The generation and         destruction of these elements and the interactions between them are considered based on a cellular automations model. The         model provides a unified view of the mechanism by which tolerance and memory are generated.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>K. Akimoto1 | S.

Most walking         robots proposed to date can walk in limited environments in which gait patterns are kinematically but not dynamically determined         in advance. This means that such robots cannot walk and adapt to changes in the world, while animals can walk flexibly and         efficiently in the real world. It has been considered that flexibility and efficiency in animals originate in the pattern         of emergence of control information. We have already clarified the mechanism of flexible and efficient generation of gait         patterns in animals, so we have tried to make an insect robot based on these mechanisms which can walk and adapt to unpredictable         changes in the environment. Since these mechanisms are quite new and are also applicable to other artificial systems, we discuss         the emergence system as the control mechanism attaining the target state under the constraints of the real world.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Toru Fujinaka1 | Michifumi Yoshioka1 | Sigeru Omatu1</authors><title>An intelligent approach to position control of a hard disk drive      </title><content>A new self-tuning neuro-proportional+integral+derivative (PID) controller is proposed and applied to position control of the         magnetic head in a hard disk drive.

As         the activation of each muscle is determined by a neural input, a neuromuscular system controlling all muscles has to be considered         in order to understand human movements. In this study, an optimal control model of a neuromuscular system is investigated,         and its control characteristics are examined. First, the dynamic and mechanical properties of a muscle are examined, and a         neuromuscular system is formulated mathematically. Second, a performance criterion for the optimal control model is defined         in order to characterize the dynamic behavior of the neuromuscular system, and a mathematical procedure for producing optimal         trajectories is represented. Third, optimal trajectories in human arm movements are produced under various conditions of movement,         and these trajectories are compared with experimentally observed ones. It is then verified that the optimal trajectories demonstrate         human arm movements well. Finally, the behavior of individual muscles in various movements is examined quantitatively by means         of simulation results, and the control characteristics of the human neuromuscular system are investigated.      </content></document><document><year>2006</year><authors>Mike Topping1 </authors><title>An overview of the development of Handy 1, a rehabilitation robot to assist the severely disabled      </title><content>The Handy 1 was developed in 1987 by Mike Topping to assist an 11-year-old boy with cerebral palsy to eat unaided.

Since the         proposed technique allows independent movement of the cameras employed, 3-D modeling under various environments, such as remote         places, can be realized. Our technique has an advantage over others in that camera calibration is not prerequisite to the         3-D modeling before taking images. A 3-D modeling system is described that captures images of remote objects, transfers the         images by analog airwaves, and recovers the 3-D shape of the object from the images. It is expected that this technique will         improve the efficiency of image information transfer.

This study was undertaken to         evaluate the validity of our fmEST algorithm in functional motif discovery for invertebrate EST sequence data. Out of 200         unidentified invertebrate ESTs, including 100 arthropod ESTs and 100 mollusk ESTs, 18 arthropod ESTs and 21 mollusk ESTs were         identified as fmESTs that contained functional motifs. The nucleotide lengths of arthropod fmEST and mollusk fmEST sequences         were distributed from 388 to 954&amp;#8201;bp and from 222 to 742&amp;#8201;bp, respectively. This result allowed us to annotate these invertebrate         fmESTs as various functional genes, while they showed no significant homology to the gene information recorded in the international         DNA databases using the conventional BLAST homology search program. In addition, another 1 arthropod EST and 23 mollusk ESTs         were assembled into contigs with any identified fmESTs by clustering alignment. Based on these findings, we have concluded         that our fmEST algorithm, involving the functional motif discovery procedure, is a valuable approach, enabling us to break         new ground in undeveloped invertebrate EST analysis.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Tomoharu Nakashima1 | Yasuyuki Yokota1| Yukio Shoji1 | Hisao Ishibuchi1</authors><title>A genetic approach to the design of autonomous agents for futures trading      </title><content>We propose a genetic algorithm-based method for designing an autonomous trader agent. The task of the proposed method is to         find an optimal set of fuzzy if&amp;#8211;then rules that best represents the behavior of a target trader agent. A highly profitable         trader agent is used as the target in the proposed genetic algorithm. A trading history for the target agent is obtained from         a series of futures trading. The antecedent part of fuzzy if&amp;#8211;then rules considers time-series data of spot prices, while the         consequent part indicates the order of trade (Buy, Sell, or No action) with its degree of certainty. The proposed method determines the antecedent part of fuzzy if&amp;#8211;then rules. The consequent         part of fuzzy if&amp;#8211;then rules is automatically determined from the trading history of the target trader agent. The autonomous         trader agent designed by the proposed genetic algorithm consists of a fixed number of fuzzy if&amp;#8211;then rules.

Accidents often happen when a person, a motorcycle,         a car, etc., comes out suddenly from a blind corner. In such a place, if the shielding objects become transparent, hidden         objects reveal themselves. This may contribute to preventing a lot of accidents. The proposed method creates a transparent         space by the employment of a mixed-reality technique and a simple three-dimensional (3-D) recovery technique. The 3-D virtual         space is created by a single camera image in real-time, and it is superposed onto a real space employing see-through vision.         The observer can watch a dynamic scene of the invisible space through the object in real-time. In the experiment performed,         an observer could watch persons walking around in a space hidden by an opaque partition. Future application of this technique         may include its installation at various corners in buildings or at intersections on roads with bad visibility. This would         surely contribute to reducing traffic accidents in future.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Mohd Saberi Mohamad1 | Sigeru Omatu2| Safaai Deris1 | Siti Zaiton Mohd Hashim1</authors><title>A model for gene selection and classification of gene expression data      </title><content>Gene expression data are expected to be of significant help in the development of efficient cancer diagnosis and classification         platforms.

It works adaptively according to the difference between individuals, and chronic         change of the patient&amp;#8217;s physiological state, and changes in the environmental conditions. Using the human thermal system of         the Stolwijk-Hardy model, the brain temperature is dynamically related to the ambient temperature of the head, trunk, and         extremities and their metabolic heat production. The dynamic characteristics of brain temperature under various physical conditions,         as examined by simulation experiments, provide improved understanding of clinical brain cooling treatment, which simultaneously         give good evidence for the validity of the model. The brain temperature is adaptively controlled in accordance with the appropriate         physiological state suggested by various clinical experiences. This kind of adaptive control system is useful for the practical         implementation of automatic hypothermia control in seriously injured or inflamed brain.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Hiroaki Tanaka1| 2  | Kazuyuki Aihara1| 2| 4</authors><title>Analysis of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations with noise: the effects of noise on chaotic neurodynamics      </title><content>The chaotic behavior of Hodgkin-Huxley equations modulated by noise was studied by power spectra, correlation exponents, and         information entropies by changing noise amplitude and components. The power spectra of the membrane potential calculated by         the equations showed two major peaks at 105 and 115 Hz. The noise component of compressing dynamics (CDN) enhanced the amplitude         of the 105 Hz component and also increased its frequency. The correlation exponent of the correlation integral, which was         calculated with a scale size below the noise amplitude, was almost the same as the degree of freedom of the system (=4) when         CDN was applied. Contrary to this, the noise component of extending dynamics (EDN) increased the exponent only up to 2.5&amp;#8211;3.0.         The information entropy shows that both CDN and EDN produced noise-induced order (NIO). The effect of EDN was slightly larger         than that of CDN. When comparing the effects of noise imposed on the variables of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations,V andm appeared to be related to CDN, whileh andn appeared to be related to EDN. These results suggest that the fluctuations induced by EDN were restricted within some parts         of submanifolds comprising the strange attractor, while those induced by CDN shook the orbit away from the submanifolds. This         shake-out mechanism may have a significant role on real neurodynamics.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Atsushi Shimada1 | Naoyuki Tsuruta2 | Rin-ichiro Taniguchi1</authors><title>Associative learning method in a hypercolumn model      </title><content>We propose an associatively learnable hypercolumn model (AHCM). A hyper-column model is a self-organized, competitive, and         hierarchical multilayer neural network. It is derived from the neocognitron by replacing each S cell and C cell with a two-layer         hierarchical self-organizing map. The HCM can recognize images with variant object size, position, orientation and spatial         resolution. However, feature maps may integrate some features extracted in the lower layer even if the features are extracted         from input data which belong to different categories. The learning algorithm of the HCM causes this problem because it is         an unsupervised learning used by a self-organizing map. An associative learning method is therefore introduced, which is derived         from the HCM by appending associative signals and associative weights to traditional input data and connection weights, respectively.         The AHCM was applied to hand-shape recognition. We found that the AHCM could generate an appropriate feature map and higher         recognition accuracy compared with the HCM.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Mokhtar Norrima1 | Masanori Sugisaka2 | Omar Rosli1</authors><title>Automatic motion detection for surveillance      </title><content>Automatic motion detection features are able to enhance surveillance efficiency and quality. The aim of this research is to         recognize and detect motion automatically around a robot's environment in order to equip a mobile robot for a surveillance         task. The required information is based on the input obtained from a charge coupled device (CCD) camera mounted on the mobile         robot. As the first step toward achieving the goal, it is necessary to have a stationary mobile robot and moving objects.         Experiments in a different environment, such as different movements, size of moving objects, and lighting conditions, have         also been conducted. The &amp;#8220;adjacent pixels comparison&amp;#8221; is the proposed method to detect motion in this experiment. The results         have verified that the motion detection experiments operate as expected.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Kantaro Fujiwara1  | Kazuyuki Aihara1| 2</authors><title>Classification of the spike sequences by distinguishing their sources of temporal correlations      </title><content>Irregular spike sequences of the cerebral cortex in vivo have been observed in numerous previous studies. These spike sequences         generally differ from an entirely random sequence, and exhibit temporal correlations. There are at least two possible sources         producing the temporal correlations: (1) temporal correlations of the incoming synaptic inputs; (2) a neuronal integration         mechanism. The temporal correlation of the neuronal output is produced by (1) or (2) or a mixture of these. In this article,         we propose an algorithm that distinguishes the sources of the temporal correlations of spike sequences. The statistical characteristics         of the spike sequences play a key role in this algorithm, which helps to classify the spike sequences by discriminating between         their sources of temporal correlations.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Hidetoshi Wakamatsu1 | Takuya Wakatsuki1 | Tomohiko Utsuki1</authors><title>Comparison of fuzzy control systems for hypothermal brain temperature regulation      </title><content>The automatic control system for brain tissue temperature is studied theoretically for brain hypothermia treatment.

The parameters relating the face emotions in each case are entirely different. All six universally         accepted emotions and one neutral are considered for each subject. Eyes and lips are usually considered as the features for         recognizing emotions. This paper has two parts. The first part investigates a set of image processing methods suitable for         recognizing face emotion. The acquired images have gone through a few preprocessing methods such as gray-scale, histogram         equalization, and filtering. The edge detection has to be sufficiently successful even when the light intensity is uneven.         So, to overcome this problem, the histogram-equalized image has been split into two regions of interest (ROI): the eye and         lip regions. The two regions have been applied with the same preprocessing methods, but with different threshold values. It         was found that the Sobel edge detection method performed very well in segmenting the image. Three feature extraction methods         are considered, and their respective performances are compared. The method which is fastest in extracting eye features is         adopted. The second part of the paper discusses the way to recognize emotions from eye features alone. Observation of various         emotions of the two subjects lead to an unique eye characteristic, that is, the eye exhibits ellipses of different parameters         in each emotion. The GA is adopted to optimize the ellipse characteristics of the eye features in each emotion based on an         ellipse-based fitness function. This has shown successful emotion classifications, and a comparison is made on the emotions         of each subject.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Shinichi Sagara1  | Yuichiro Taira2</authors><title>Digital tracking control of space robots using a transpose of the generalized Jacobian matrix      </title><content>We have proposed discrete time-control methods using the transpose of the generalized Jacobian matrix (GJM) for free-floating         space robots having manipulators.

Driver fatigue detection based on computer vision is one of         the most hopeful applications of image recognition technology. There are several factors that reflect driver's fatigue. Many         efforts have been made to develop fatigue monitoring, but most of them focus on only a single behavior, a feature of the eyes,         or a head motion, or mouth motion, etc. When fatigue monitoring is implemented on a real model, it is difficult to predict         the driver fatigue accurately or reliably based only on a single driver behavior. Additionally, the changes in a driver's         performance are more complicated and not reliable. In this article, we represent a model that simulates a space in a real         car. A web camera as a vision sensor is located to acquire video-images of the driver. Three typical characteristics of driver         fatigue are involved, pupil shape, eye blinking frequency, and yawn frequency. As the influences of these characteristics         on driver fatigue are quite different from each other, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA)-based neural network (NN) system         to fuse these three parameters. We use the GA to determine the structure of the neural network system. Finally, simulation         results show that the proposed fatigue monitoring system detects driver fatigue probability more exactly and robustly.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Peter Sapaty1 | Mosanori Sugisaka2| Robert Finkelstein3| Jose Delgado-Frias4 | Nikolay Mirenkov5</authors><title>Emergent societies: advanced IT support of crisis relief missions      </title><content>A novel distributed control ideology and technology is described for the management of advanced crisis relief missions.

By applying the division rule and the apoptosis rule, cell arrays duplicate in two oscillating states, i.e., self-replication         processes were observed. By applying a division rule and an annihilation rule, a cell array that has a stable length is generated         by changing the cell components, i.e., generating a cell array by a metabolic process was observed.

A         previous study demonstrated the possible potential utility of this approach while evolving controllers based on simulated         humanoid robots with a restricted range of movements. Although walking behaviors were developed, these were slow and relied         on the robot walking in an excessively stooped position, similar to the gait of an infirm elderly person. This article extends         the previous work to a robot with many degrees of freedom, up to 20 in total (arms, elbows, legs, hips, knees, etc.), and         demonstrates the automatic evolution of fully upright bipedal locomotion in a humanoid robot using an accurate physics simulator.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Hyeon Bae1 | Sungshin Kim1 | Man Hyung Lee2</authors><title>Extraction of quantitative and image information from flame images of steam boiler burners      </title><content>Several types of detector, such as ultraviolet, infrared, visible light, differential pressure, flame rod, and others, are         employed to detect fire flame in power generation plants.

Although several models have been proposed, their growth dynamics, and their interactions         with evolutionary algorithms are still poorly understood. One particularly neglected concept in artificial developmental systems         is heterochrony: how evolution affects development by changing the timing and rate of developmental events. In this article we attempt to         address this issue by analyzing heterochronic changes in a well-known artificial developmental model, the cellular encoding         model, by using a previously developed heterochrony framework. We have conducted experiments by evolving networks to solve         a Boolean problem, and analyzed heterochronic changes in both successful and unsuccessful runs. Our findings show that owing         to its properties, the cellular encoding model strongly affects the developmental dynamics and the heterochronic changes that         occur during evolution. Our experiments also show that hypermorphic changes (a kind of heterochronic occurrence) lead to greater         evolvability in successful runs.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Kazuyuki Morioka1 | Joo-Ho Lee2| Yoichi Kuroda3 | Hideki Hashimoto3</authors><title>Hybrid tracking based on color histogram for intelligent space      </title><content>The vision sensor network is expected to achieve a contact-free wide-area location system without any additional burden on         users in intelligent environments.

Intelligent reasoning, task-oriented behaviors, human-robot interfaces,         and communications add more tasks to be solved. This naturally leads to a complex hierarchical control system where various         tasks have to be processed concurrently. Many low-level tasks can be handled by a robot&amp;#8217;s onboard (host) computer. However,         other tasks, such as speech recognition or vision processing, are too computationally intensive for one computer to process.

We first constructed a model of the Elman         network with chaotic neurons that successfully learned the supervisor signal defined by a simple finite-state syntax. Second,         we focused on the process of individual-specific increases in the complexity of song syntax. We propose a new learning algorithm         to produce the intrinsic diversification of song syntax without a supervisor on the basis of the itinerant dynamics of chaotic         neural networks and the Hebbian learning rule. The emergence of novel syntax modifying the acquired syntax is demonstrated.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Shuhei Miyashita1 </authors><title>Morphogenesis of 3D sheets exploiting a spatial condition      </title><content>This article reports on the morphogenesis of three-dimensional folding sheets in a computer simulation.

A current research topic in distributed systems is self-monitoring to identify corrupted intrusion detection         systems. One way of self-monitoring is for intrusion detection systems to check each other. As we describe herein, this can         be done by mobile agents using an immunity-based diagnostic method modeled on idiotypic network theory. In simulations, the         credibility of normal intrusion detection systems remained near 1, while it fell to about 0 for corrupted intrusion detection         systems, thus enabling identification of the latter.

Then we used the GA with FP to select the &amp;#8220;significant frequencies&amp;#8221; and made a quality         evaluation rule to classify the good and defective products. For the frequency variation, we used the learning vector quantization         (LVQ) to evaluate the quality of transmission devices.

In this article, we present a method of improving the searching performance of the RGA. We propose         the use of biased probability distribution functions (BPDFs) based on the main and sub searching lines in the crossover process.         The crossover with BPDFs frequently produces offspring that are close to the best individuals in the current generation, and         it is highly likely that these offspring will offer the best solution to the problem.

After its introduction, this approach was further developed and led to many applications.         All of these approaches are based on Pareto ranking and use the fitness sharing function to keep diversity. On the other hand,         the scheme for solving MOPs presented by Nash introduced the notion of Nash equilibrium and aimed at solving MOPs that originated         from evolutionary game theory and economics. Since the concept of Nash Equilibrium was introduced, game theorists have attempted         to formalize aspects of the evolutionary equilibrium. Nash genetic algorithm (Nash GA) is the idea to bring together genetic         algorithms and Nash strategy. The aim of this algorithm is to find the Nash equilibrium through the genetic process. Another         central achievement of evolutionary game theory is the introduction of a method by which agents can play optimal strategies         in the absence of rationality. Through the process of Darwinian selection, a population of agents can evolve to an evolutionary         stable strategy (ESS). In this article, we find the ESS as a solution of MOPs using a coevolutionary algorithm based on evolutionary         game theory. By applying newly designed coevolutionary algorithms to several MOPs, we can confirm that evolutionary game theory         can be embodied by the coevolutionary algorithm and this coevolutionary algorithm can find optimal equilibrium points as solutions         for an MOP. We also show the optimization performance of the co-evolutionary algorithm based on evolutionary game theory by         applying this model to several MOPs and comparing the solutions with those of previous evolutionary optimization models.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Nobuaki Sugimine1| 2  | Kazuyuki Aihara1| 2</authors><title>Stability of an equilibrium state in a multiinfectious-type SIS model on a truncated network      </title><content>In a homogeneous constant population, the basic SIS model potentially has an epidemic equilibrium state with global asymptotic         stability since it can be reduced to the logistic equation.

A gas pressure transmission model based on the integrated pneumatic experiment system is         established. An experiment is done to prove the model's validity.

Since RL methods do not require an exact dynamics model of the controlled object, they have a higher flexibility and potential for adaptation to uncertain or nonstationary environments than methods based on traditional control theory. If the target system has a continuous state space whose dynamic characteristics are nonlinear, however, RL methods often suffer from unstable learning processes. For this reason, it is difficult to apply RL methods to control tasks in the real world. In order to overcome the disadvantage of RL methods, we propose an RL scheme combining multiple controllers, each of which is constructed based on traditional control theory.

The psychodynamic architecture is designed to develop automatically,         driven by &amp;#8220;pleasure&amp;#8221; coming from discharges of tension gathered in special tension-accumulating devices.

This study concerns         its feasibility through a simulation. First, a biothermal model is proposed for the adult incubating system based on the geometric structure and parameters of patients. Its dynamics were         carefully examined by two simulation experiments testing its step response and feedback control. Then a model reference adaptive         control algorithm was introduced for the automatic regulation of BTT, where the newly developed adult incubating biothermal model, represented by a state equation, was replaced for the hypothermic patient with a cooling blanket, thus introducing a first-order         lag system given as its basic characteristic model. Finally, the proposed cooling incubator was controlled by the adaptive control mechanism, which gives a follow-up of BTT         to a given reference temperature course, even if a possible environmental change in the therapeutic cooling system exists,         including the individual differences of patients and any chronic conditional change. The automatic cooling incubating system         based on the air-cooling method was confirmed to be superior to the water-cooling one. Thus, this work supports the possible         development of an air-cooling adult incubating system for the automatic regulation of BTT in an intensive care unit (ICU)         application.      </content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Wojciech Piaseczny1 | Hideaki Suzuki2 | Hidefumi Sawai3</authors><title>Chemical Genetic Programming &amp;#8211; evolutionary optimization of the genotype-to-phenotype translation set      </title><content>A new method of genetic programming, named chemical genetic programming (CGP), which enables evolutionary optimization of the mapping from genotypic strings to phenotypic trees is proposed.

Nishimura1 | Masaki Sasai2 </authors><title>Chemotaxis of a eukaryotic cell in complex gradients of chemoattractants</title><content>We studied the chemotaxis of a eukaryotic cell by constructing a mathematical model that takes into account chemical kinetics as well as the cellular shape. A cell is defined as a single domain on discrete two-dimensional grids. In the cellular domain each grid contains three kinds of molecule, an activator and inhibitor of the actin polymerization, and polymerized actins. The external signal promotes production of both activator and inhibitor and thus changes the amount of polymerized actins. If the amount of polymerized actins in a grid of the cell border (i.e., the cellular membrane) is larger than a certain threshold, then a new grid adjacent to the border is assigned to the cellular grid. Upon this change of the cellular shape, constraints are imposed to preserve the cellular volume and to make the length of the cellular border as small as possible. The cell moves in the grid space driven by this change of the cellular shape. We succeeded in reproducing chemotaxis in a linear gradient. For two more complex gradients, the behavior of our cell is consistent with experimental results.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Hirofumi Hirayama1| Toshihiro Itoh1 | Yoshihiko Nakaki1 | Takahiko Yoshida1</authors><title>Computational dynamics method for evaluating the mobility of charged biomolecules passing through the electrical potential field within the ion selective channel on an excitable membrane</title><content>A mathematical method is introduced to characterize the electrokinetic behavior (electrophoresis) of a biomolecular particle which passes through a specific channel pore on an excitable biological membrane. The basic approach was first proposed by Booth (1950). The system was described by an equation of continuity and an equation of motion in which the driving force involves the diffusion effect, the hydrostatic pressure, and the electrostatic potential. By assuming linear relations between the velocity and the applied electrical field, solutions for the potential, pressure, and velocity were given by a series expansion of the charges on the particle. To examine the influence of ions surrounding the particle and forming an ionic cloud, the Debye&amp;#x2013;Huckel parameter was introduced. As the thickness of the double layer around the particle increased, the potential, velocity, pressure, and viscosity were changed significantly. The maximum influence was obtained when the radius of the particle became equal to the thickness of the double layer. Although this theory is valid for a charged, spherical, nonconducting particle only, the method is available for evaluating the kinetic behavior of a biomolecule that passes through a channel pore on a cellular membrane.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Hidekazu Yanagimoto1  | Sigeru Omatu1</authors><title>Construction of a classifier using AdaBoost for information filtering</title><content>We describe an information filtering system using AdaBoost. To realize the filtering system, we created a user profile which presents the users interests. Since the users interests are complex, the user profile becomes a nonlinear discriminant function. However, it is difficult to decide on an appropriate discriminant function. We used AdaBoost to modify the appropriate user profile. AdaBoost is an ensemble algorithm which combines weak learners and improves the accuracy of a classifier. In this method, the weak learners for AdaBoost is a linear discriminant function which is created with a genetic algorithm. We carried out experiments for an information filtering service on an NTCIR2 test collection, and we discuss the effectiveness of the method.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Geoff Nitschke1 </authors><title>Designing emergent cooperation: a pursuit&amp;#8211;evasion game case study      </title><content>This research concerns a comparison of two neuroevolution approaches for the design of cooperative behavior in a group of         simulated mobile robots. The first approach, termed single pool (SP), was characterized by robot neural controllers that were         derived from a single genotype. The second approach, termed multiple pools (MP), was characterized by robot neural controllers         that were derived from many different genotypes. The application domain implemented a pursuit&amp;#8211;evasion game in which teams         of robots of various sizes, termed predators, collectively worked to capture (immobilize) other robots, termed prey. The MP         and SP approaches were tested, with and without lifetime learning, for the design of cooperative prey capture behavior within         teams of predators. Results indicated that the MP approach was superior to the SP approach in terms of measures defined for         prey-capture performance. Specifically, the MP approach facilitated behavioral specializations in the predator team facilitating         emergent cooperative prey capture strategies that proved effective for the various team sizes tested.      </content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Henrik Hautop Lund1  | Patrizia Marti2</authors><title>Designing manipulative technologies for children with different abilities      </title><content>We present a design approach for manipulative technologies that consider &amp;#8220;user diversity&amp;#8221; as a main lever for design. Different         dimensions of &amp;#8220;diversity&amp;#8221; are considered, e.g., the users' age, abilities, culture, cultural background, and alphabetization.         These dimensions drive the development of a user-centered design process for manipulative technologies for learning and play         environments. In particular, we explore the possibility of allowing young children to develop and interact with virtual/physical         worlds by manipulating physical objects in different contexts, like the classroom, the hospital, or the playground. In our         scenarios, we consider children with different abilities (fully able, physically impaired, or with cognitive delays), in different         cultures (Denmark, Tanzania, and Italy), and with a different level of alphabetization. The needs and expectations of such         heterogeneous user-groups are taken into account through a user-centered design process to define a concept of tangible media         for collaborative and distributed edutainment environments. The concept is implemented as a set of building blocks called         I-Blocks with individual processing and communication power. Using the I-Blocks system, children can do &amp;#8220;programming by building,&amp;#8221;         and thereby construct interacting artefacts in an intuitive manner without the need to learn and use traditional programming         languages.

The proposed controller is based on the specific immune response of the biological immune system that is cell-mediated immunity. Moreover, we designed and manufactured an AGV system for an automated container terminal (ACT), and some experiments are shown to verify the performance of the proposed controller. The tracking error of the AGV driving was investigated for this purpose. As a result, the capabilities of realization and reliability were proved by comparing the response characteristics of the proposed I-PID controllers with those of conventional PID and neural network PID (NNPID) controllers.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Seizaburo Niitsuma1  | Koshin Tokunaga1</authors><title>Edge detection and curvature calculation in the visual system</title><content>A new model of edge detection in a visual system is presented, where the edge locations are assumed to be at the place of negative peaks of &amp;#x25bf;2G&amp;#x2009;*&amp;#x2009;I.

The vibration spectrum is used to evaluate the MOET vibration. These vibration spectra are derived from 18 vibration data obtained by measurements on three different positions of a MOET. The spectra are then sent to the SOM network for the calculations. The vibration spectra are classified by the SOM, and calculations give the Euclidean distance from the weight vector in order to develop a quantitative evaluation. A statistic analysis of the Euclidean distance allows a quantitative evaluation of a MOET with respect to vibration stress and other relevant parameters.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Ivan Tanev1  | Thomas Ray2 </authors><title>Evolution of side-winding locomotion of simulated limbless, wheelless robots</title><content>Inspired by the efficient method of locomotion of the rattlesnake Crotalus cerastes, the objective of this work was the automatic design through genetic programming of the fastest possible, side-winding locomotion of simulated limbless, wheelless artifacts. The realism of the simulation is ensured by employing open dynamics engine (ODE), which allows accounting for all the physical forces resulting from the actuators (muscles), friction, gravity, collisions, and joint constraints. The empirically obtained results demonstrate that the complex side-winding locomotion emerges from relatively simple motion patterns of morphological segments (vertebrae). The robustness of automatically evolved locomotion is verified by (i) the reasonable performance degradation when partial damage to the artifact is inflicted, and (ii) the ability to tackle obstacles. Contributing to the better understanding of the unique, side-winding locomotion, this work could be considered as a step toward building real limbless, wheelless robots, featuring unique engineering characteristics, which are able to perform robustly in difficult environments.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Koichiro Yamauchi1 | Takayuki Oohira1 | Takashi Omori1</authors><title>Fast incremental learning methods inspired by biological learning behavior</title><content>Model-based learning systems such as neural networks usually &amp;#x201c;forget&amp;#x201d; learned skills due to incremental learning of new instances. This is because the modification of a parameter interferes with old memories. Therefore, to avoid forgetting, incremental learning processes in these learning systems must include relearning of old instances. The relearning process, however, is time-consuming. We present two types of incremental learning method designed to achieve quick adaptation with low resources. One approach is to use a sleep phase to provide time for learning. The other one involves a &amp;#x201c;meta-learning module&amp;#x201d; that acquires learning skills through experience.

The issues of preventive and condition-based maintenance, on-line monitoring, system fault detection, diagnosis, and prognosis are of increasing importance. This paper introduces fault detection for induction motors. Stator currents are measured by current meters and stored by time domain. The time domain is not suitable for representing current signals, so the frequency domain is applied to display signals. The Fourier transform is employed to convert signals. After signal conversion, signal features must be extracted by signal processing such as wavelet and spectrum analysis. Features are entered in a pattern classification model such as a neural network model, a polynomial neural network, or a fuzzy inference model. This paper describes fault detection results that use Fourier and wavelet analysis. This combined approach is very useful and powerful for detection signal features.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Ivan Tanev1| 2  | Katsunori Shimohara2| 3 </authors><title>Implications of the ability to learn simple actions on the efficiency of the evolution of social behavior of agents</title><content>We investigate the effect of the ability to learn simple actions on the performance characteristics of the evolution of social behavior in agents situated in an inherently cooperative environment. Using a continuous predator&amp;#x2013;prey pursuit problem, we verified that relatively complex social behavior emerges from simple, implicit, locally defined, and thus robust and scalable interactions between the predator agents. Considering a distinct aspect of the phenomenon of emergence, we hypothesize that the ability of agents to learn how to perform simple, atomic acts of implicit interaction might facilitate the evolution of more complex behavior. The empirical results indicate that incorporation of the proposed approach to learning in genetic programming (employed as an algorithmic paradigm to evolve the social behavior of the agents) is associated with about a two-fold decrease in the computational effort of evolution.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Takeru Yokoi1 | Hidekazu Yanagimoto1 | Sigeru Omatu1</authors><title>Information recommendation using ICA</title><content>We describe an information filtering system using independent component analysis (ICA). A document&amp;#x2013;word matrix is generally sparse and has an ambiguity of synonyms. To solve this problem, we propose a method to use document vectors represented by independent components. An independent component generated by ICA is considered as a topic. In practice, we map the document vectors into a topics space. Since some independent components are useless for recommendation, we select the necessary components from all independent components by a maximum distance algorithm (MDA). Although Euclidean distance is usually used by MDA, we propose topic selection by cosine-distance-based MDA to solve the mismatch of similarities in information filtering. We create a user profile from the transformed data with a genetic algorithm (GA). Finally, we recommend documents with the user profile and evaluate the accuracy by imputation precision. We have carried out an evaluation experiment to confirm the practicality of the proposed method.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Rolf Pfeifer1  | Gabriel G&amp;oacute mez1</authors><title>Interacting with the real world: design principles for intelligent systems</title><content>The last two decades in the field of artificial intelligence have clearly shown that true intelligence always requires the interaction of an agent with a real physical and social environment. The concept of embodiment that has been introduced to designate the modern approach to designing intelligence has far-reaching implications. Rather than studying computation alone, we must consider the interplay between morphology, materials, brain (control), and the environment. A number of case studies are presented, and it is demonstrated how artificial evolution and morphogenesis can be used to systematically investigate this interplay. Taking these ideas into account requires entirely novel ways of thinking, and often leads to surprising results.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Aneta Binder1 | Rudolf Freund1  | Marion Oswald1 </authors><title>Modelling artificial life by attributed eco-array grammars</title><content>For modelling agents and their actions, as well as their interactions with the environment, we propose eco-array grammars (multilevel n-dimensional parallel array grammars).

It is thought that mobility efficiency to a destination is improved by crawling over or striding         over obstacles. Moreover, if robots have many legs, like 4-legged or 6-legged types, then the robot's movement range is affected         by the order of the swing leg. In this article a neural network (NN) is used to determine the action of a quadruped robot         in an obstacle-avoiding situation by using information about the destination, the obstacle configuration, and the robot's         self-state. To acquire a free gait in static walking, the order of the swing leg is realized using an alternative NN whose         inputs are the amount of movement and the robot's self-state. The design parameters of the former NN are adjusted by a genetic         algorithm (GA) off-line.      </content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Henrik Hautop Lund1 | Thomas Klitbo2 | Carsten Jessen3</authors><title>Playware technology for physically activating play      </title><content>We present and use the robotic building block concept to create playware. Playware is the use of intelligent technology to         create the kinds of leisure activity we normally label play, i.e., intelligent hard- and software that aims at producing play         and playful experiences among users. The technological concept of physical building blocks with processing, input, and output         (including communication) is derived from embodied artificial intelligence that emphasizes the role of interplay between morphology         and control. We exemplify the building block concept with the tangible tiles that we created as components for a new kind         of playground on which children can experience immediate feedback on their motions. Hence, this kind of playground allows         the implementation of games and plays that demand physical activity amongst the users, and thereby contribute as a new tool         in the fight against obesity. The tangible tiles are homogenous building blocks, which gives assembly, substitution, and production         advantages. However, we may also create a system of heterogeneous building blocks, e.g., by adding special-purpose tiles such         as loud-speaker tiles. We performed tests with the tangible tiles placed at a school for 2 months' continuous use.      </content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Donat Orski1 </authors><title>Quality of cascade operations control based on uncertain variables</title><content>This article concerns a problem of control quality evaluation for a control plant composed of cascade operations.

The robot is assumed to have visual sensors around it. The recognition model is based on Kohonens self-organizing map (SOM), which was proposed as a model of the self-organization of a cortex. An ordinary SOM consists of a two-dimensional array of neuron-like feature detector units. We want to extract the direction and position information separately from the visual input, which is a function of the two information factors. Our model consists of two layers. The first layer is for directional information, and consists of units arranged in a circular array, and the second layer is for position information, and consists of a two-dimensional array. The units in the second layer accept inputs from all the units in the first layer through plastic inhibitory synapses. It will be shown by computer simulation that the units in the first layer develop direction sensitivity and lose position sensitivity through training, while in the second layer, the units develop position sensitivity and lose direction sensitivity.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>Naoya Sasano1| Katsutoshi Saeki2  | Yoshifumi Sekine2</authors><title>Short-term memory circuit using hardware ring neural networks</title><content>A number of studies have recently been made on various neuron models and neural networks.
