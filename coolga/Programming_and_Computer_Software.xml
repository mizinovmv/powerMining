Frolov1 </authors><title>A Hybrid Approach to Enhancing the Reliability of Software</title><content>Two approaches to enhancing the reliability and security of software&amp;#x2014;static analysis of the source code and dynamic protection&amp;#x2014;are compared. Advantages and disadvantages of these approaches are discussed. A hybrid approach to enhancing the reliability of software is suggested that combines advantages of both methods and smoothes over their drawbacks. A classification of dynamic protection systems is presented in terms of the time of their operation, abstraction level at which modifications are introduced and the protection code operates, and principles of protection. A pragmatic approach to the development and evolution of an algorithm for finding errors of a certain class in the source code that result in reducing the reliability or security of the system is described. The algorithm calculates an approximation of the exact solution (the set of dangerous fragments), and every next version of the algorithm improves the approximation to the exact solution. At each stage, the hybrid algorithm is used: when the static analysis cannot decide whether there are errors or not, the task of preventing the effects of possible errors is entrusted to the dynamic protection system. The iterative improvement of the algorithm has two purposes: to reduce the number of false alerts and to reduce the workload on the dynamic protection system. Application of the approach to a class of errors reducing the security of software is considered.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>S. V. Bakhanovich1  | N. A.

Recently, we have proposed a new algorithm for computing cohomology of Lie (super)algebras. This algorithm is based on splitting a complete cochain complex into minimal subcomplexes. The algorithm is implemented in C as a program LieCohomology. This paper presents results of computation of cohomology in a trivial module for a Lie algebra of Hamiltonian vector fields H(2|0). We demonstrate that the new approach is much more efficient than the traditional one. In particular, we have revealed some new cohomology classes for the H(2|0) algebra and the related Lie algebra of the Poisson vector fields Po(2|0).</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>V.

This approach is based on splitting a complete cochain complex into minimal (in some noninvariant sense) subcomplexes; this makes the computations much more efficient due to the fact that the proposed splitting allows the cochain complex spaces (which, normally, have very large dimensions) to be decomposed into much smaller subspaces. The algorithms in a pseudocode are presented. The approach is illustrated by comprehensive examples.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>V. V.

The original algorithm developed earlier by the author of this paper is based on the decomposition of the entire cochain complex into minimal subcomplexes. The suggested improvement consists in the replacement of the arithmetic of rational or integer numbers by a more efficient arithmetic of modular fields and the use of the relationship dim Hk(p)  dimHk() between the dimensions of cohomologies over an arbitrary modular field p = /p and the filed of rational numbers . This inequality allows us to rapidly find subcomplexes for which dimHk(p) &amp;gt; 0 (the number of such subcomplexes is usually not great) using computations over an arbitrary p and, then, carry out all required computations over  in these subcomplexes.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>R.

For certain scenes and shooting conditions, some algorithms give nice results, whereas others produce unacceptable results. In this paper, for a group of algorithms based on the matrix factorization, criteria are derived that make it possible, (a) by known statistical characteristics of the scene and shooting conditions, to predict whether a given algorithm can be used in the given case and, if it can, to determine the expected accuracy, (b) when recovering an unknown scene, to compute not only the desired results but also their accuracy (authenticity). A modification of the algorithm based on the adaptive selection of the approximation is suggested. Experimental verification of the criteria and estimates obtained showed their high efficiency and reliability.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>A. P.

A perturbation theory scheme is constructed that is based on an irreducible infinite-dimensional representation of algebra so(4, 2) of the group of dynamical symmetry for the hydrogen atom [1]. The scheme implementation does not rely on the assumption that the independent variables of the perturbation operator can be separated, and fractional powers of parabolic quantum numbers are not used in the recurrent relations determining the operation of algebra generators on the corresponding basis of the irreducible representation [2]. A seventh-order correction to the energy spectrum of the hydrogen atom in a uniform electric field is given. The algorithm suggested is implemented in REDUCE 3.6 [4].</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>A. V.

Royer1 </authors><title>An Operational Approach to the Semantics of Classes: Application to Type Checking</title><content>This paper presents a simple and natural semantics for object-oriented languages with classes and multiple inheritance. The model, called the Formal Class model, is an intermediate level between the algebraic specification of data type, and the implementation within an object-oriented language. Our model is equipped with an operational semantics based on conditional term rewriting. One important characteristic is the use of conditional selectors. It allows one to define a type with a flat or an ordered design. In this context, we define a safe and simple type system with single dispatch and simply covariant methods. This type system is extended to some practical aspects, such as abstract classes, abstract methods, protected methods, and super methods. We describe and compare flat and ordered designs and prove that the latter is finer than the former one. We also look at multicovariant methods and show ways to fix type-checking problems using single dispatch. We describe the least pessimistic solution. Lastly, we discuss the extension of our type checking to multiple dispatch and side effects. This paper synthesizes several practical results, their proofs, and algorithms.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>D. L.

A model of regular schemes is introduced in terms of which the transformations and their context conditions are formulated. In the class of regular schemes, a subclass of irredundant schemes, which correspond to program fragments without redundant calculations, is separated. For the irredundant schemes, the context conditions of the transformations for removal from loops and branch statements are formulated, which are simpler than the standard context conditions. Algorithms for the elimination of useless statements, unwinding of degenerate loops, and removal from loops and hammocks are described. The correctness of the algorithms constructed is noted, and estimates of the time and memory required for their operation are given. The algorithms are shown to be optimal in terms of the number of the transformations used: the algorithms of elimination of useless statements and unwinding of degenerate loops are optimal in the whole class of regular schemes, and the algorithm of removal from loops and hammocks is optimal in the class of irredundant schemes without degenerate subloops. The practical implementation of the algorithms constructed is described.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>G. Shukovich1 </authors><title>Application of Genetic Algorithms and Systems of Generating Graphs for Creation of Modular Neural Networks</title><content>There are many methods based on joint use of genetic algorithms and neural networks. In the majority of these methods, the architecture of the network and/or its weights are coded into chromosomes directly, which results in a huge number of chromosomes and increases their dimensions. From this point of view, methods based on coding rules that generate networks are highly promising. In this paper, a method of creation of architectures of modular neural networks based on the use of grammatical systems for fractal generation is considered. Genetic algorithms are used as an optimizer of the neural architectures obtained.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>F. Clauss1| 2  | I. Yu.

Although these packages are widely used, they have a number of limitations. In particular, they do not support multivariate polynomials with integer coefficients, which are often met in programs and used for the analysis of systems. Some methods to overcome this difficulty have already been suggested, but, unfortunately, they can be applied to only a subclass of such expressions. In this paper, we suggest a more general approach based on the Bernstein expansion, which facilitates the analysis of integer multivariate polynomials.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>V.

These are typically synchronized with several other simpler actuators along the pipeline of production. CNCs have to be flexible, easily expandable, and reusable, when pipelines of production are frequently reconfigured to realize different arranged pipelines with different technical requirements. In this paper, the assessment of a flexible CNC for such reconfigurable pipelines is presented. The analysis has been focused on defining objective metrics that can be applied for assessing performance and feasibility of distributed controls for pipelines. The method proposed has been applied on the distributed control architecture defined in the MUPAAC ESPRIT HPCN (Multi Processor Architecture for Automatic Control, High Performance Computer Networking of the European Commission). MUPAAC architecture and prototype has been assessed in order to identify the critical configurations and the limits of the architecture.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>D. Yu.

A new automated method for the construction of near-optimal object identification procedures is described. The objects to be identified can belong to several classes. The identification is based on reference images of those objects and uses a learning sample of images. The construction of the desired procedure assumes that it is selected from a set of procedures detecting the given object. This set is formed by the reference image of the object and uses algorithms of certain predefined types. The selection procedure is based on a genetic algorithm described in the paper.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>A. S. Kossatchev1| P. Kutter2  | M. A.

The technique makes it possible to generate tests correct from the dynamic semantics standpoint that do not depend on specific features (undefined or implementation-specific) of the semantics (the so-called strictly conforming tests). The application of the suggested technique to generating tests for C compilers is discussed in detail. For this purpose, a subset of C is defined the semantics of which, first, does not depend on the above-mentioned specific features and, second, possesses properties of type soundness and determinism, which guarantee the correct test execution for any implementation satisfying the C standard.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>S. K. Chernonozhkin1 </authors><title>Automated Test Generation and Static Analysis</title><content>The study and development of techniques for automated generation of useful tests, the development of a system that implements those techniques, and the development of methods for the analysis of programs designed for solving this problem are based on the earlier works of the author of the present paper, the works by B. Korel, and on the desire to understand if the approaches suggested can be used to develop real-world software. The first problem is as follows: determine, which information on the program must be collected to automatically generate a set of tests, and develop a component for collecting this information. The emphasis was made on collecting this information statically using a powerful flow analyzer developed in a laboratory of the Institute of Information Systems. Another problem consists in developing a prototype system for trying both well-known and new test generation methods suggested by the author. As a result, path-oriented and objective-oriented methods of test generation and the chaining approach (which turned out to be the most interesting one) are considered. This approach uses the concept of influence of an input variable on an operator along a certain program execution path and is based on dynamic analysis. The concept of influence can be extended for the case of all paths; then, such influences can be detected statically. In this paper, the influence along any path is rigorously defined and its constructive flow reformulation is given. On the basis of this reformulation, a language processor is developed that performs a static analysis of dependencies and calculates, for every statement of the program, the set of input variables that influence it.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>S.

These methods are used to numerically solve the light energy transport equation (the rendering equation). Stochastic methods are used because the integration is performed in a high-dimensional space, and the convergence rate of the Monte Carlo methods is independent of the dimension. Nevertheless, modern studies are focused on quasi-random samples that depend on the dimension of the integration space and make it possible to achieve, under certain conditions, a high rate of convergence, which is necessary for interactive applications. In this paper, an approach to the development of an algorithm for the bidirectional ray tracing is suggested that reduces the overheads of the quasi-Monte Carlo integration caused by the high effective dimension and discontinuity of the integrand in the rendering equation. The pseudorandom and quasi-random integration methods are compared using the rendering equations that have analytical solutions.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>L. G.

In view of the fact that properties and functional characteristics of the XML documents considerably differ from those of data of other type, the solutions of a number of typical data management problems (such as the XML data validation, schema inference, and data translation to/from other models) for them are more complicated. The general idea of our approach to solving these problems is to transform the original structure (i.e., structural schema constraints) into another structure without loss of information about properties of the original data that are important for applications. The suggested technique has been successfully used in various algorithms for solving problems of this kind. In this paper, a systematic approach to solving these problems is discussed. Methods for reducing the XML schemas to several canonical forms are presented, and algorithms of solving the management problems for data satisfying schemas represented in the canonical forms are examined.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>V.

Operations on multilabeled Petri nets&amp;#x2014;parallel composition and restriction&amp;#x2014;are defined. A definition of a Petri net entity is given based on the notion of multilabels. A Petri net entity is a Petri net with a set of multilabels, where each multilabel is regarded as an access point of the entity. The operation of entity composition is introduced.

Bocharov1 </authors><title>Concurrent Programming Technologies and Techniques</title><content>Intensive use of computer experiments in modern science introduces qualitative changes into experimental resources. This implies the change in techniques used to solve relevant problems. An analysis of technological chains (from the problem statement to its solution) shows that often a particular problem can be solved in a variety of ways with the use of modern multiprocessor computers, which are also called supercomputers. The multiplicity of approaches to solving a problem requires that researches possess certain skills in using supercomputers. It is difficult for novice users of multiprocessor computers to find bearings when developing software for solving applied problems. The practice shows that main difficulties reveal themselves when it is required to develop portable and efficient parallel software. This is because tools that facilitate the development and provide full access to debugging information have yet to be elaborated. Actually, the problem is in the absence of standards for development and debugging tools for supercomputers, which is explained by the fact that computer science is yet young. For the same reason, no logically complete basic texts for concurrent programming courses for novices are available. On the basis of Russian-language literature, an attempt is made at setting up beacons that mark certain common and promising technologies in using supercomputers. The emphasis is made on problems encountered by programmers when solving applied problems with the use of supercomputers. The development of multiprocessor computers is closely related to concurrent programming technologies, both universal and oriented to specific supercomputer architectures. By programming technology, i.e., by memory management, we mean the use of tools designed for managing a particular computer system. It should be noted that when developing software for supercomputers (both management software and programs for solving applied problems), one must pay special attention to programming technique, i.e., to designing the logical architecture of a program. This implies the development and extending parallelizing algorithms, which enhances the efficiency of execution on multiprocessor computers. This review was compiled on the basis of publications in Russian journals and in the Russian Internet zone.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>A. S.

The basic idea of the approach is to replace the standard double type by a special class number, which supports basic operations on numbers (arithmetic, input/output) and constructs the graph in a background mode. A class graph is responsible for general control of the graph construction process. Classes vector and matrix are introduced to support the construction of the graph for vector and matrix operations. The library of classes developed is a powerful and flexible tool for analysis of the algorithm graphs.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>V. V.

A special feature of the language is a nonconventional definition of the object type that can be used simultaneously as the description of a syntax class. Objects in a program are represented (denoted) as character strings that follow the grammatical rules given in the definitions of types. In the case of a compiler, for example, the object&amp;#x2013;program is represented by the source file itself. The availability of a constructor in the language makes it possible to generate objects while the program is running from components&amp;#x2013;subobjects given either by variable values or in the form of representations.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>V.

Theoretical issues concerning the design of aircraft involving large amounts of computations are also examined. This paper is focused on theoretical issues of paralleling available methods and algorithms for solving complex integro-differential systems of equations. A number of paralleling methods are considered based on various types of decomposition of the original problem into several subproblems that can be solved concurrently (decomposition by physicomathematical processes of the technological chain of computations and by the corresponding processes that can be performed concurrently (horizontal paralleling), and decomposition by the computational geometric domains and by the corresponding processes that can be performed concurrently (vertical paralleling)). The efficiency of these methods is compared and the optimal paralleling method is found. The results of the theoretical study are used in developing the third-generation package of programs for solving aerodynamics and gas dynamics problems called Potok-3.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>Li Chunlin1| 2 | Lu Zhengding1 | Li Layuan2</authors><title>Design and Implementation of a Hybrid Agent Platform</title><content>This paper presents IMAP, a hybrid agent platform composed of several cooperating intelligent agents and mobile agents. IMAP is implemented in Java and Prolog. Java is used to implement the framework of the system, and in particular for supporting the communication between agents and mobility of agent, while Prolog is used to implement both adduction and derivation mechanisms. IMAP intends to independently employ the underlying derivation/adduction and mobility mechanism. In IMAP, intelligent agent and mobile agent can not only fully exploit individual virtue, but also cooperate to perform a task under a uniform platform. Intelligent agents in IMAP are equipped with hypothetical reasoning capabilities, performed by means of adduction: if the knowledge available to an agent is insufficient to solve a query, the agent could adduce new hypotheses. Each intelligent agent can accept queries from mobile agents by means of the interface module, each query is passed to the reasoning module of intelligent agent which performs a derivation and adduction in order to get an answer for mobile agent. IMAP also provides mobile agents a flexible and efficient coordination mechanism and a reliable migration mechanism, and supports persistence of agent state and agent security. Mobile agent's coordination mechanism exploits the advantages of the XML language and Linda-like coordination. This programmable Linda-like coordination mechanism suits the mobility and openness of the Internet application, XML standard for Internet data representation may guarantee a high-degree of interoperability between heterogeneous environments. The design and implementation key technologies of IMAP are described in this paper. An Internet based auction application example shows the suitability and the effectiveness of the IMAP, and its performance evaluation is also made. Finally, some conclusions and remarks are given.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>A. V. Niukkanen1  | P. A.

A data file is represented as a set of nparts, each of size 1/kof the source file, so that the source file can be generated from any kparts (kn). The cardinality of the set may vary by constructing new (or by deleting the existing) parts, i.e., without modifying the existing parts, so that the source file can still be generated from any kparts. The file partitioning and assembly algorithms are based on the theory of finite Galois fields GF. A file is represented as a sequence of k-dimensional vectors over a GF. Every fragment is a sequence of projections of these vectors onto a k-dimensional vector (chosen for the given fragment) over the GF. In the paper, several implementations of the model are presented. For each of these implementations, the results of performance on the Celeron-450 processor are obtained and analyzed to determine their range of application.</content></document><document><year>2004</year><authors>R.

The concept of monomial ordering         plays the key role in the theory of GrГ¶bner bases: every basis is determined by a certain ordering. At the same time, in order         to define a GrГ¶bner basis, it is not necessary to know ordering of all monomials. Instead, it is sufficient to know only a         finite interval of the given ordering. We consider combinatorics of finite monomial orderings and its relationship with cells         of a universal GrГ¶bner basis. For every considered class of orderings (weakly admissible, convex, and admissible), an algorithm         for enumerating finite orderings is discussed and combinatorial integer sequences are obtained. An algorithm for computing         all minimal finite orderings for an arbitrary GrГ¶bner basis that completely determine this basis is presented. The paper presents         also an algorithm for computing an extended universal GrГ¶bner basis for an arbitrary zero-dimensional ideal.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>V.

The internal representation of the SPMD program         model is described, which is constructed so as to place as much of the interpretation work of a parallel Java program on JavaVM.         Features of the model generation and its preparation to the interpretation are described. The model generator transforms the         abstract syntax tree of each method of the program being simulated into a model of the control flow, forms a computation model         that will be executed on JavaVM, and forms a module for evaluating the execution times of the basic blocks. The interpretation         of the model executed on p nodes of a parallel computing system (cluster) is performed in p logical processes of which each         is executed in an individual thread. The interpretation of a logical process assumes that all its methods beginning from the         main method are interpreted. The interpretation of each method consists in executing the computation model of this method         on JavaVM. The order of interpretation of the method&amp;#8217;s basic blocks is determined by the system interpreter of the method&amp;#8217;s         model. The system makes it possible to reduce parts of the model and interpret the model by parts. Problems of the simulation         and interpretation of communication functions are discussed. The communication functions are described using nine basic exchange         operations. To evaluate the time needed to transfer data between processes, an empirical dependence between the amount of         the transferred data and the transfer time is used, which is obtained using tests. A short description of the ParJava graphical         interface is presented. Applications developed using the proposed implementation of the system are platform independent; and         the development, tuning, and maintenance overheads for those applications are considerably reduced. This is a contribution         to the development of high-productive parallel applications.      </content></document><document><year>2009</year><authors>P. P.

The method is based on an estimate         of the static error of a quad tree nodes using wavelet transforms and on the representation of the resulting quad tree by         a vertex texture. The proposed method has the following characteristic features: the adjacent nodes of the generated adapted         mesh can differ in any number of hierarchical levels; the triangulation process is not limited by the size of the decomposition         segments, which solves the problem of joining segments without inserting additional nodes; the multiscale terrain representation         used in the method makes it possible to store the levels of detail in the graphics processor memory as a multilevel vertex         texture; thus, the costliest part of the algorithm can be efficiently implemented using a vertex shader.

Such an expedient, which is called speculative execution, helps to reveal parallelism at the instruction level. In the EPIC         architectures, the speculative execution is completely controlled by the compiler, which makes it possible to avoid using         complex hardware mechanisms for supporting speculative instruction production. Moreover, the idea of the speculative execution         can be used by the compiler in machine-independent optimizations. The paper describes a scheme of construction of the speculative         optimization that is based on the selection of properties of the control flow and data flow that are important from the optimization         standpoint and on the estimation of the probabilities of their fulfillment. The probabilities found are used for searching         and constructing advantageous speculative and bookkeeping transformations. For optimizations that include only speculative         movements of instructions upwards along the control flow graph, on the basis of the suggested scheme, a method has been developed         that includes algorithms for finding probabilities of data and control dependences, for estimating benefit of speculative         movements, and for constructing a recovery code. On the basis of this method, an algorithm for the speculative scheduling         of instructions for the Intel Itanium architecture has been developed and implemented. Specific features of its implementation         and experimental results are described.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>A. A.

Schema evolution can be applied to mapping-related         evolving schemas (such as schemas of XML-relational systems), the transformation problem for which is also known as schema         adaptation. In this paper, a survey of various approaches to solving the outlined problems is given.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>V. V.

Universal         specific features of deterministic dynamical system behavior associated with nontrivial symmetries of these systems are specified.         Group nature of soliton-like moving structures of the &amp;#8220;spaceship&amp;#8221; type in cellular automata is revealed. Study of lattice         models is also considerably simplified when their symmetry groups are taken into account. A program in C for group analysis         of systems of both types is developed. The program, in particular, constructs and investigates phase portraits of discrete         dynamical systems modulo symmetry group and seeks dynamical systems possessing special features, such as, for example, reversibility.         For mesoscopic lattice models, the program computes microcanonical distributions and looks for phase transitions. Some computational         results and observations are presented.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>D. V. Koznov1  | K. Yu.

Unfortunately, the number of the processors that we can use is small (from 2 to 16) because of hardware constraints.         This paper presents a program for distributed computation of bases that relies on the same principles but works in a network         consisting of heterogeneous machines. The effectiveness of such an approach is estimated from the standpoint of the processor         capacity usage and the required network bandwidth, and methods optimizing usage of these resources are specified.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>V.

It is based on generation of correctness conditions. In the structured         deterministic case, the problem of generation of correctness conditions seems trivial, since it is solved by a syntax-driven         algorithm, the complexity of which linearly depends on the number of control constructs. Vice versa, in the unstructured nondeterministic         case, it seems a priori clear that the complexity of generation of the correctness conditions exponentially depends on the         number of statements in the program. In the paper, an efficient and complete algorithm for the generation of the correctness         conditions is presented and justified. It can be used both in the structured deterministic and unstructured nondeterministic         cases. The algorithm complexity linearly depends on the number of control constructs and/or program statements.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>S. A. Abramov1| 2 | M. V.

Most often, a DBMS is supposed to work in an exclusive mode of operation. However, in the class of x86-based multiprocessor         computing systems designed for mass usage, the exclusive mode of DBMS operation with respect to other software is often not         secured. In addition, the legacy software for this class of computing systems is often not designed for mass parallel usage.         When the exclusive mode requirement is ignored and the resources of the computing system are not used in low-load DBMS regimes,         the efficiency of using resources of the computing system as a whole reduces. This paper considers a method of program organization         of controlled parallelism at the level of internal DBMS operations, allowing for their controlled execution based on the state         of the entire computing system. This method made it possible to significantly reduce the time of response for low densities         of query arrival in the ODB-Jupiter commercial object DBMS developed in the Inteltec Plus scientific manufacturing center.         The method of controlled parallel execution can be used in a wide class of program systems.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>R. I.

At the same time, when working with high-dimensional tensor quantities,         direct use of standard functions for calculating GrГ¶bner bases, which are built in computer algebra systems Maple and Mathematica, requires much memory. However, being multilinear forms, tensors admit special grading that makes it possible to classify         polynomials in terms of their degree of homogeneity. With regard to this feature, we propose to use a special homogeneous         GrГ¶bner basis, which allows us to avoid difficulties associated with large amount of computation. Such a basis is constructed         step by step, as the degree of the polynomial grows. As an example, an algorithm for constructing the homogeneous basis in         a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian system with many polynomial constraints (the so-called Yang-Mills mechanics) is presented.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>A.

It can be used jointly with region growing         algorithms. Segmentation of small objects in color images is a difficult problem because their boundaries are close to each         other. The proposed algorithm accurately determines the location of the boundary points of closely located small objects and         finds the skeletons (seed regions) of those objects. The method makes use of conditions obtained by analyzing the change of         color characteristics of the edge pixels along the direction that is orthogonal to the boundaries of adjacent objects. These         conditions are generalized for the case of the well-known class of color images having misregistration artifacts. If high-quality         seed regions are available, the final segmentation can be performed using one of the region growing methods. The segmentation         algorithm based on the proposed method was tested using a large number of color images, and it proved to be very efficient.      </content></document><document><year>2008</year><authors>I.

The algorithm is implemented as a package of programs in Maple-Fortran and is         used for the reduction of a singular two-dimensional boundary value problem for the elliptic second-order partial differential         equation to a regular boundary value problem for a system of second-order ordinary differential equations using the Kantorovich         method.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>V.

The notion of distance on strings is important in the problem         of inductive learning related to artificial intelligence, in cryptography, and in some other fields of mathematics. The distance         is defined as a minimum length of the transformation path that transforms one string into another. One example is the Levenstein         distance, with the transformations being insertions, deletions, and substitutions of letters. A quadratic algorithm for calculating         this distance is known to exist. In this paper, a more general case&amp;#8212;insertion and deletion of words of arbitrary length&amp;#8212;is         considered. For this case, the problem of distance calculation turns out to be unsolvable. The basic results of this work         are the formulation of the condition of computability of distance and the algorithm for distance calculation, which is polynomial         in string length.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>L.

The macrostructure of a website is understood as the structure of interrelations between its resources based on hyperlinks.         The approach presented involves inventorying information resources of the site, partial syntactic analysis of its HTML-files,         locating their hyperlinks, and, in so doing, reconstructing its macrostructure (the hyperlink graph of resources). The description         of the site's macrostructure is placed into a relational database and is analyzed by formal methods based on relational algebra         and graph theory in order to detect irrelevant (dangling) hyperlinks, resources to which no inner hyperlink points, as well         as hypertext pages unattainable from the homepage of the site. In the paper, the prospects of this approach are discussed         in relation to websites created with the help of XML technologies.

Kossatchev1  | V. V. Kuliamin1 </authors><title>Formalization of test experiments      </title><content>Formal methods for testing conformance of the system under examination to its specification are examined. The operational         interaction semantics is specified by a special testing machine that formally determines the testing capabilities. A set of         theoretically powerful and practically important capabilities is distinguished that can be reduced to the observation of external         actions and refusals (the absence of external actions). The novelties are as follows. (1) Parameterization of the semantics         by the families of observable and not observable refusals, which makes it possible to take into account various constraints         on the (correct) interactions. (2) Destruction as a forbidden action, which is possible but should not be performed in the         case of a correct interaction. (3) Modeling of the divergence by the &amp;#916;-action, which also should be avoided in the case of         a correct interaction. On the basis of this semantics, the concept of safe testing, the implementation safety hypothesis,         and the safe conformance relation are proposed. The safe conformance relation corresponds to the principle of independent         observations: a behavior of an implementation is correct or incorrect independently of its other possible behaviors. For a         more narrow class of interactions, another version of the semantics based on the ready traces may be used along with the corresponding         conformance relation. Some propositions concerning the relationships between the conformance relations under various semantics         are formulated. The completion transformation that solves the problem of the conformance relation reflexivity and a monotone         transformation that solves the monotonicity problem (preservation of the conformance under composition) are defined.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>D.

Its basic features are flexibility, extensibility, and powerful mechanism of description of complex behavior, which is based         on finite automata. The disadvantage of the state-based object-oriented programming is the lack of standard methods for designing         and implementing state-based classes. In this work, graphical notation for designing state-based classes, which combines capabilities         of the class diagrams of the object-oriented programming and behavior diagrams of the automata-based programming, is presented.         The proposed graphical notation makes it possible to generalize, decompose, structure, and incrementally extend logic of the         state-based classes by means of the inheritance.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>F.

However, those methodologies sometimes present a lack of formality that may undermine its use. In this paper         we formalize the semantics of associations. Firstly, we will describe an OO model based on different kinds of constraints.         Some of them will be especially useful for describing the semantics of associations.

An analysis of this class of distributed information systems is given.         The main effort is focused on the formalization of properties of the stored objects and operations, which makes it possible         to construct a formal model of digital libraries. This model can serve as a basis for designing development tools. Systems         based on this approach are called integrated information resource systems (IIRS). In particular, the information retrieval         system of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IIRS RAS) is based on these principles. The paper is organized as follows. First,         the aim of the paper is outlined. Then, the definition of a digital library is given (as it is understood by the authors),         basic concepts are discussed, and IIRS is considered as a digital library. The notion of the resource is introduced as the         basic object to be processed. Metadata and their role in the system of digital libraries are considered, as well as the role         of relationships and data organization. Then, the architecture and functional capabilities of IIRS are considered, and, in         particular, a metamodel of the system, data search, and the implementation of data distribution. The current implementation         of IIRS RAS is briefly outlined.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>Kh. D. Ikramov1  | N. V.

The discrete potential along with the missing eigenvalues is found by solving         a polynomial system of equations, which is derived and solved using the REDUCE computer algebra system. To ensure the convergence         of the iterative process implemented in the Numeric package in REDUCE, proper initial data must be specified. The prescribed         eigenvalues are perturbed original eigenvalues corresponding to the zero discrete potential. The original eigenvalues provide         the natural initial data for the corresponding missing eigenvalues. In the case of a square, there are many multiple eigenvalues         among the original eigenvalues. The direct application of the variant of the Newton method implemented in the Numeric package         in REDUCE is impossible in the case of multiple initial data. A modification of the method proposed earlier for calculating         the discrete potential of the two-dimensional discrete SchrГ¶dinger equation in a square is illustrated by an example.      </content></document><document><year>2007</year><authors>A.

A finite set with two numberings,         two order relations, and one symmetry relation is considered. An algorithm is proposed for partitioning this set into simple         parts determined by compositions of given relations. Each simple part of the set is then partitioned into layers. This model         can also be used for analyzing different data admitting similar formalization. It can be used for analyzing structure of some         graphs (in particular, graphs describing molecular associations). The proposed algorithms are used for partitioning a complex         family into simple ones determined by family relationships and for determining family generations. The algorithms can be applied         to analyzing corporations with a family-like structure.      </content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>V. A. Kostenko1  | E. S.

The colony can be regarded as a multi-agent system where each agent is functioning independently by simple rules. Unlike the nearly primitive behavior of the agents, the behavior of the whole system happens to be amazingly reasonable. The ant algorithms have been extensively studied by European researchers from the mid-1990s. These algorithms have successfully been applied to solving many complex combinatorial optimization problems, such as the traveling salesman problem, the vehicle routing problem, the problem of graph coloring, the quadratic assignment problem, the problem of network-traffic optimization, the job-shop scheduling problem, etc. The ant algorithms are especially efficient for online optimization of processes in distributed nonstationary systems (for example, telecommunication network routing).</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>A.

A covering path exists for any initial vertex only if the graph is strongly connected. The traversal of an unknown graph implies that the topology of the graph is not a priori known, and we learn it only in the course of traversing the graph. This is similar to the problem of traversing a maze by a robot in the case where the plan of the maze is not available. If the robot is a general-purpose computer without any limitations on the number of its states, then traversal algorithms with the estimate O(nm) are known, where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of arcs. If the number of states is finite, then this robot is a finite automaton. Such a robot is an analogue of the Turing machine, where the tape is replaced by a graph and the cells are assigned to the graph vertices and arcs. The selection of the arc that has not been traversed yet among those originating from the current vertex is determined by the order of the outgoing arcs, which is a priori specified for each vertex. The best known traversal algorithms for a finite robot are based on constructing the output directed spanning tree of the graph with the root at the initial vertex and traversing it with the aim to find all untraversed arcs. In doing so, we face the backtracking problem, which consists in searching for all vertices of the tree in the order inverse to their natural partial ordering, i.e., from the leaves to the root. Therefore, the upper estimate of the algorithms is different from the optimal estimate O(nm) by the number of steps required for the backtracking along the outgoing tree. The best known estimate O(nm + n2loglogn) has been suggested by the author in the previous paper [1]. In this paper, a finite robot is suggested that performs a backtracking with the estimate O(n2log*(n)). The function log* is defined as an integer solution of the inequality 1  log2log*(n) t = log &amp;ordm; log &amp;ordm; ... &amp;ordm; log (the superposition &amp;ordm; is applied t &amp;#x2013; 1 times) is the tth compositional degree of the logarithm. The estimate O(nm + n2log*(n)) for the covering path length is valid for any strongly connected graph for a certain (unfortunately, not arbitrary) order of the outgoing arcs. Interestingly, such an order of the arcs can be marked by symbols of the finite robot traversing the graph. Hence, there exists a robot that traverses the graph twice: first traversal with the estimate O(nm + n2loglogn) and the second traversal with the estimate O(nm + n2log*(n)).</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>V.

A survey of the currently available methods for solving this problem is given, and the most promising among them from the standpoint of processing large arrays of documents are selected. Then, the methods selected are refined and modified, and, on the basis of these methods, a system for storing XML documents in an RDBMS is constructed. Finally, the performance of this system for each method considered is tested, and, by the results of these tests, an optimal relational schema is selected.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>A.

Directed sliced partitions are convenient for finding involutive divisors of an arbitrary monomial. It is proved that the only homothetic division that is simultaneously pairwise and directed sliced is the Janet involutive division. This shows that the Janet division is optimal for the calculation of multiplicative variables and for the fast search of a divisor.</content></document><document><year>2005</year><authors>V. V.
